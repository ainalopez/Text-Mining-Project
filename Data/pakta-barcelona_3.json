    "Where to start? I worked in a Peruvian restaurant for three years so I'm familiar with traditional Peruvian cuisine. But the way they played Peruvian food with the Japanese was awesome. There really wasn't one disappointing course out of the 10? The suckling pig, the sea bass ceviche with kimchi were standouts. All so good...And their pisco sour is a great drink.",
