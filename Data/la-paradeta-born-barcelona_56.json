    "Best seafood I have ever had, hands down. I was with four others and I think we all are on the same page that our meal was excellent. \u00a0Be prepared to queue outside and ready to order once you make it inside (and if you are looking for white table cloths and a quiet atmosphere, wrong choice). Fresh seafood on ice upon entry. \u00a0No frills, just seafood cooked simply with great flavor.The tuna was excellent with a garlic, olive oil, and parsley sauce. \u00a0The calamari, both fried and grilled, with the same sauce was exceptional. \u00a0The monkfish and shrimp were good, but the other options stole the show.Not the cheapest, but a good splurge option or go with multiple friends willing to split the bill so you can try a selection.",
