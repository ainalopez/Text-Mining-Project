    "Go there... but make sure you have a reservation. Otherwise, you might end up waiting in front of the door, wondering if you'll ever eat (the waiters are not very explicit as whether you'll finally have a table or not).Once you are there, try: the trio of buffalas (\u20ac16.50, to share), awesome and soooo huge; their asparagus pasta (\u20ac12), awesome; and the \u20ac12 bottle of house wine is quite good. Their classic lasagnas (\u20ac12) were average though - they were out of pesto ones, we were so sad!! The place loses one star due to service - not awesome to wait outside for 40 minutes without updates from the waiters, difficult to communicate if you don't speak Spanish, and a sloppy service overall (our waitress didn't know the price of the house wine and was pretty long to come to us when needed).",
