    "Time of Review: *September 30, 2011 @ 1:30pm, lunch for 2Service: *Seating is on a first come, first find, first serve basis! \u00a0We got there for a late lunch, and there were still a lot of people just waiting to pounce on an open seat! \u00a0We probably waited for about 20 minutes before we found an opening for 2.*Wait Staff - Pretty fast moving; once you were able to find a seat, they were quick about taking your order, serving, and getting you out of there =)Food Quality/Selection: Our 2 favorite dishes were the fried eggs with baby octopus (great recommendation from our foodie friend!) and the razor clams!Cost: It was rather expensive for some of the dishes....the egg/octopus dish was 19 euros! \u00a0We spent about 50 euros just for lunch!",
