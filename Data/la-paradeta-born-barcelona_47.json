    "There is something curiously familiar with this place, even if you've never set your foot here or even heard about it before... School!The interior design (or lack thereof) has a certain resemblance of your old class room from first grade!La Paradeta is a small chain of affordable, self-service, seafood restaurants in and around Barcelona. Somebody called it \"the Starbucks of seafood\", and the epithet is not all wrong.. And let me be clear: I don't particularly like conceptual restaurant chains.However, I do like La Paradeta!If you're early enough to beat the queue (make sure to be here minimum 15 min before opening), you'll have a feast of fresh seafood at low cost. If you're late you'll have a long waiting...Right by the entrance, you'll find the \"seafood bar\", where you'll pick your preferred catch of the day: be it fresh fish, lobsters, oysters, prawns, langoustines or clams, if you like seafood, you'll find your treat here! Actually, some of the best seafood I've had in a very long time! If you don't know Catalan (or Spanish), just use your body language to order.Following the order of your food, you'll continue to the drinks section, where a selection of wine and beer is offered, also at reasonably good prices. Pay (in cash), take your bottle of Albari\u00f1o (or whatever you decide to opt for), and find yourself a seat. \u00a0And don't forget your number!Here, there may be an advantage to know your number in Spanish, in order to pick up the right dishes (one by one, as they are being cooked) by the kitchen counter...Fun, really good and affordable - if you don't mind the waiting or doing part of the job yourself.",
