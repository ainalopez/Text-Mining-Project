    "Amazing! This place was recommended to us by the guys at Vesping. We had a full day of touring and riding and wanted something really good and local. El Glop is in a non touristy part of town. It was fun to stroll through the streets and to see families out at the local playgrounds and not just tons of tourists. We got there before 7- we still eat somewhat early- American time! Anyway we started with the sangria, it was really good! We had ordered the fried artichokes as an appetizer but I guess there was a lack of communication and it never appeared. That was ok, we got so much good food! We asked for bread and they brought us some huge slices of tomato bread; then our waiter drizzled olive oil on them. Good! We ordered 3 dishes to split among the 4 of us- the seafood paella, black rice with clams, and secreta pork- everything was so delicious! One of our favorite meals in Barcelona. We were too full to order dessert.",
