    "Not sure what happened. Went here tonight and asked to look at menu- which they graciously gave us. Then asked to sit outside which they said we could do. \u00a020 minutes later nobody came to take drinks. Someone came out to ask another couple what they wanted, but ignored us. Restaurant was not busy either. We eventually left. Not sure, maybe they do not like Americans. Lol",
