    "Came here based on the amazing Yelp reviews, and boy are we glad we did. Nuria, the lovely girl up front patiently explained how it all works: you choose your pasta and sauce, ravioli with sauce, or lasagne, and you also get a free drink and dessert all for less than 10 euros. Our favorites were the empanadas (beef, blue cheese, one with peppers and onions). Also loved, loved the veggie lasagne. It was so delish that my daughter, who usually doesn't like any kind of lasagne, loved it! The ravioli with arugula and cheese with tomato pesto was also amazing. Lucas, one of the owners, was super nice and charming. As with most restaurants in Barcelona, the place didn't get crowded until about 10 pm, and by that time we were done eating. Another big plus is that it's very kid friendly. There's a play area up front with lots of toys and a few easels for kids to create cool art while their folks are enjoying their meal. We loved it so much that we brought our sisters here when they arrived a few days later. We were all happy campers!",
