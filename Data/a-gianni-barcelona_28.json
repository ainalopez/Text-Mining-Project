    "My favorite Italian spot in Barcelona. Angelica and her family are wonderful hosts. The food is absolutely delicious and by far the best Neapolitan style pizza we have had anywhere. By the way, we are pizza snobs and eat it everywhere we travel. We also make our own gourmet pizza at home, so I am confident we know what we are talking about. Important to note is that they are much more than just pizza. They serve beef dishes, past dishes, fish dishes, seafood, etc... and they are all awesome. We went to eat here several times over our four week trip to Barcelona and each time was better than the previous. I have no hesitation to recommend this delicious restaurant to anyone. Please, go and enjoy the food and the wonderful attention. It is a family restaurant so please give your support. More places like this are needed across the globe!!! Say hi to Angelica and the crew!",
