    "Rekons is one of those perpetually busy places. \u00a0And with excellent reason: This place has it all! \u00a0The space is bright and airy, and the entire establishment opens onto a small number of outdoor tables and seats. \u00a0In the early afternoon and late evening you can pass by and see a huge variety of people hanging out, enjoying a beer and and some excellent food while soaking up the sun....Perfect for people watching!!Everything about Rekons is inviting. \u00a0Though quite busy, the staff is incredibly efficient and equally kind.Most important, though, is the delicious food! \u00a0The massive displays of dozens of different empanadas! \u00a0The enticing desserts! \u00a0The menu overflowing with delicious options! \u00a0You can pick anything from this place and rest assured that it will be extremely tasty! \u00a0I'm particularly a fan of the vegetarian empanada offerings they have: eggplant, leeks, mushrooms, squash and tomatoes abound in combinations that are so good you'll want another...and another!One thing: as Rekons is so good, you might need to wait to grab a table--especially outside. \u00a0There is always, though, the option of ordering some of those fabulous empanadas to go :) \u00a0Trust me, I've done it many times!Visit Rekons, you won't be disappointed!",
