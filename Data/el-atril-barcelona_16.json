    "We stopped by twice and were pretty satisfied with the food and drinks both times. We got a few pretty standard dishes, patatas bravas, seranno peppers, and a few local hams, etc., and everything was rather good. They also had live music on one of the nights we were there. Cool spot. Worth a visit.",
