    "This shows up on the top tapas bar lists in every one of our guide books and was highly recommended by a friend, so we booked in advance and got a table in the quieter back room (vs the very crowded bar area where I imagine it'd be hard to feel like you had any privacy at all). The fun of this place is warm and friendly servers bringing you plate after plate without you have to order. \u00a0It definitely feels like an authentic homestyle restaurant, so the dishes are more basic than those say at Cerverceria Catalana, and not quite as fancy as Paco Meralgo, but boy the food was still fresh and delicious. \u00a0We had the pan con tomate (good), fried calamari (okay), carpaccio with monkfish and sweet caramelized onions (delicious and refreshing), tuna tartare (okay), chicken croquettes (yummy), spinach croquettes (delicious), the fried poblano peppers (good, not as good as Mordisco), clams with bacon (distinctive, yummy), mussels (excellent and fresh, but a bit salty), potato omelette (good and creamy). \u00a0We also had the strawberry cup with lemon mousse, and creme catalon with caramelized ginger. \u00a0My friends enjoyed both desserts. We also enjoyed our wine a lot (proto). We all loved the experience, family restaurant ambience, and the friendly service. \u00a0 About 230 euros for 5 girls.",
