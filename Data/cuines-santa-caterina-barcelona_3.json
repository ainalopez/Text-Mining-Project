    "I disagree with some of the bad reviews that I've read below. Someone said that \"it's not just the place that has to be nice, but also the food\". Whenever I'm looking for a restaurant, I want the food to be specially well made. The place being nice, modern, or trendy is just a plus. Cuines Santa Caterina has a modern architecture as well as the market that surrounds it.I've eaten there twice and the food was really good on both occasions. If you're wondering wether it's pricey or not: what you pay is what you get. After orderning the dish of the day, a dessert and 1/2 a bottle of wine, the check didn't go over \u20ac25.There are also some negative reviews complaining that \"the place is full of tourists\". People tend to think that these type of places are \"tourist traps\" just because they look nice or because they offer an English menu right away. Fortunately this is not the case.",
