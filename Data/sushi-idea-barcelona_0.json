    "If you are looking for quality sushi, this is the place. \u00a0But if you are looking for one of the best value sushi places in Barcelona, this is also the place. \u00a0Dynamite combination of both. \u00a0The salmon was especially tasty in sashimi and nigiri, but they had this tartar salmon dish that was also quite good and very unique. \u00a0The service was speedy and friendly and I would go back in a heartbeat.",
