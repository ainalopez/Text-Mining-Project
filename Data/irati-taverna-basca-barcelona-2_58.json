    "A few years ago I went.. the place was hustling and bustling, and I liked it enough to keep the business card. \u00a0Came again... only tourists, and there is nothing wrong with that but heck, if not even the locals are there... the signs are dour...The couple we took were delighted with the self service and toothpick system. \u00a0It is not intimidating, and there is so many varieties without trying to figure out a menu. \u00a0So yes it is fun, but the food definitely had looked to be sitting around for a while. \u00a0BTW they charge per glass of water (for Americans who are used to tap water being free, and it was only filled halfway each time).It is a good easy intro to tapas, but the food is medicore.",
