    "I got food poisoning here! we had their lunch menu and started with the lobster carpaccio, then seafood soup (my cousin had the quail and risotto), and then we both had the turbot (type of white fish). The fish was delicious. About 2 hours later, I vomited 5-6 times over the course of 1-2 hours. Needless to say, I am unimpressed and blame it on that soup (sellfish velout\u00e9 is what the menu says). The soup was not very good, it had a variety of seafood, mussels, clams, squid, but it was like drinking sea water (strong sea smell). I'm disappointed in this Michelin restaurant.",
