    "The problem I had with this place was erm, emptiness. I was advised to go here on a high recommendation but, it was a slight disapointment as there were only four people on a Saturday night - two of whom were bar staff and then there was me and a friend. We went back again a few days later and it was much the same - there are not many other bar alternatives nearby either. Gracia is a really nice area and i'm pleased to have been tipped to go here - it really makes a refreshing change from the smelly streets, pick pockets and tackiness of the main port neighbourhood, but I feel it is best for eating out due to the array of restaurants and maybe Avenue Bar is best for afternoon tapas/brunch.Apparently run by an American and a brit, which explains the tasteful NYC/London standard decor, though hard to take in the atmosphere. I can imagine this being a great place with some people and i'd definately go back and try again.",
