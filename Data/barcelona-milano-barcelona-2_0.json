    "Fantastic meal! We stumbled in here last night during our visit to Spain and we were pleasantly surprised. The menu is very clearly tapas (Catalan and Italian dishes) and everything is served at a half portion size. They have a menu with English descriptions which is very helpful and the weight staff was tolerant of our language barrier. The manager also came and gave us recommendations on what to order (see below) and we enjoyed a great meal. Merlot - great bottle of wine for only 15 euro.Cuttlefish croquettes - the manager would not allow us to leave without trying this. We ordered a second round because they were that good.Bread and cured meat - Delicious and filling. Salmon Carpaccia - Only thing on the menu I wouldn't get again. This was WAY too salty for both of us.Carbonara spaghetti - Less creamy than what we serve in the U.S. Very tasty.Catalan sausage and white beans - sausage was delicious and the beans were cooked well (although not well seasoned).Grilled sirloin with herbs - Delicious. It is served EXTREMELY rare. For us, this was perfect and I loved the dish. But just a heads up. Espresso - perfect end to the meal.I left full. I think the number of dishes we ordered should be the right amount for most people. Go with a total of about 5 and you'll be happy.",
