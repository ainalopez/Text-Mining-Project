    "Loved this place. I have just returned from a 9 day trip to Barcelona the hotel recommended this place for dinner and I am so happy they did. We visited 3 times in 9 days. The food is wonderful with a great variety. The staff is friendly and patient with tourist, that may not be familiar with the selections. I recommend that you get here by 7pm if you want to eat at the bar (you do) as by 7:30pm it is super packed. Sitting at a table is fine, but the bar is so much fun.",
