    "This place was really comfortable. We were exhausted and just happened on it by accident. It offered mussels with every different kind of sauce imaginable. The woman who was working there that night was really lovely. We had the mussels with mustard sauce made with creme fresh which was super delicious. The mussels were cooked to perfection. My only complaint was that the mussels are steamed by themselves (for the majority of the dishes) and then the sauce poured over the mussels. So the mussels were cold and the sauce was warmish. The woman explained that they had to do it that way in order to keep the integrity of the sauce or the juice from the mussels waters the sauce down. It was very empty when we went and I wonder if we had gone when it was very busy if the mussels would have been freshly steamed and the sauce warmer.",
