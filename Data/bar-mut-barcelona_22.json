    "Arrived bar mut as a walk in Friday night. They have two seating sat 8 and 10. They squeezed my friend and I into a corner but at least they let us sit. This is the best dinner of my entire trip! Grilled octopus with potatoes is amazing! You cannot miss this! The octopus was melt-in-your mouth soft and not the rubbery chewy octopus I was so used to eating. You have not had good octopus until you have eaten this dish here. Also the Grilled prawns with pesto garlic sauce is seasoned really well.",
