    "Travel and Cake is essentially the same as its sibling brunch spot, Brunch and Cake, the main difference is that Travel and Cake seems to have more seating, a wider array of deserts (and donuts!) and more locals than tourists as opposed to Brunch and Cake. The food is very good, however I don't think it's as good as its sibling spot. Still a great place for brunch, and I would recommend it if you want to go to Brunch and Cake but the line is too long... It's only a few blocks away and there's donuts involved.",
