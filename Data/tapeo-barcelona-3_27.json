    "We ate at Tapeo two years ago and I had the best hamburger I'd ever eaten (the truffle burger). When restaurant planning, I asked Margaret Ann If we could return so that I could eat it again. She obliged.To my immense disappointment, the truffle burger was off the menu, replaced by a mushroom aioli burger. After getting over the initial burn, we ordered said mushroom aioli burger and several other tapas. Just as I remembered it, Tapeo was a nearly perfect neighborhood tapas bar. The only thing that keeps it from five stars is slightly curt service and cramped quarters (not in a charming way). The food itself is the best we've eaten on our two trips to Barcelona.Helpful hint: get a reservation. We watched multiple people wait an hour plus for a table. There is only seating for about 60, and I think the secret is out on this place. Not somewhere to just pop in.",
