    "Found this place on a quiet afternoon. \u00a0The streets were empty so we knew it wasn't the local dinner time yet. \u00a0Regardless, they were open for dinner and happily led us in. \u00a0Since we just got off the plane an hour ago, we were yearning for authentic spanish food. \u00a0So we ordered the the seafood paella, a pitcher of sangria, spanish quiche, calamari, and jamon. \u00a0Sounds like a lot huh? \u00a0Well, our group is 2 guys and 2 girls but the 2 girls can eat as much as the guys.Seafood paella - Presentation looks really nice. \u00a0Photo perfect in my eyes. \u00a0Since I'm surrounding by tasty choices in SF, I'm a little spoiled and would say this paella is pretty good but not mind blowing. \u00a0Like I said, it could be because I'm always around excellent food choices in SF that my standards are really high for paella. \u00a0The seafood paella can feed 4 people so don't be fooled by the menu when it says it serves 2.Jamon and bread - I'm a fan of pepperoni and salami so jamon is definitely up my alley.Calamari - Not too oily and not too much batter so that's a good thing.Quiche - Unsure of the name but it's potato-y (friend ordered it). \u00a0I'll pass on this one if I were you. \u00a0Not too much taste and you're better off carbing up with jamon and bread.",
