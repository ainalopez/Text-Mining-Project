    "The BEST MEAL I had in Barcelona! Not only is Kiosko in Mercado de la Boqueria, my favorite market in town for its 1 euro fresh juices, it has the best seafood and dishes I've tasted.It's difficult to get a table around Spanish lunchtime or even American lunchtime so if you don't want to wait, go early. When the seats around the bar are full, there is really no way in. The head chef does take a 'list' but he doesn't seem very organized so people just sit in any empty seat they can find. All the ingredients and kitchen are in the middle of the bar so it's a lot of fun to watch the chefs in action. You can see them make your food from raw ingredients to stovetop to plating/seasoning and it's a really exciting feeling to see your dish reach preparedness. We got 4 dishes (razor clams, sole, mushrooms, padron peppers) and loved them ALL, especially the razor clams and mushrooms. The padron peppers were also amazing but I've had great ones all over Catalonia. Prices here are not cheap (razor clams were 16 euro, mushrooms were 10 euro, etc) but it's worth it for the freshness and intense flavor. The only annoying thing was we didn't have enough cash since it was our last day in Spain and their credit card machine wouldn't work (bad wifi?). However, there are multiple ATMs in banks nearby.",
