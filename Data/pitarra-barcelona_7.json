    "Standards are important, and that is why I decided to go to a high end place for my first Paella in Barcelona. I was not disappointed. The paella with black rice was excellent, and I recommend you to try it. Service and food was good, and I was satisfied. This is not a place for young tourist out in Barca to party. Good for a quiet meal.",
