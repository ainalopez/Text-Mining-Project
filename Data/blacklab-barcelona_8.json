    "I went here for a break from doing some work, and that was the best decision I've made all week! This place is so fun, the bartender (Chris) was so nice, and the beer was great. I don't usually go back to the same place when I'm visiting somewhere, but I will definitely be back here before I leave Barcelona. They have some really interesting beers, including a Japanese-flavored beer made with sriracha and Japanese flowers. I went with a really good ipa. They have tours on Sunday's at 17 hours, which I am looking forward to attending!",
