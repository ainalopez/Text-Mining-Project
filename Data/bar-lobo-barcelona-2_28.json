    "Biggest disappointment in whole trip to Barcelona. \u00a0Service slow. \"Forgot\" to bring us bread. Tapas amateurish. Ordered Seafood rice after being told it was paella without shrimp. \u00a0It was paella without the flavor. A dozen mini clams and some calamari in a hot pot of rice and tomato sauce. My wife had eggs and ham but hard to screw that up. \u00a0I have never written a review before but this was so disappointing that it warranted my first. 8 million restaurants in Barcelona, go to any other one....any one at all.",
