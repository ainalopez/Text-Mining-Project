    "I came here for a jamon iberico baguette sandwich, and it was quite delicious! A lot of the jamon iberico was overly fatty, but I guess that's expected. The tomato spread was a great touch to the sandwich, and it made it less dry. My favorite part was the bread, which was surprisingly crunchy on the outside and soft inside. I thought the jamon iberico could have had more flavor, but maybe that's just how it is. The sandwich is greatly overpriced though at \u20ac6.75 for one; it could be for a snack, yet who spends that much on a snack?! Anyway, good place to try and have once in a while.",
