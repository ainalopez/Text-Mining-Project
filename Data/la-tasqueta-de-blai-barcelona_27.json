    "The unique thing about this place is the pinxtos - there are 25+ different ones to choose from and they are refreshed/new ones put out fairly often. Options are solid with a couple standouts. Each pinxtos costs \u20ac1; wine is \u20ac1; beer is \u20ac1,50.Great place for a late afternoon snack near parallel.",
