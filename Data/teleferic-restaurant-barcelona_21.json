    "Great restaurant! After being in Barcelona for 3 weeks, we were looking for a nice but affordable tapas buffet and definitely found it here. The tapas are laid out on the buffet, marked by price, and all look / taste beautiful! Price is really what you make it, because the tapa prices very, but is definitely affordable. All in all, I will be coming back to try more in the future",
