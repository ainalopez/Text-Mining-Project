    "Oh, La Champa\u00f1er\u00eda. You were recommended by so many people, so how could I not come here?The scene opens: Three people deep at the counter, Catalan only on the menu, bottles of champagne everywhere, and a mix of tourists and locals all crammed in and hoping for a few square feet of space to eat and take in the experience.The offering: smoked meats, cheeses, sausages and burgers (I think), sandwiches too, though I couldn't see them past the group of people to the counter.The selling point: absolute mayhem, anxiety-provoking but amazing food and the kind of experience you tell everyone about.Must do in Barcelona!",
