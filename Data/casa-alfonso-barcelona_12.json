    "Chose this due to lots of great reviews. Couldnt be happier. Had to wait few mins for a table and was seated at bar with a drink. Wait staff were friendly and helped with english translations. Food was amazing, had tapas of croquettes, patatas bravas, chorizo, tomato bread, omellette and risotto. Was more than enough for two. My veggie partner was very happy with the many veggie options. We didnt have dessert but they looked good. Finished off with a nice Cortado.Highly recommend visiting this place. It got very busy after 8:30pm so worth going a little earlier.",
