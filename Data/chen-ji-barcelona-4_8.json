    "Oh my gosh! I have found my Chinese restaurant! It is located in the Barcelona Chinese neighborhood (I don't know if we can call it chinatown yet). It;s a huge restaurant, with two floors and it is always packed, so plan ahead. First time I went it was a wednesday and Bar\u00e7a was playing, and I still \u00a0had to wait for a table. You have no decoration whatsoever, it is simple as it gets. The menu is amazing, they have at least a 100 plates to choose. The prices are really good, you can eat for less than 10 euros The waiters sometimes can barely speaks spanish, so you better show them the menu with the dish number. And the food is good, I recommend as many others had the Guotie. I've been 2 times so far, but I will be back to taste more of their delicacies.",
