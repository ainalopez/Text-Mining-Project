    "There are plenty of mixed reviews about this place here on Yelp and other review sites alike but if you manage to sift through the irrelevant comments, you will discover a great place worth trying. After a day at the beach, we headed over here for an early dinner (still busy, but no wait at all unlike peak dinner times). The interior is absolutely gorgeous; despite the age of the restaurant, it has maintained its illustrious looks and fine details for centuries.The staff was extremely attentive and helpful in assisting with explaining the items on the menu). We split an appetizer and ordered the black rice paella. I am not a fan of paella since all the ones I tasted before were too fishy but this one was delicious - best one I've ever had. It is a generous portion so it was the perfect size to split between two people. One thing that surprised me was the wine prices - very affordable. I thought the prices listed were for the glass, not the bottle.I would not hesitate to return here. I thought about knocking off a star because this place sets an unrealistic expectations for paella everywhere to compare to. I highly recommend this place.",
