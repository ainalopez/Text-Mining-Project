    "This place was recommended by our Italian friend who has lived in Barcelona for over 4 years and it did not backfire! \u00a0Like any other popular place in Barcelona my first tip is to go early (8 PM) we got there at 8 and by 8:30 it was packed! \u00a0Of course Pizza is what they are famous for but they offer other options. \u00a0We didn't have kids but it is kids friendly. \u00a0Great vegetarian option- we ordered their mozzarella salad and their garden salad, one margarita and their vegetarian dish! \u00a0Everything was absolutely made to perfection. I loved the fact that they had buffalo mozzarella options on the menu even though I decided to stick to my diet.",
