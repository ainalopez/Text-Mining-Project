    "I wanted some juice this morning and was so happy to find such a great place. Everything is fresh... You can point to the actual fruits you want juiced and watch the very friendly juicista (yes I just made that up!) make yours. He also was jovial about teaching us Spanish. We asked about the name.... Trying to speak German to him. The owner speaks German/is German, wasn't clear which. We didn't try food but it looked good. We will be back!",
