    "Last meal in Barcelona. 5 stars for the udon that is made on the premise, \u00a0which actually tastes good. \u00a0We watched the chef handle the raw dough. \u00a0 Order some appetizers because it's going to take a minute for the dough to be rolled out (machine). \u00a0The regular gyoza is solid. \u00a0Had the curry udon and the udon with kakiage (tempura shredded vegetables and shrimp).The only thing that could have improved my night was if there was just a dish of tempura \u00a0shrimp. Trip advisor bought me here. \u00a0Sometimes it lies but this time it made me happy.",
