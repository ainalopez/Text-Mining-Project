    "if you're a seafood lover, as i am, then you need to get your posterior to this place with the quickness. \u00a0i have never seen fresh oysters so large in my entire life. \u00a0everything was super fresh and very delicious and the wait staff was pretty awesome.we had shrimp, ysters, clams, chorizo, manchego, sardines, anchovies, calamari... the whole shabang-a-bang.if you're in the hood it would be well worth your time to eat here. \u00a0also, they have some of the most delicious desserts, in particular, the torta de santiago was the most delicious i've ever had.",
