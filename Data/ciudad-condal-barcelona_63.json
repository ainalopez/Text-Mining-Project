    "I saw on yelp and there are so many good reviews. I and my friends decided to come there for a diner. We waited for about 40 minutes for a table for 5 persons. The tapas was just average. The best dishes I think there were prawn skewers and beef tenderloin. There was just a small piece but it was really delicious, remarkable!! And the service was also very nice.",
