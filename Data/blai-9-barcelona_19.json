    "Ehh... I really wouldn't recommend eating here unless you have an expansive palette. The sangria was watery and only came by the liter...what's waste of money. If you sit at the bar, expect for people to reach over you all night to get fresh tapas. This is a self serve/ eat what we have tonight type of restaurant.",
