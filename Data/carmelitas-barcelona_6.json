    "Not only my worst meal experience in Barcelona, but my only bad meal experience in Barcelona. \u00a0I came very hungry and cold and the menu had lamb stew which sounded perfect. \u00a0Unfortunately the was almost nothing to actually eat in my meal. \u00a0The \"lamb\" was 90% bones and fat. \u00a0No joke. \u00a0There were a few potatoes and olives in there, but basically they fed be stuff that only a dog (or alligator) could eat. \u00a0I asked a guy at the cafe later if that was \"barcelona style\" or something, and he said no, it sounds like they fed me the parts of the lamb that they were supposed to throw away by mistake. \u00a0I agree. \u00a015 euros for water and bones and the service was rude and slow on top of that. \u00a0If I were you, I'd avoid this place completely!",
