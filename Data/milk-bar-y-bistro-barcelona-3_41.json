    "The Milk and Bar Bistros food was amazing! The Huveos Rancos was so good! However, it was very spicy, not to be eaten by people who are sensitive to taste. The Eggs Benedict Is the best breakfast food I've ever tasted! A place that you must go to when you are in Barcelona. Have a great meal!",
