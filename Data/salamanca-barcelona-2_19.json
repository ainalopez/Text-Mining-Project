    "My oh my, I'm still dreaming of the seafood paella! We had the seafood paella, 3 cokes, a large bottle of water,and flan for dessert and the total was 70\u20ac. \u00a0Although that sounds spendy, keep in mind that you also get some cured meats and tomato-rubbed bread at the beginning, and endless supply of almond cake, digestive shots at the end of your meal, and glasses of champagne if you check in on Yelp!Cured meats/bread- Nothing special, just something to get your palette ready.. Paella- Beautiful presentation, delicious flavor, and lots of seafood! I am still dreaming of this dish!Flan- Feel free to pass on this.. nothing memorable.. and we didn't even finish this small dish between 3 people.Almond cake- At first we were confused to see if this came with it or not.. a plate of 6 pieces, we dug in.. only to find ANOTHER place being served to us with another 6 pieces... I think this would have gone on for an unlimited supply, but we just had to stop eating. \u00a0The cake was moist, and not overly crumbly! Would order it even if it didn't come with our meal!An excellent value of delicious food. Come here, you won't regret it!",
