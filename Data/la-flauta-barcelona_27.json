    "Our host recommended this place. An amazing tapas spot near University of Barcelona. It was our first night in Barcelona and we were wowed by the food. We ordered a variety and my favorite was patatas bravas, the tomato bread and Spanish omelette. The Sauce they give with patatas was just mouth watering. Order an extra side of sauce to for all the other tapas plates. We also got a pitcher of sangria for a group of 4. Sangria was well made. The service is excellent and everyone is nice. Came is for another night before we left Barcelona.",
