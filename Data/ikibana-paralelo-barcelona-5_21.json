    "Hands down the best sushi I have ever had! and the best mojitos as well! You can't go wrong with any of the rolls you order. My reservation had about 7 different rolls and every single one of them was OUTSTANDING! Although it was pricey (especially for students studying abroad) it was worth every penny. Saving my money until I can return again. P.S. Don't forget to order a blackberry mojito!",
