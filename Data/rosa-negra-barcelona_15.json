    "Loved this place. We were fed up with all the tapas we had been eating and searched out a Mexican and came across this place on Yelp. The restaurant is easy to get to and is really nicely done up inside. Service was great and the staff were very friendly. Food wise we had pulled pork quesadillas and beef burritos - Both were excellent. Beer wise they have a few options and we went for modelo negras. In sum, great food, location and service. If you are in Barca you should really visit.",
