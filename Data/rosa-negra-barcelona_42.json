    "It was my birthday so my friend suggested we go here for dinner to celebrate. It's kind of confusing when you walk I'm whether you are supposed to wait to be seated or if you should just seat yourself so we just grabbed a seat at the bar. They have \u20ac3.50 mojitos. Make sure you stir it up or else you'll get a big sip filled with sugar which was an unexpected surprise. I was obsessed with the ice. I really couldn't get over how cool the ice cubes were. It's the simple things right? Anyways we started with the chips and guacamole which, be forewarned I'm pretty sure is not made with California avocados (!) but is still pretty tasty. For dinner I had the pulled pork quesadilla which was delicious. The meat was very flavorful. I don't usually order pork dishes but I may have to start. The service was pretty terrible. The girl all but snatched the payment out of my hand. Made me want my pretty epic 12% tip back... I can't get used to this whole not tipping thing.",
