    "After all the rave reviews I had some high expectations. I had the salmon and tuna sashimi and a dragon roll. Salmon and tuna were not at all cold. Just below room temperature. Gross. The dragon roll wasn't great either. My bf had chicken teriyaki and yakitori andwasn't impressed either. I don't think I'll be back",
