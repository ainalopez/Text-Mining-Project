    "My partner and I had our first official meal in Barcelona and it was delicious!!! We had the bread and tomato, garlic and shrimp, chorizo (egg and patatas), octopus and patatas, and watermelon sangria as well as the mixed fruit sangria. Loved it on so many levels!! The taste was perfect. My favorite was the shrimp and garlic as well as the octopus. My partner like the mixed fruit sangria and it was great for him because he doesn't like much sweetness in his sangria. I on the other hand love anything watermelon and was surprised how delicious this sangria was. I only wish I ate the paella too, but our lunch was adding up quickly from the few dishes we had bought. I do wish it was more affordable, but given the flavor, the quality of the food, and the location, I will gladly go back. Also, we wanted to try the different flavors of sangria which is why we got individual glasses, but definitely get the pitchers... such a great deal!",
