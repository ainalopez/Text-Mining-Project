    "I hate writing reviews like this, but we were so chapped by our experience here that I felt like it needed to be done. Maybe Gilda's management will read this and make it a teachable moment...We had the bright idea that we'd go to 3-4 different tapas bars around Barrio Gotic and El Born. This was our first stop. We talked to a staff person and were seated in the bar. We waited between 15-20 minutes without being acknowledged again. No menus, no water, no eye contact.We totally understand places getting busy and servers getting in the weeds, but a simple acknowledgment and apology would have gone a long way with us. As it was, we finally got up and left, truly lamenting -- for the first time in two weeks -- rude service and a food culture in which staff doesn't work for tips. When we told the guy at the bar we were leaving, he just shrugged. No apology, no nothin'. It wasn't his money that was walking out the door, after all. I felt bad for the poor owner of this place. It was embarrassing.",
