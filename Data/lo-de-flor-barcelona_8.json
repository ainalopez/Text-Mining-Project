    "What a find. This out of the way place was quaint and felt well off the tourist trail. Everything about this restaurant screams local and fresh...and delicious. The service was also very welcoming and informative. We were educated about portion sizes and well advised that our initial order was too much. After heeding our very knowledgable waitress's advice we wound up with perfect choices and portion sizes. The straciatella with tomato appetizer was outstanding as was the foie gras. The eggplant Parmesan was the best we have ever had anywhere. The flan dessert was a great finish. This restaurant made for our best night in Barcelona. The only thing keeping the rating down was the room was a little warm. Overall I would recommend this great spot to anyone.",
