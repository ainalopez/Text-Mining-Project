    "This place is fantastic! Our hotel was in the central tourist area so all the restaurants there were pretty expensive compared to the ones we've seen in Madrid. I found this awesome establishment on yelp and it was only about a 15 minute walk away from our hotel. It was far enough from the tourist area, but close enough for walking distance.When we walked in, there was a smorgasbord of pintxos! AND the price was right! It was 1 euro per pintxos which is cheap and the drinks were cheap too! I had their house wine which was only 1.20 euro and it was tasty. They had all kinds of pintxos, but my favorite ones were the ones with sausage because it was packed with flavor. Best meal for your euro!",
