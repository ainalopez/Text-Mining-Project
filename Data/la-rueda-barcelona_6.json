    "First of all this is not a Catalan restaurant but Uruguayan. If you like meat this is the place for you. If you are starving you also came to the right place as the portions are big. Very friendly priced and reservation is recommended. At night around 22:00 and in the afternoon around 14.00 this place is packed. Can't go wrong with this place.",
