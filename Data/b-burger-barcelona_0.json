    "Not just one of the best burgers in Barcelona, one of the best burgers anywhere.How it was that I found myself alone in this place on a Thursday night at 9:30 p.m. is due probably more to the out-of-the-way location of this place than the quality.I had an outstanding burger here, cooked between medium rare and medium, with bacon, cheese and a fried egg on top. \u00a0Everything about it harmonized and I ended up not adding any ketchup or mustard.The patatas were cooked perfectly and garnished with sea salt and also didn't need any condiments to improve upon them.With a couple of coke zeros, the final bill was around 16 euros.Note: \u00a0They don't speak any English here, so be prepared to order in Spanish or at least do a bit of pointing.",
