    "The one thing I was looking forward to the minute i entered into Spanish property was to devour every grain of paella possible. But instead I decided to go to the best.I yelped for Paella and went to the highest rated location which was Bosque Palermo. This place is located in the La Ramblas area mixed in with a thousand other tapas and paella joints. It is a small mom-and-pop location. You walk in and you will see a small bar on the left with a small tapas station. To the right and back is the dining area. I ordered the seafood Paella and got a ginormous platter only to be devoured within 20 mins. Their sangria was very strong but that's how i like it. They also give you some bread to start but nothing special with that.Outside the restaurant are a few seats for outdoor eating, however with bugs and garbage and cars driving, it's not really the greatest spot. Plus you have a bunch of old regulars sitting there smoking half the time.Keep in mind that to get the best food you must go to the more rustic locations.I miss Paella now after writing this.",
