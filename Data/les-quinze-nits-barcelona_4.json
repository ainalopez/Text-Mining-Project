    "Have you ever heard the saying Go where the locals go they know where the good food is OR If you see a lot of people the food must be good!....Well this place came Highly recommended by several locals as a place you MUST go eat!.... they lied to me!, the best thing this place has going for it is the atmosphere of the outdoor dining area because the food really sucked...Paella Mixte (\u20ac8.50 x 2) yelp.com/biz_photos/les-\u2026 I guess/think the Paella's are made in various sizes the minimum is a two person size which is what you see. VERY WET MUSHY RICE, lacking in flavor and not much Seafood when you split this between two adults! Not much more to say but very disappointed.....",
