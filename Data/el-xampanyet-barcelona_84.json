    "This place is great! Standing at the bar is the best experience. The owner is @ the bar serving and supervising and I felt like we were best friends by the end of our time there. The tapas aren't really tapas, more like pinoxtos (really small). Everything we ordered was delicious. But I would have to say the best was the cheese stuffed red bell peppers, don't go there without trying these (like a tiny little explosion in your mouth). The place can get very busy, and bit intimidating if you don't speak the language, so arrive early if you can, or just pull up your big girl panties and push through the crowd and smile as you use the 4 spanish words you know!",
