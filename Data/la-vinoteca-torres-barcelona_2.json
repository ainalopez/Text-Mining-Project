    "Cute wine bar in the middle of a busy Barcelona street. My friend and I decided to stop here for a drink which turned into a few haha. We didn't spend much time inside because we chose to sit in their outdoor area on the street. The thing I loved most about this place was the excellent service. Our server was so nice and attentive and the wine she recommended was so good.Tip: beware of relentless beggars if you choose to sit in their outdoor section! (Keep your stuff off the table).",
