    "With endless Tapa places in Barcelona, Bodega was sure unique in every which way.Based on service alone this place deserves 5 stars but with the limited food options and non table cloth along with semi self serve I'll have to give it 4.The spicy chicken satay/on stick was the best. They don't accept credit cards so do carry cash. It houses 10-12 tables so either go earlier or be prepared for a 25-40 min wait which to me was totally worth it.They have English speaking staff so language will not at all be a problem (if English is your first language).You are seated and can order drinks. The house Rioja wine was great. You are then asked to wait until the server comes get you and walks you to the food display. You can from there on select the tapa and amount as per desired. They keep making them fresh but the ones you select are the ones you'll be getting at your table after they have been heated up in the oven or over the grill.Overall it's a fun wall in the whole restaurant, great for any one looking to eat at the gothic quarter.",
