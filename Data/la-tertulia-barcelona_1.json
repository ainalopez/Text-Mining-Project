    "As with all other places we happened upon in Barcelona, Yelp helped us out.We walked here from our hotel (not too long, but not really a short walk) and it's located in an area with a bunch of tapas places, dessert/bakeries as well as a casino! No frills and also minimal understanding of English, but thankfully I had a translator app to help out. We ended up ordering the potatoes with the mayo and spicy sauce (SOOO GOOOD) and we ordered the number 1: chicken with croquettes and russian salad - i think it might've been tuna) and number 2: steak, fried egg, salad and french fries.Very filling, not too expensive. Nice little area to walk around after dinner.",
