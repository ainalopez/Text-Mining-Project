    "Because of the good reviews here, we decided to have dinner here. I ordered a piece of meat and it tasted good. Unfortunately it was a bit crowded and the waiter was all by himself. So we had to wait very very long for everything. 20 minutes for order taking, 40 minutes for the bill. The restaurant also did not had very nice atmosphere. I don't recommend this place.",
