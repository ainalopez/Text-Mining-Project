    "We didn't have a reservation and as soon as they found out, they wouldn't give us the time of day. One of the patrons at the bar yelled \"No Englishmen\" at us. We're not even English! We waited around for a while, hoping the waitress was just busy, but she went through a couple of tasks and still didn't bother even giving us a table. So we went to Comestibles next door and they were nice. Try their mojito!",
