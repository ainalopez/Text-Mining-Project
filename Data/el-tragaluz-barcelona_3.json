    "My meal here was probably my favorite meal in Barcelona. We started with the Iberian ham and a vegetable dish. The Iberian ham was phenomenal. I then had the octopus, while my girlfriend had a steak. Again, both dishes were great. We finished with a fantastic creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.The atmosphere was great - modern, relaxing, and spacious. Definitely come here!",
