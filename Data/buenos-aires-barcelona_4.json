    "A 300g ribeye steak grilled to perfection (medium-rare) with a baked potato. A waiter who knew his meat and an ice-cold Argentinian beer to wash it all down.I will say no more!You may wanna make reservations since this place is very popular. I had to sit outside with my jacket on but I still rate it 5-stars!",
