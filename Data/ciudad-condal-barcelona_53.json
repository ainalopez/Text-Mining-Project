    "Thirty minute waitAt 6PM on SundayBut, oh so worth itI probably should have written this review closer to the visit when my memories were fresher, but it was absolutely one of the favorite meals of my life. \u00a0Our waiter's English was not the greatest, but good enough to get by. \u00a0We mostly just took his recommendations, and he did not lead us astray. \u00a0Everything was delicious: calamari, patatas bravas, steak sliders, french fries topped with runny egg, to name a few. \u00a0Everyone in our group was in consensus: this is a five star place.As many of the reviews state, this place is always crowded. \u00a0Even at the early hour of 6PM in Barcelona, we had to wait a half hour for a table. \u00a0Thanks for the recommendation, Charlene. It was bomb dot com and well worth the wait.",
