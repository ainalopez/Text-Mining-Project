    "Our final night in Spain and we capped it off with the best meal of our trip. This place is super small, recommend only for couples. If you have a bigger party, you won't be able to sit together or will have a really long wait! I can't say enough about how good the tapas are here. They are all warm tapas, but you have a large variety of choices, including meat and vegetarian. Everything was delicious, please eat here if you are in Barcelona!!!!!",
