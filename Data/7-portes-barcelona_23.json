    "If you didn't call in a reservation, DON'T bother! They don't deserve your money. We read about this place in the EyeWitness Travel book and were excited to check it out. When we got there it was a confusing experience in finding the right person to try and reserve a table. After 45 mins of waiting... the only seating was an Outside Table. When I protested, we were reminded that we should've called in a reservation. \u00a0The smell of car exhaust ruined any suggestion that this was a great place to dine. I won't even bother with the food. If you're inside I'm sure it'll be a star better. Save yourself the trouble. Book somewhere that actually wants to give you a great memorable experience. 7 Portes was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. Insult to injury... Poking my head inside, there were a number of empty tables. The pianist was playing a wonderful song. Soooo.... Maybe if I planned my trip. Planned on going there... Maybe it would've been the 4 star experience to match the bill, but it wasn't, and the hostess was useless. \u00a0Every vacation has that one place, where it just didn't work; 7 Portes has been that place for us on this trip.",
