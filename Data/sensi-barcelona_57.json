    "Sensi is my idea of the ideal Barcelona restaurant.Dimly lit ie romantic small restaurant. Safe neighborhood. Reasonable prices. and oh yeah, everysinglethingweorderedwasdelicious. Think spanish tapas + modern influences. Waiter also spoke English, major plus.Don't order the: Paella. Yes, little wee bit too much salt. Best meal of my life? By far no. But it was enjoyable, overall well cooked, and we came out full and happy.",
