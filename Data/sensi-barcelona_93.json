    "If I lived in Barcelona, this would be our regular watering hole. Fabulous food at reasonable prices. Friendly owner and staff. Felt very welcome. Made reservations online.Had the jamon iberico (when in Barcelona ... was great by the way) with pan con tomate (don't understand why they can't make a decent version in the States, with the exception of Jaleo), pimientos de padron (my wife's favorite), patatas bravas (excellent), duck timbale (Fantastic), the flank steak (yummy), the filet with black pepper sauce (yummier), \u00a0duck confit (yummiest), seafood paella (Good). No room for dessert. Along with Tickets, the place I would go back to Barcelona for.",
