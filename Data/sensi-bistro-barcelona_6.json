    "The place was busy and vibrant. Staff were very professional and suggested items on the menu. Comparing portions, each tapas is usually the size of a woman's fist. The food was so delicious and fresh. The menu has items that are marked \"(The Best)\" beside them...They really are! I had the tuna tartar, the duck and then the Cheese cake dulce de leche! It was so good! Go to this place! Don't think! JUST GO!",
