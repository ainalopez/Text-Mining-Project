    "A real surprise while we were traveling through Barcelona. We mustered up the energy to drop in one evening after the both of us caught a mild cold and was sick of pintxo, tapas and paella. We were immediately greeted by who we assumed was the, or one of the, owners. Tall, bald caucasian guy who had a real passion for ramen, or all things Japanese. Although he was expecting a large party, he made an exception and promptly seated us. We ordered the picante (spicy miso) ramen with some gyoza. Really had no expectations as the last time we had ramen (in Dublin, IRE) was terrible. Koku's broth and noodle texture was really great. Although it's not heavy in flavor like Ippudo (NYC) or Orenchi (Santa Clara, CA) it was still full and dense. I added a bit more chili, my wife thought it was just fine. In short, the ramen did not disappoint, but the highlight was the gyoza. I would come back just for those. It's rare that you find a place that does great in-house gyoza and Koku certainly does. It's also in a great neighborhood with late night activities. That bowl of ramen lifted our spirits enough that we went bar hopping afterwards. Found a great spot for Sangria just a few steps away, not to mention a tiki bar and an actual bar after that. If you're feeling like ramen in BCN, Koku's a solid option.",
