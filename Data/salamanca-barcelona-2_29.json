    "The food here is terrible and very expensive. The vegetables were cold. The monkfish was partly uncooked. The bread brought at the beginning was soggy and not at all appetizing. The paella was mostly rice and of mediocre taste. \u00a0The setting is very nice on the outside patio. But the restaurant is set up for unsuspecting and gullible tourists. I would like to give this restaurant zero stars since Barcelona is full of excellent restaurants with authentic food at reasonable prices.",
