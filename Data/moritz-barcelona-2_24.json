    "Moritz is conveniently located next to my hotel Gran Ronda. I came over here because of close proximity and the ambiance it projected as I walked by. If you are in this area, an excellent choice for a glass or two of vino. I was traveling alone so sat at the wine bar side room and the sommelier was extremely knowledgable and helpful w picking wines that were DELICIOUS! Food was yummy too!",
