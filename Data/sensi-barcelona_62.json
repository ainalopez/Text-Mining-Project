    "1. Not a fan of the kid in front promising to personally come get us at a nearby bar - never showing and pulling the same stunt on other foreigners.2. The food was mediocre at best. We had the bravas, squid, tuna tartar (the best dish of all), and the suckling pig. All I can honestly say is meh; finally an honest review of this place.3. Service was machine-like and impersonal.4. We were charged for water and bread. I mean it's tap water man... For 2 euros. We asked for more water, politely, (turning down more wine) and were ignored... We won't come back and think that any food loving tourist should heavily avoid this spot. Looking forward to better in Barcelona.",
