    "You really want these balls in your mouth. It's a tiny and simple but simply delicious and affordable place. The balls are fantastic, especially we love the sweet potatoes bomba-croqueta, the pork meatball, and the beef meatball. All comes with a taziki style sauce and tasty mini buns. Good hummus to share too. Two or three balls is enough per person or part of a larger Raval tapas tour. A great cheap find!",
