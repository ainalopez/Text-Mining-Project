    "New \"Nikkei\" (Peruvian/Japanese cuisine) from the Adria brothers who post El Bulli are moving on to exploring and exploiting \"niche\" cusines. Opened just a month ago, Pakta, located in the same edgy neighborhood as 41 and Tickets, offers up a 90\u20ac, 25 course tasting menu from chefs Kyoko Ii and Sebastian Mazzola (of 41). Highlights included avocado tofu with yuzu and salmon roe, seabass ceviche with kumquat leche de tigre and lomo saltado, sirloin steak grilled with peppers and a quails egg. It's fun, friendly, exciting and highly recommended.",
