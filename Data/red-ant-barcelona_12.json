    "Overpriced bad service. My friend had to argue to get the table she reserved for us. The staff treated us like we were begging for food instead of paying for it, literally. We got yelled at, scolded, they even denied the service to me and some of the friends who came a bit later, claiming \"there wasn't any more space and we had to wait outside\". I give it two stars because aparently everyone was happy with their meals, even though it was a bit pricy. If zero were the minimum, it'd give it just one. I'm definitely not coming here again.",
