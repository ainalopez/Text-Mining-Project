    "We've been in Barcelona for 3 days and I still did not try tapas. This place had good reviews and was close to the place we stayed so my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to check it out. The atmosphere was very homey and the staff very friendly, they speak some English which was very helpful. However, menu reflected not tapas but similar to tapas food that was called pinchos: hot and cold. They cost \u20ac1.65 per one and mainly is different stuff on a baget slice. We liked most of them, but my favorites were salmon one, hot cheese one with pepper and hot fish ones. Red wine Sangria was very tasty as well.",
