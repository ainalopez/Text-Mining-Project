    "Unbelievable pizza with a little kick. I had the Margherita which was excellent. Two slices for 4 euros. The owner is friendly as well and came from Italy. \u00a0Best pizza so far in Barcelona. Greay thin slices and quite a good variety. Seems like the pasta was good as well amd freshly made. Highly recommend. In the old section of Barcelona not far from the Picasso museum",
