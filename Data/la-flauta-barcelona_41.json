    "Great place for a nice Barcelona meal. We came here after our friend recommended it for our trip. It was by far our favorite spot, which is why we went twice.The place is really nice and pretty large. It gets really crowded by 9 pm, but we walked in and we had a table within 30 minutes. So go earlier or go whenever and grab a drink while you wait. The good was great. Everything we had was tasty, but our favorites were the Spanish omelet, papas bravas, and calamari. The portions are pretty good, so don't order too much. The wine selection was solid and not excessively expensive. I really don't think you can go wrong. Service was pretty solid. The first time it was better, but still attentive the second time. I doubt you can find friendlier people. Go to this place!",
