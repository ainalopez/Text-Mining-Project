    "This food is a religious experience. You'll be making noises that embarrass you. Try everything! Ask for sample plates! You'll be astonished at how inexpensive your bill is. My friend and I stuffed our faces for the better part of two hours, and our bill was 30 Euro. The hours are at the discretion of the owners, usually from about 15:00 to 22:00 Monday through Friday. The hotel next door usually knows if there is a change in this and can tell you when to come back if they're closed. Can't wait to come back!",
