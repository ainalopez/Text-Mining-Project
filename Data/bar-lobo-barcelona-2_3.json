    "What a great find on Yelp!Hubby and I picked this place after wandering around the quieter part of La Rambla. We were promptly seated though the restaurant was packed for lunch. I wanted something comforting so I ordered their pesto rigatoni. I also noticed another patron sipping on something green so I politely asked for a green juice too! I love having the option of drinking my greens when I'm out and about.This restaurant is trendy, modernly decorated and lovely. There is plenty of seating inside their dining area, bar, and a few tables outside. The toilets are located upstairs. They're marked \"H\" (hombres - men) and \"M\" (mujeres - women) which may confuse English speakers.We didn't have to wait too long for our food. My rigatoni was perfectly prepared and was a great lunch. Hubby enjoyed his food too. Service was good, but they do things a little more leisurely so if you're on a schedule, just keep an eye on the clock so you won't be late to your next destination. Can't wait to return.",
