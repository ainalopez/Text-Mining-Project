    "Our favorite meal in Barcelona! AMAZING tartar. They do have the two tapas per person rule, which was not a bother to us at all - we ordered far more than that! I suggest getting a reservation - we happened to snag a spot on a Monday but we got very lucky. Small place with friendly staff and tasty drinks. Don't miss Sensi while in Barcelona!!",
