    "Ok so I come to Barcelona every year for Mobile World Congress and this is my go to for cocktails and tapas. It is without a doubt the BEST gin bar in the world....simply fantastic the care the bartenders take making a drink. And while not a whisky aficionado they make the best old-fashioned! Enjoy.",
