    "This was the first tapas place we went to after arriving in Barcelona earlier in the day. Admittedly, going to a bustling tapas bar was kind of intimidating, but this place was welcoming and the service was friendly. We got maybe 5 tapas plates to share, the most memorable ones being:- cured ham montadito - three cheese montaditoI wished both were a tad bigger so I can eat more of it. I did enjoy the grilled mushroom tapas plate, the flavour was spot on - I did find it too oily though. Overall, good experience here. Food was heavy, but maybe that's expected here. Mushrooms a little oilyHeavyWelcoming for tourists Service great",
