    "We wanted an early dinner, and the Grill Room was recommended to the 6 of us. We had just flown in that morning & were looking for a nice dinner of paella. All 6 of us ordered it. We were disappointed in the quality. Dark & muddy looking, it contained very little seafood (1 shrimp, 2 mussels) but had a few fatty & boney pork pieces. Needless to say, we dont recommend the paella. However, to be fair, we saw several other meals go by our table that looked wonderful. I guess you have to sit for awhile & watch what goes by before ordering. Lol on a positive note; the house red wine was nice & pretty inexpensive. The padron pepper appetizer was very good too. The atmosphere was great too. One time here was enough for the six of us",
