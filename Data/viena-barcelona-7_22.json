    "one happy gluten free girlOk so it's basically like a really fancy McDonald's but its pretty dang good. I am gluten free so was overjoyed to find a place literally next to my hotel that had so many gluten free options including bread. Note it's called celiac here they don't recognize gluten free. Also the gf bread wasn't hard and didn't break apart like most it was amazing! I am from the states and found the prices decent bc in the states there is in up charge for gluten free at alot of places but not here. It's worth checking out if your looking for a sandwich. I spend 11 euro on 2 sandwiches and 2 fries",
