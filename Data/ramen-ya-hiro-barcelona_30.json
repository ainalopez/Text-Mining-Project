    "Me and my husband are both ramen-holic in Taiwan. We've even traveled to Japan for best ramen. This is our first time in Barcelona and it was our 10th day here. We really miss some Asian food. Finally we found HiRo and it was just amazing! Since the first bite we know that it is traditional Japanese style and the noodle and the soup are both perfect. We ordered Miso and Soja, both highly recommended! We tried some other ramen places in Barcelona. This one is definitely the best!",
