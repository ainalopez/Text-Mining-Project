    "As far as gastronomic meals go, this was probably less fussy and showy than most. But you're still stuck with a set menu, one that in our case included such stomach-turning cruelties as foie gras and suckling pig. I ate them; so I am basically just venting my guilt. Also, the service was almost too enthusiastic. It felt like they were really selling each dish. Everything we ate was good, and some of the items were truly great, like the lettuce ice cream, and like the raw scallop dish.",
