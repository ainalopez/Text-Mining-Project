    "We were walking around town today and came across this stop for lunch! The pizzas were very fresh and tasty. If we lived in Barcelona we would definitely come often. The place is pretty crowded for seating but that is a good thing cause it shows us how good they are, and the staff were super friendly. We will be coming back!",
