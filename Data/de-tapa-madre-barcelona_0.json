    "Cozy, friendly and moderately priced.Chardonnay cava was outstanding for 14 EuroTomato bread, touted as the best. I don't know about that but pretty delicious.-could have used a little more tomatojamon, could have been better. 13.80 Euro for 50 grams...was tasty but as I learned later was dry because it was near the bone so the leg has been cut for a while.Patates bravas, i'm not a fan of the dish itself but was crisp and tasty enough.Lamb Stew, was yummy and comfortingOver the next 7 days, found myself wanting to go back for cava and bread.",
