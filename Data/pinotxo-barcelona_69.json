    "It's hard to miss this place when you come into La Boqueria.The first time I went to Barcelona I had walked straight past this place. Still to this day, I'm not sure how I managed that.Anyway, seating is at a premium. Best place is at the bar so you can see what's going on.It was busy but we were fortunate to be behind a kind couple who were close to finishing their meal. It gave us the time to spy on what other people ordered.All the dishes we ordered (a pretty much random selection) were very good.We had some steak, a chicken leg that was a bit like coq a vin in a lighter sauce and even some simple potatoes. Those are the dishes I remember well, I know we had a few more, but they were all good.It gets pricey which is not that surprising when you consider where this place is.Definitely worth a try. Don't forget your wallet!",
