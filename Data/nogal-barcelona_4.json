    "Excellent food and service, traditional spanish \"old school\" ambience. We had a great time and got recommendations while ordering tapas. Ended having a feast with great tasting traditional spanish tapas.The owner brought us the best of the house, a plate with Jamon Iberico and toast, and explained how they eat it in Catalunya.",
