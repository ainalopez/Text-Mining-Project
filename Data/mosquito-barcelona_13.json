    "Dark and bustling inside This place really ain't what you expect when you head in off the sunny Barcelona street outside. This place has a great atmosphere that makes you feel you could be miles away from Europe. The place is always mobbed and with good reason. The food is amazing. We had deep fried and boiled dumplings and both tasted spectacular. One beef and one veggie, I can't fault either of them. We also shared a huge bowl of spicy beef soup. (I forget the exact name) It was again lovely, total taste sensation and a welcome change from all the tapas we had eaten to that point. The array of bottled beer on offer is huge, with brands from across the world. Something there for everyone. Final thought/hint. Menu is only in Spanish and Chinese. We asked one of the waitresses for a bit of help though and she kindly ran through the whole thing separating the beef from the pork and the soup from the dumplings. Great food, friendly staff and cool beers. Plus the best dumplings I have ever tasted. You should visit if you get the chance.",
