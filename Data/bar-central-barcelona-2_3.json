    "My friend and I stopped by the Mercat de la Boqueria to look around and stumbled upon this place. We didn't get a chance to Yelp it but by the looks of the ever growing line and the packed seats at the counter coupled with the fresh seafood laid out for your visual enjoyment and the MANY MANY MANY happy faces of their customers, how do you NOT stop and find out what the fuss is about?!We ordered calamari, HUGE prawns, mussels, oysters and everything came out fresh, hot and fast!! My favorite by far was the prawns and no joke, would've swapped out the other 3 dishes and ordered ONLY the prawns. They were sweet, juicy and melt in your mouth. I loved the fact that most of their dishes were seasoned with olive oil and sea salt as to not muddle the freshness of their main focus - the seafood! Be prepared to shell out a few euros cuz fresh & delicious ain't cheap!",
