    "Some restaurants have it and some don't. It is a combination of food, atmosphere, service and a general ambience with having all the tables full and vibrant with people. 7 Portes has it all. We of course had seafood Paella. It did not disappoint. Absolutely plenty of locals when we went, many of them regulars by familiarity of them and the service staff. We were treated equally as well. We went there for lunch, had a reservation and shorty after we arrived the restaurant was full.",
