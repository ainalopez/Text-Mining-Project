    "Trendy, inexpensive and chill!! Everything you'd want in a bar :)My friends and I rested here after a long day of wandering and site-seeing. It's two stories: the tables upstairs are more quiet and private, and the area also has a cute balcony (not to sit on, but just a cute viewing point). My two friends and I split a pitcher of the Sangria which was fizzy! It was the best sangria I've had and was so fresh. The bartender (and possibly manager/owner) Wendy, is super nice and accommodating! She was so cool and very helpful. She speaks English, French and Spanish!We needed help getting directions to the airport the next day and she provided us with some transportation options.It was a great place to relax a bit before our next plans",
