    "Really delicious food and cocktails, but terrible table service (even by European standards). At around 7:30pm we tried to order nachos, and were told that we had to wait until 8pm. Meanwhile, a couple literally right next to us (who had a different server), received and enjoyed nachos while we were trying to order ours. When we tried to order again at 8pm, our waitress had disappeared for about 20 minutes (turned out her shift ended and she just didn't tell anyone). By the time we were able to get someone to take over our table, they told us we couldn't order because a large party was arriving in about 30 minutes. By this point we'd been trying to order food for over an hour. We finally got it (and it was good), but we had to go inside.",
