    "I found out about this place from a local elite yelper's review in Spanish. \u00a0We were so glad we made the trip here twice (Once for dinner and dessert and once for dessert and wine). \u00a0This place has everything and a hip local and international vibe to its ambiance to back it up. \u00a0Extensive and reasonably priced cocktail lists greet you in the doorway after you steal your away from the gorgeous Palau de la Musica across the street. \u00a0A mixture of hip local and international people at tables and at a bar that takes up one side of the restaurant inspire you to consume, converse, and enjoy all that this top tapa destination has to offer. \u00a0Glass after glass of Verdejo compliment traditional Empanada or more fusion-esque offerings such as an ahi sashimi or Catalonian spring rolls. \u00a0The homemade dessert menu is incredible as well. \u00a0I highly recommend this place! \u00a0Check this place out! \u00a0Another great yelpy feast and night of celebration awaits you!",
