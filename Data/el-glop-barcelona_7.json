    "We originally were going to Cerveceria Catalana but was put off by the long wait and the rushed atmosphere so we came across this place instead. We were not disappointed with the Great flavorful food and hearty portions. The steamed mussels tasted fresh and are a must. The octopus with black rice was pretty good too. The staff was very friendly and service was fast.",
