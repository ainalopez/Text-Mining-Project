    "Great little tapas bar with good food and wine! Very welcoming vibe with an American bistro feel to it! The kitchen opens until 11:30, which was a plus since we found this restaurant after an 8-hour fast! \u00a0I loved the old school charm in the restaurant. \u00a0We ordered 3-4 tapas to share plus a bottle of white wine to go with our meal! \u00a0The food came out quickly given that the kitchen was closing. \u00a0We ordered cheese with foie gras and pear, garlic mushrooms, Catalan tomato bread and a meat dish. \u00a0Everything was very tasty and satisfying! \u00a0I especially liked the tomato bread! \u00a0The prices were very reasonable for the portions you get. \u00a0Overall, this is a decent restaurant with good food for late night dining!",
