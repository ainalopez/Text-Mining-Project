    "i love this place. \u00a0we just landed in barcelona and came straight to pinotxo bar. \u00a0i'm glad we missed the lunchtime rush, as we came around 3 pm. \u00a0you don't order, but the lovely mr pinotxo suggested items for us. \u00a0carne for the boy, pollo for my girlfriend, and pesce for me. \u00a0we had no idea what we were going to get. \u00a0he started us out w/ some chickpeas and cava too. \u00a0for my guy friend, he presented a lovely sausage. \u00a0for my girl friend, 2 pieces of stewed chicken w/ dried apricots and prunes. \u00a0for me, scrambled eggs w/ asparagus, onions, and shrimp. \u00a0everything was fabulous. \u00a0i can't wait to go back tmrw!",
