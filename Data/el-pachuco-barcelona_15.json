    "Very yummy tacos. We had the carnitas and the papas y chorizo. The restaurant itself has a cool vibe, and the owner has a vibe to match.It's easy to order --\u00a0just mark how many tacos you want on the paper menu! As you can tell by the other English reviews here, it's pretty friendly to people who might not speak Spanish.",
