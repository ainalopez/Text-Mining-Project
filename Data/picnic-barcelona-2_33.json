    "Good food. Ordered Tapas for dinner with the family. Rather than setting the table with a handful of things, they brought out 8 orders one by one, waiting for us to finish the small dish together before bringing the next dish in. This is something some people actually prefer! You get to focus on the individual taste of each food item. I, however, prefer to have a handful come at once. In any case, the food was solid. No problems with anything ordered.Their dinner menu, however, is a bit limited. And the service was slow. Waited about 20min for my bill. In any case, tasty food if you want tapas for dinner!",
