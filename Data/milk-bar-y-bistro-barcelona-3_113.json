    "Great stop to get an American style brunch in Barcelona. \u00a0My wife and I were pleasantly surprised about the quality of the food. \u00a0Everything that was coming out of the kitchen looked amazing.I had to knock off one star though because of the smoothies (which we didn't even order). \u00a0We sat at the bar and we noticed how the bartender would neglect to clean out the blender after he made each smoothie. \u00a0Instead he would leave the remnants sitting in the pitcher so that he could blend them into the next smoothie order. \u00a0These remnants would sit there until another smoothie order came in (probably about 20 minutes between orders while we were sitting there). \u00a0We felt if this wasn't a health code violation, that it should be and felt sorry for anyone that was ordering these smoothies.While the food was really good, I don't think we'll be back.",
