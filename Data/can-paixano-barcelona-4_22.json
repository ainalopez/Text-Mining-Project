    "Those croquetas! Yes please! Husband and I both got the bocadillos. Very good but could have used some sauce, I think. A bit on the dry side, but still VERY tasty. Wish there was a place to sit down, but we found a nice bench nearby to enjoy our sandwiches. Not a must-visit, but a nice hole in the wall if you are close.",
