    "This place was a quick 5 minute walk from where we were staying. I'm from NY and I know pizza and this pizza was great. The place is tiny and the staff is incredibly tiny. We got there about 11pm and the place was crowded but we managed to get a seat at the bar.On Wednesday every pie is 7 euro, we each got a pie and a few beers, came out to 22 euro. You get free shots of limoncello after you pay. The bartender was so friendly he even ran out and offered the garbage men passing if they wanted anything to eat or drink.I recommend this place to anyone who wants an authentic, funky, cheap, delicious taste of pizza while in Barcelona. I hope to go back before I leave.",
