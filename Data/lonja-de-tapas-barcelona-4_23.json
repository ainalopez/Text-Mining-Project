    "My favorite tapas spot in Barcelona! First off, the Born area (where it's located) is so quaint and aesthetically interesting that each moment had me in complete awe of the intricate architecture and abundant nooks and crannies that one could get lost in while exploring! The restaurant itself is decorated \u00a0somewhat modern, but still quaint and stylish. The menu was creative (super important while competing with the many tapas restaurants in the area!) and had a wide variety of items. I ordered the tomato and goat cheese salad (a bed of juicy marinated tomato slices with olives, nuts and a delicious balsamic-like sauce, topped with a thick, round slice of goat cheese). So amazing! Among our table of four women, we had a bottle of local white wine (I don't remember the type), crispy chicken, pallela, meatballs, bombas, croquettes, mussels, patatas bravas (the best we'd had in BCN). It was all extremely fresh, full of flavor and cooked perfectly! Also our server was fabulous and adorable. Young, pretty brunette; Ugh I cannot remember her name! Anyway, I loved this place. We ate here twice in a two week period (which says a lot with the large number of places to eat available). The next time I'm in Barcelona, I will come back!",
