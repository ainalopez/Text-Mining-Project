    "Classic deli style family cafe which has been open since 1870. It's a short walk from Las Ramblas and we went here in search of the perfect Crema Catalana. It was very quiet when we arrived and we were seated quickly. The waiters are not the friendliest people in the world and we were left to our own devices for quite sometime so we were unsure if we should order at the counter or wait... Eventually we ordered. The Crema Catalana did not disappoint and my hot chocolate was delicious. Very thick and would have gone down very well with some churros. A must visit for those going to Barcelona.",
