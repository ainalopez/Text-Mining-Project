    "Definitely the place to go if you like mussels. The ambiance is fun, they have indoor and outdoor seating, and have lots of tables large enough for groups. The staff is friendly and I heard many of them speaking English. THE FOOD. They have a large list of differently cooked mussels and other assorted shellfish. We had curry mussels (potentially the best dish I've ever eaten) and for about 10 euros, they bring you 25+ mussels, a great deal by Barcelona standards. Drinks were reasonable, and at the end we had a creme brulee that was absolutely delicious. The location is great, close to multiple metro stations and withing walking distance of Sagrada Familia. I will be returning without a doubt.",
