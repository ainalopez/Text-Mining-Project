    "Just arrived from Paris today and figured we would see what Spain had to offer us for dinner. \u00a0As always, I bumped on Yelp to read reviews and couldn't find anything that caught my eye. \u00a0Our Hotel recommended Jamie Beriestain so my wife and I decided to try it.We were very pleased with the selection of wines offered from the various regions in Europe, we were completely impressed with the food and ambiance. \u00a0Not very often a restaurant can pull it together. \u00a0My wife and I are from Southern California and I must admit, ambiance sets the tone for the evening experience. \u00a0The use of fresh ingredients, perfect seasoning and again offering a dish for every meat lover made this a perfect night for my wife and my children. \u00a0We ordered the Salmon for Appetizers and it was awesome. \u00a0My 8 year old son even asked for seconds...I had the Vegetarian Lasagna, my wife and daughter had the Thai Chicken Noodles, my son had the Bacon Cheese Burger and my two other daughters split the 20+ day dry aged steak. \u00a0Everything was presented and prepared perfectly. \u00a0BTW we covered the pork with the prosciutto poppers before dinner. \u00a0If i'm not mistaken, I think we covered all meat and veggie categories tonight.I also found out that Jamie is an interior designer and connected a storefront to his restaurant. \u00a0I must admit, that was pretty clever. \u00a0Nice work Jaime. \u00a0I wish you much success with your businesses. \u00a0I have been to alot of swanky places and I have never seen that done before. \u00a0 I scored 4 out of 5 because one dish was 7 minutes late and we had to beg for our check - Twice! \u00a0 Outside of those two issues, the service was fantastic.",
