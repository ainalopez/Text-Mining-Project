    "Great stop for a lunch bite between walking until our feet hurt and the Museu Picasso. Staff was very friendly, told us what each item was (in English if you wanted) and gladly gave us recommendations on wine. They give you a plate, you grab what you want and pay by the toothpick. Found everything we tried to be delicious and fresh. Fish also, especially the tuna in the red pepper. Try the Basque white wine Txakol\u00ed, kind of like a crisp Sauv Blanc with a little effervescence. \u00a0Sat at the bar and enjoyed watching others pick out their food and cheaper than a table outside. Only downfall was when they kept stopping behind us with plates of hot tapas, the micro hamburger was delicious, croqueta with blueberry jam on top was killer as was the spinach queso pinxto. 11 toothpicks and 4 glasses of wine and being full for \u20ac36-no regrets! Only minor complaint is they serve the Rioja chilled, which is apparently traditional, so had to warm it up to enjoy.",
