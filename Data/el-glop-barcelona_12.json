    "Great Little neighbourhood spot. Easy 15-20 min downhill walk from Park Guell. Had the Pork Sausage and Arugula Salad as appetizers and finished with Seafood Paella. More than enough food for two people - we left quite full (still enough room for dessert). Food is authentic and tasty. Paella can be hit and miss and this was a bullseye. Wouldn't think twice about recommending the restaurant to any friends visiting the city.",
