    "Milk is a MUST for breakfast/brunch if you are in Barcelona! \u00a0Their food is exceptional (particularly if you like American style breakfasts), and their service is sweet, helpful, attentive and kind. \u00a0 Milk was without a doubt the BEST breakfast/brunch place we found in all of Spain. \u00a0Decor is cute, and the music is classic 60s/70s/80s Americana. \u00a0The food is big and tasty...great dishes included pancakes, French toast, eggs benedict with salmon, and their breakfast burger...each of which were sensational. \u00a0And they had some of the best coffee we tasted in all of Barcelona...great stuff! For those tired of the simple pastry and cafe con leche...give Milk a try!",
