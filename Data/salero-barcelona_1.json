    "The ambiance here is wonderful, great place for a romantic dinner. I had the hamburger with brie cheese and potatoes, it was like a deconstructed burger of awesomeness. I also had the burrata salad which was amazing. I've fallen in love burrata it's a mozzarella and cream cheese that literally melts in your mouth. My partner had the duck wrap, similar to large egg roll, this dish was also very well made. Give this place a try you won't regret it. We did not make reservations walked in and they had available seating for two. If you have a large party I would recommend making reservations in advance.",
