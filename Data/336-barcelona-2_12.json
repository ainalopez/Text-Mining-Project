    "Blown away by great food and service. Traveling on a business/fun trip we got so very lucky to find 336. We made a reservation through Yelp 2 weeks in advance and when we got to the restaurant they were ready for our party of 8 and all smiles. Since this was a business trip (with wives and a couple of my biz partner's teenage sons) we had been going pretty big on our meals and frankly had tapa'd out, we were craving a good solid meal. I went a bit overboard and got a perfectly cooked 1 kilo (yes 2.3lb) rib eye steak. I also had the best Caesar salad I have ever had, serious fresh anchovies some Iberian jamone and just the best cheese. My wife got an amazing caprese salad and chicken. Both of my business partners got New York steaks. Not sure what everyone else had??We had great service and a few bottles of Spanish wine that the owner (not sure) recommended. We also had 7 deserts. Again, by far the best meal we had in Barcelona. I can't say enough. I believe our total bill including two $22 euro bottles of wine was $168 euros. Such a bargain for the quality.",
