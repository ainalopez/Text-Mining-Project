    "OutstandingFor something that was recommended in a guide book, i was blown away. I expected average food with some international twist. Instead i got an amazing meal, a quiet table, service when i needed it and all at a reasonable price.Just some of the highlights:A duo of cold soups, gazpacho and a carrot puree to die for.Foie gras and a poached egg that i will never ever get in san franciscoAnd a duck leg that just melted off the bone.Great wine list, a glass of tokay and some real crema catalan to top it all off.Yes, get there early, we snagged the last table at 8:30 (unfashionably early) or just make a reservation.Eat, enjoy, and go back again",
