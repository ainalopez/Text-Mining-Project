    "We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching craft cocktails being made. \u00a0We shared the smoked anchovies on artisanal bread with tomatoes, King prawns and asparagus with parmesan fondue (which had a light foam-like texture) and squid on a chorizo with vermicelli bed. \u00a0The food, service and ambiance were excellent.",
