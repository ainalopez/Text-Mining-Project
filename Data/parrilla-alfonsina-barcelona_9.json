    "The food was fantastic. The reason I gave 4 out of 5 was because of the service. Our waitress was great. The other waiter was very rude and dirty. He had a very bad attitude towards us for some reason. Throughout the meal I saw him sneeze into his hands, pick his nose, and run his fingers through his hair multiple times. And never once washed his hands. Gross. Besides that the filet was fantastic and the sangria was very good.",
