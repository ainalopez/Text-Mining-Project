    "Excellent place to eat after visiting La Pedrera/Casa Battlo area.The servers are a bit cocky but don't take it too personally, it is just comes with the \"flavor\" of any trendy restaurant. The food quality is very good. I really enjoyed their patatas bravas, pan con tomato and anything done with salmon. We ordered about 4 different salmon tapas and they all were excellent. The chipirones fritos are also good. Paco Meralgo has a great wine selection and the suggestions from the server were appropriate for our meal. Keep calm and eat away.",
