    "The falafel here is excellent. About 12 bar stools to sit on, pretty small place but don't let that fool you. We actually went here twice and was thinking of going back for a third time. After all the meat, this was a welcoming change. Do not pass up on the potato fries either. For a restaurant 30 secs away from La Rambla, the prices were very reasonable.",
