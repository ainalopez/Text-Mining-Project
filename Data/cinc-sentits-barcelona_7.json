    "Ugh, I hate to do this because it seems like everyone else loved this place. \u00a0This was our really pricey meal in Barcelona. \u00a0We had high hopes, but I don't think overly-high. \u00a0The place was lovely and the service amazing. \u00a0I thought the food was underwhelming though. \u00a0I know their thing is the sweet/salty balance of senses, but some of the dishes were just too sweet. \u00a0I really wasn't impressed with anything except the pea soup and the entree. \u00a0The desserts were very lackluster. \u00a0I felt horrible because I convinced my husband we should spend the money on this meal and afterwards I wanted to cry because it did feel like a total waste. \u00a0We had much better meals at places that were much cheaper in both Barcelona and Madrid.I've spent more on meals in the US, but never felt disappointed after doing so. \u00a0I wouldn't recommend it.",
