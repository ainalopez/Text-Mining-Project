    "I can attribute my newfound taste for olives to Jai-Ca. Honestly, there may have been some magic abrewin' here, because I literally hated olives before Barcelona. Before Jai-Ca in particular. As a little snack while waiting for my food, I said what the hell and popped one of those puppies in my mouth, and something happened! I liked it!Ok, olives aside, my tapas were great too. I'm a big fan of a tasty croquette, so I had a few of those and a few glasses of wine. The only thing that could have made my experience better would have been wi-fi (they don't have it) and if I could speak Spanish. Our communication was limited to pointing, bad Spanish attempts and hand gestures. So there's that...speak Spanish or be prepared to improvise.",
