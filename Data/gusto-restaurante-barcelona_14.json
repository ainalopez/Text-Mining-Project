    "The other Yelpers who have anything negative to say about the food clearly have never been to Napoli. My family is from Mondragone and I have eaten at some of the best Neapolitan pizzarias in Naples. Gusto is truly authentic Neapolitan pizza. The taste of the wood fired oven, the fresh yet simple ingredients for the dough, quality Mozzarella, and delicious tomato sauce. Since my family comes from a part of Italy where Mozzerella di Bufala is made best, I'm well aware of what authentic should taste like. I live in the states (Boston) and we have absolutely nothing that comes close in quality or flavor. If you have never been to Naples and enjoyed a pizza and you find yourself in Barcelona...GO TO GUSTO. The owners were very friendly, hospitable, and the wait staff had our food in front of us in no time. My wife isn't italian and doesn't like pizza and even she was sold. I bought a pizza for the road to eat after a night of partying in beautiful Barcelona. Everyone said goodbye when we left, like we were part of the family. If you get the chance, go here. You won't be disappointed.",
