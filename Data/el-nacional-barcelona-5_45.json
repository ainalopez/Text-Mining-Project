    "It's definitely an 'in' place right now and was buzzing with people during my one visit. \u00a0Without a reservation, I had to wait for 50 minutes for a table for one at the meat restaurant. \u00a0But what a place to have to wait! \u00a0Multiple cuisines and bars to choose from, all with super views of the people and the space. \u00a0I had a simple solomillio at the steak place with the house red and a dark chocolate ice cream for desert and it was HEAVEN. \u00a0Service is a little slow but, given the crowds, it was understandable. \u00a0Definitely worth a visit to see if it's your thing.",
