    "Great little place in a quiet area of el gotic. We stopped in about 5:30pm for a drink and we're almost the only people there. The staff were really friendly and suggested great wines to go with a few light tapas. We had croquette, anchovies, bread and olives. All were good and with well matched wine. We also got some suggestions for where to find paella - the waitress was very helpful.",
