    "Rating is based solely on the bar - we didn't eat there. Went on a Tuesday night around 11:30, (World Cup Brazil v Germany game had just ended), and it was a really fun atmosphere. Drinks were really good and really strong. They have a variety of mixed concoctions, some served in large milk bottles and topped with whipped cream. I stuck to a mojito, which was perfectly minty, sweet, fizzy, and full of liquor all at once. Seemed like a late night spot as it got really packed around 12:30/1:00. Not a lot of room for dancing but people did anyway. Bartenders were really friendly, and the crowd was eclectic, in a good way. A bit of tourists as well as neighborhood locals.",
