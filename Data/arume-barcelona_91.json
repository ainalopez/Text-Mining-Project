    "Best meal we had in barcelona! Wish we didn't have tapas beforehand so we could have eaten more. We started off sharing one blackberry mojito, then discovered it was so good we ordered 2 more! One of the best mojitos ever made with blackberry vodka, very minty and the best part...sweet pomegranate seeds (vs. tart). The black volcano rice had an amazing flavor profile, with seafood and truffle like qualities. It even had dish Japanese fish flakes on the top to provide texture and more taste. The octopus appetizer was quite delicious and tender, white unique cornstarch like batter though the potato paste below wasn't anything to rave about. Excellent, artisanal food and a must try!",
