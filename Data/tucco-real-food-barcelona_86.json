    "I am a world traveler. I'm always looking for good, fresh food. This restaurant delivers! It's not fancy, but the vegetable lasagna is fabulous! The employees are very helpful. For 8 euros you get a drink, vegetable lasagna, and dessert or coffee. Worth trying to find this place. I'll be back!!!",
