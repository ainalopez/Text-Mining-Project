    "My husband and I came here after exploring the Sagrada Familia about a week ago. One of the ladies speaks a little English, but we were able to communicate by pointing at the food we wanted and it was all good. We got the Calamari, Muscles, and Prawns. IT WAS DELICIOUS. The food was cooked perfectly and very fresh. A good find near a very touristy area, but worth it! It is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.",
