    "The food was okay.I had the croquettes, one spinach, one pumpkin and one funghi, the presentation was so boring, but luckly the taste was alright.Rose to drink was good.A coconut cake I had, was suprisingly good. I say \"suprisingly\", because I'm not much of a cake person, let alone a coconut \u00a0person.I thought the service was incredibly flat! Yes, the staff were polite, but totally just going through the motions. Staff were racing around the restaurant \u00a0at 100 miles a minute, while costumers seemed calm and collective. There was almost like a nervousness \u00a0in the air. Lol, what's going on?!I had 3 wait staff, and it was just me....The place is super cute, \u00a0so kudos for that.",
