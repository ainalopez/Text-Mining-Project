    "We missed the food because we got here at 1.15am. \u00a0The place is open from 1pm to 1am and kitchen closes at 12am. \u00a0So just writing so that no one else misses the place because of the incorrect times. \u00a0Place is cute and the bartender gave us free drinks because we missed the kitchen and walked a long way to check out the place.Update after we ate: \u00a0food was okay. \u00a0Asparagus was great especially with the sauce. \u00a0Shrimp and sun dried tomatoes were okay. Tandoori chicken wings were good.",
