    "Good fresh food but a far cry from authentic Mexican food. I had the taco plate tasty but not Mexican. I'm from California and I've travel extensively to Mexico plus I grew up eating at Mexican friends homes so maybe I'm spoiled with authentic Mexican food. The cochinita pibil needs a kick of spice. The chicken is plain and they really need to get some Clamato for the micheladas pronto! Overall a good experience but not what I expect from a Mexican restaurant. My boyfriend had the arrachera he seem to be please with the plate but unhappy with the beans and lack of tortillas. Again good tasting food but not Mexican.",
