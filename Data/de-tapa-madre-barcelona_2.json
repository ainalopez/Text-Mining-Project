    "Local tapas place that was quick and friendly. \u00a0Everything we ordered was good with the neighborhood flair. \u00a0Nothing too spectacular but of course was above average as Spanish tapas don't disappoint.Apparently a hot spot for tourists as we saw several Japanese tables with a guidebook.",
