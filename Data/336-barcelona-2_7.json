    "Such a fun dining experience! \u00a0 We had a wonderful time dining with 336 during our visit in Barcelona. The staff, food and atmosphere were all great. \u00a0I opted for the pre-fix menu-- 27 euro which includes starter, main and dessert along with a glass of wine. \u00a0It offers you choices without being overwhelmed with decisions and spending a ton of money. \u00a0I had mussels, lamb shoulder and the Catalonian cream to finish--all great choices. \u00a0My husband opted for the Caprese salad to start and then the steak. \u00a0The staff presented his steak in addition to a hot rock so he could continue cooking the steak to his liking. \u00a0After about 10 minutes they swapped the rock and we were good to go again. The portions were perfect, not too much and yet you didn't walk away hungry. \u00a0The prices on the food and wine were about average. \u00a0Presentation was fun without being out of control and intrusive of the taste--over a great dining experience. 336 is an easy to find location about 5 minutes from the main drag.",
