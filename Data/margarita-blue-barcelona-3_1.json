    "1 star for good drinks, however it is a discraise to call the food at this place mexican food. The guacamole is the kind you buy at the supermarket in plastic packs; green synthetic tasteless mass, the burrito where made solely with beans. No sauces, no meat, no taste, no nothing, just a pointless filling.I am not sure how this restaurant even came up with the concept mexican when obviosly being so far away from the knowledge needed to serve mexican food.My advice, go here for drinks, yes, not the food.",
