    "Great restaurant! My wife and I stumbled across this place while looking for a Natura store. I'm glad we did because I waa famished and the foods were very good and healthy. We started with the Red Quinoa Chicken Salad and the homemade watermelon lemonade. Both really good! And then we had the whole grain shrimp pasta which was delicious as well. The portions were a little smaller but that just means you need to order more. You should go if you are in the neighborhood. The server waa very polite and friendly explaining what is good.",
