    "The food was very creative and really excellent, the best we had in Barcelona. \u00a0We did the tasting menu, which gave us a sampling of all of the chef's specialties. \u00a0The food all has an Asian and French bent to it but it's hard to pin down exactly what category it belongs to. \u00a0One of their specialties, a dish of tuna sashimi with a rich, salty sauce and surprisingly mild wasabi ice cream was a highlight. \u00a0We didn't have anything that wasn't top notch.",
