    "Although they do have a few tricks up their sleeves (how DID they get those truffle slices into their poached egg?), most of what they achieve is with simple and precise execution of fantastic and fresh ingredients.For example, on the day we dined, we were graced with being present for the brief season of chipirones (baby squid) and deep fried chanquetes (a rare and highly prized transparent goby) that were paired beautifully with asparagus and broken duck eggs, respectively. \u00a0No bells, no whistles: just beautifully fresh product, well executed and thoughtfully paired.The glazed beef cheek is a more regular feature, and one I would highly recommend. \u00a0Not only is the wine-marinated beef cheek braised for several hours to exquisite tenderness, this is the only time I have been served such a large piece, pretty much the size of a hockey puck (but far more delicious, of course).Another unapologetically decadent dish is their truffle-stuffed poached egg with seared foie gras served on wild mushrooms. \u00a0The combination of the perfectly runny yolk mixing in with the full flavoured mushrooms is just tremendous alongside the perfectly seared piece of foie, and accented beautifully with the pieces of truffle hidden just beneath the surface of the poached egg.Add all this to a pitcher of sangria, their marvelous \"aerated\" and cinnamon-laced version of Creme Catalan, and their ever welcoming front of house Brit (by way of North Africa and France), and you get a fantastic dining experience that is worth repeating, if not to only try everything else on the menu, but to experience your favourites just one more time.",
