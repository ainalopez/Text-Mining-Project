    "Best place to eat and experience! If I came to Barcelona and ate at this place, I would be able to go home happily.The boyfriend and I took a last minute trip to Barcelona and therefore couldn't make many reservations, let alone for Tickets since you need at LEAST 60 days of advanced notice to make a reservation here. However, we were informed that if we came at 7PM (we arrived a little earlier, which is highly recommended) and waited in line, we would be able to take last minute reservation cancellations. We were the last \"party\" that was able to take a canceled reservation. We were overjoyed!It was my first time trying a tapas tasting menu, and it was so exciting to not know what kind of food you're going to get. It was more enjoyable that every tapas we got was so good! And it wasn't just the food, but the waitress instructed us on the best way to eat the tapas to get the flavors right. We had their (infamous) olivas gordal adobada & olivas verdial, pulpito al azafran, xuxi de semilla de tomate y anchoas. mini airbags de ques. huevo de codorniz en \"nest\", ensalada tomate, majado aguacate, ostra consome de melon, mejillones marinera, fritura de peix, patatas confitadas, mollete papada, pollo yauarcan, xuxi queso payoyo, gusanitos, roca volcanica, palet d'or, and these ice cream cupcakes that I didn't catch the name of. We definitely wanted more, but our time slot was only 2 hours long. Haha.It was definitely on the pricey side, but it was completely worth it. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. The food was fun and tasteful and makes me yearn for more of Ferran Adria's food and/or influences.",
