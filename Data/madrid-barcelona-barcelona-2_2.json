    "Just visited on the basis of a friends suggestion. The lamb with garlic was excellent. Full of flavour and dropping off the bone. I think the general cusine is Spanish country food, excellently done, and at an unbelievable price. Feels like this restaurant has been here for 100 years, and will be around for 100 more. This one is a keeper.",
