    "I was so upset that I only came here in the last couple of weeks of my time in Barcelona. \u00a0They make their own cava, and it's mad barato. \u00a0Their sandwiches are gooey and delicious and messy. \u00a0The only problem I had with this place is that there's no real place to sit and you have to pretty much yell your order out when you get the chance, as it's a mad house.",
