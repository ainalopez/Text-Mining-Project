    "As I expected, it is a Japanese run by chinese. No biggy, but if you are looking for a huge selection of sushi, sashimi and maki, this is not your place. The staff is kind and fast. There is always a line, so expect a 20 min delay. If you are looking to sit nearby the food carrousel, make sure you are less than 3, because it is difficult to get an spot there. We finally had to go to a table after 30 min of waiting for the table with the food carrousel, we were 4. The service on the table was fast and we had enough food, but the only fish served on the sushi menu was salmon, that I think is a kind of lame for someone that calls himself a sushi bar. Most of the plates were chinese, and I will say that the duck was good, but is not what I am looking when I am craving for sushi. In summary, go there if you want huges amounts of food with some sushi here and there. Don't go there if you are looking for sushi",
