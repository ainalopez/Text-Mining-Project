    "Rosa Negra is both a great bar, and a great restaurant. The food is cheap, authentic and delicious and the service is extremely fast. Most dishes, especially the tacos and quesadillas come extremely fast. The drinks are amazing, and at 3.50 for a mojito or margarita, ridiculously cheap. The place is always crowded- especially at night, when most people just stand around drinking by the bar. Sometimes it's quite hard to get a table, especially at around 10/11pm- dinner time. If you're one of those people who only seeks to see the \"real\" Barcelona, and desperately wishes to avoid foreign students and expats, Rosa Negra is not for you. While it is also frequented by locals, you'll also find a lot of Americans and internationals here.Overall, Rosa Negra is a great place with great Mexican food, and delicious Margaritas.",
