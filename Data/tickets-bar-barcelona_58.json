    "So far best meal in Barcelona! \u00a0We have reservations at 41 degrees in a few days so will have to post on that soon! \u00a0Got reservations for lunch and we were seated at the counter in front of the kitchen. \u00a0We started off with the olives, which were incredible! \u00a0I don't think I can go back to eating regular olives again. \u00a0Everything was spectacular (although I could do without the mini airbags of manchego) but the oysters with suquet (Catalan fish broth) and the razor clams particularly amazing. \u00a0The tomato tartar and tuna belly were also delicious and unique.Service was extremely attentive and the little ice cream cart was quite charming! \u00a0Prices were reasonable, for 10 dishes, bottle of cava, beers, coffee and dessert around 115 euros! \u00a0We left stuffed, happy and drunk!",
