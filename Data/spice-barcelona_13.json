    "This has been repeated so many times, but it\u00b4s the truth: CARROT CAKE. All their slices are pretty big, and my friends have gotten different cakes, such as their cheesecake and chocolate cake. Their service is wonderful, and they speak very good english, so no worries if you have bad Spanish like me. It\u00b4s also a good place to study, but it is a little smalll, so don\u00b4t expect your own table. If the cafe is full, don\u00b4t let that deter you from getting something to go! It\u00b4s well worth it.",
