    "A little bit of Mazzy Star, Mos Def, M83, Muse.... wait a minute... Milk.... bands that start with the letter M... hmmmm... curious. \u00a0I'm just realizing this as I write this. \u00a0Ha ha. \u00a0I should have called them on that! \u00a0Anywho... it was a nice mix of genres on the playlist they had goin' on in the little joint. \u00a0It's a comfortable little nook with some hipster feel to their decor. \u00a0I was diggin it. \u00a0It was clean and comfy. \u00a0Oh, you can check out pics of the place on their website.As for the food... my little crew and I decided to break up the inevitable tapas fest and threw in some western fare for dinner. \u00a0We all ended up getting burgers. \u00a0And they did not disappoint! \u00a0I had the BB deluxe... i think it was called. \u00a0The burger was a bit dry, but the sauteed onions totally made up for it. \u00a0And with the Spanish ketchup being just a bit different than what I'm used to... a little sweeter... it made for a great Spanish take on an American classic! \u00a0Good music, good food, good friends... all made for a great meal!Oh almost forgot. \u00a0The menu has both Spanish and English so it was very easy to peruse the menu. \u00a0And the really friendly waiter also spoke perfect English... and I must say... sounded a lot like Johnny Depp!.",
