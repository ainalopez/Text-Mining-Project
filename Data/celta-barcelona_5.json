    "Came here on the recommendation of her air B&B host for late tapas. Their wine recommendation was really good and we drank a whole bottle of house red quickly. We ordered a few things wanting to try a variety but they only ended up bringing out three of the four. This place is a little tough for tourists because there aren't really table menus so you have to know what the items on their counter are. Plate of croquettes was decent. Potatoes brothers were okay, but the pulp octopus was really good for me. Very tender, big pieces-friend had a hard time getting past the suction cups but I thought it was very good.So good wine, good octopus, not ideal for tourist tapas destination.",
