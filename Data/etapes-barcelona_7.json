    "I decided to visit Etapes both because the guy at the front desk recommended it and Yelp reviews, especially for paella, were really good. And it's lived up to its hype! I'll be going again tomorrow. Service great and so was the food and drink. I had paella, of course, and sangria, of course. Very intimate, many locals, and great ambiance as well.",
