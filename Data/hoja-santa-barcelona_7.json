    "This was one of the greatest meals of my life. We did the tasting and every course was interesting, delicious and beautiful like a work of art. The staff was friendly and attentive without being stuffy. Service was perfect. Thus place is on par with Benu in SAn Francisco but an amazing value. If you are not yet convinced, we were seated near Top Chef Masters winner Rick Bayless and his family. This is a must in Barcelona.",
