    "my friends and i were just looking for a nice restaurant to stop by in for lunch, at first la fonda seemed like the perfect spot. first impressions were okay, far prices, nice and clean atmosphere.. we had picked out our food and were ready to order and that is where it all went downhill from there. getting the waiters attention required much more work than needed, for usually its their job to check on their customers. and then a closer look at our glasses, we had some soap and water scum on it. the outside and somewhat overall appearance gave us false hope. we did not worry too much about the dirty dishes, for then we just brushed it off and decided to wipe it with our napkins and there, done and over - no problem. then there were just so many other things that just led to an overall HORRIBLE experience. they brought out the soup.. without any spoons.. and could not get their attention (even though we were raising our hands up higher than a second grader wanting to get picked for line leader, called \"WAITER WAITER\" numerous times, and once we did get the attention of one, they refused to help us because they weren't their table and then said they'd get our waiter EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDNT).. didn't seem to check up on us.. and the same process of trying to get our waiters attention for our checks occurred. OVERALL the food, look, and atmosphere of it was okay.. it was the POOR, TERRIBLE service that landed la fonda the ONE STAR. would not return even if the food was free.",
