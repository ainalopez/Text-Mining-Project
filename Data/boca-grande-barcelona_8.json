    "Well on the pricey side, frequented by a mix of people but noticeable by the bold and the beautiful...Staff is of a very high calibre, attentive, quick react, efficient and friendly with a twinkle in the eye.Had a quick dinner on the counter, opposite an interesting display of iced fish and live crabs in their death-throes... Ink tagliatelle and cod were very creamy/greasy but also on par with the price.",
