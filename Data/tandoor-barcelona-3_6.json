    "Crap food. Even crappier service. Disagree with the five stars given by Samantha cause me thinks she has never had a proper Indian meal. The meat was particularly below par. Worst part: the waiter didn't bother to change our cutlery between courses; he actually just left the dirty ones back on the table ! gross.",
