    "Just an awesome night! \u00a0Great neighborhood, perfect Barcelona experience at Pitarra. \u00a0The owner, James (Jaume, Jaime) gave us a night we'll never forget...even though I don't remember leaving. \u00a0Fantastic Paella, Cava, Cuban cigars. \u00a0I can't recommend this enough, don't be fooled by the conservative decor or clientele, it's a fun time to be had.",
