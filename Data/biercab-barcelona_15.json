    "At first this place was not what I expected. We went at 10pm on a Saturday night and the place was virtually empty, maybe because it was the night of the Barcelona championships game and there are no televisions at the place. It was very small, smaller than it looks like on Yelp. The staff was friendly and they had 29 beers on tap. Beers were between 3.50 euro-7 euro. We stayed there for about two hours, had a few beers and got the potatoes bravas that were spicy but excellent. There is free wifi here, but it is a bit slow. Again, this is kind of a tourista spot, but its a cool place with great beers if you are looking to drink nice beers and have some chill time. But, by no means is this a crazy, bar/pub with late hours and a crazy crowd, they close at midnight.",
