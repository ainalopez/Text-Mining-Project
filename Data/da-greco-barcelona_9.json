    "I have been to many great Italian restaurants and Da Greco definitely does this in the food department, however I felt it was trying to be something it's not. Right away you can tell the service does not do it justice and the ambiance is just awful. The room was so lit up that when my girlfriend and I walked into the restaurant it felt that everyone was staring at us and the tables were so close to each other I felt everyone was listening to our conversation. I really enjoyed the chef's Lobster special and the three course pasta was good, but I felt the restaurant was lacking in service which really caused me to give this a 3 star rating. Definitely look elsewhere...",
