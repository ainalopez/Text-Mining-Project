    "Being right on the main street in the El Born area, I was skeptical about the quality of food [I prefer hidden gems with minimal tourists], but we couldn't pass up the sidewalk tables and the exuberant conversations of locals nearby helped put my mind at ease. If locals eat here, it must be good right? Right! We ordered a few dishes...the patatas fritas, a ham and egg dish, and a really yummy spicy shrimp dish that came out in a sizzling skillet. The coffee was good too. Great place for small eats and people watching!",
