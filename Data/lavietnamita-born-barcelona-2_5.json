    "It's the second time I visit this place and I enjoyed it even more than the first time! The food is fresh and the taste is amazing. What I didn't like is the system: u have to fill in a form, place your order there and pay at the entrance before having the food. The inconvenience there for me is: what if there's something wrong with the food? In a normal restaurant if there's anything wrong with the food, you don't pay it (not that it should be wrong ever, but still) or if you wanted to have another drink, u have to stand up, fill in the form (make the queue...). Staff is fine - could be a little nicer tbh, and the service is really fast when it's not completely packed with people: my friend was still ordering his food and they were calling my name to go get the food. + points for that! Finally, what I like also is that they have a day specialty for curry and bun which changes everyday (yeah, that's why it's called daily specialty lol) and so if you have tasted many things in the menu, there's always something different! Enjoy :)",
