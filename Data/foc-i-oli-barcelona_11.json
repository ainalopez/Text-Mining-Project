    "Myself and 2 other friends were starving after walking around barcelona for quite sometime and ended up here. It's quite small, but they make up for it with their deliscious sandwiches. I thinks my sandwich and beer was 8euro. so it was extremely affordable and the food came out quick...it was none of that 3 hour long dining that many folks are used to around barcelona. It felt like we were in someone's personal kitchen. They even spoke a little english to explain the menu and make small talk. They loved that we came all the way from Texas. You won't be dissappointed by grabbing a quick bite here.",
