    "We stayed in Barcelona earlier this week. We came to Sensi Bistro after reading Yelp's review . We were a large group .The waitress offered to pick their best tapas for us. Although the service was good, the food was very mediocre .The cod tasted somewhat fishy. The pork had a weird after taste . And the beef was overcooked, and chewy. Don't think that we will go back !!",
