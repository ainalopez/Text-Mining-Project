    "Great place. \u00a0Hot in Barcelona right now (no matter where you are). \u00a0Very untypical spanish waitress in Monica. \u00a0Dealt with five kids (table of 8) with class, great recommendations with an incredibly diverse menu. \u00a0Penne bolognese, burger (no bun), shrimp tagliatelle, salad with cheese, etc excellent. \u00a0Hit of the the night was porc iberique Carbone...intimidating to order but always go with waitress. \u00a0Fall off the bone pork ribs were incredible, washed down with maisulan Rioja. \u00a0Dessert included chocolate cake and ice cream that were both muy tasty. \u00a0For a casual outdoor dinner with kids (sat at 9pm); can't say enough good things.",
