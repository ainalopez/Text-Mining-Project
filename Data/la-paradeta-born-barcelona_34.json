    "This place was AMAAAAZING. Loved it!Came here on a Wed night at around 930 and so missed out on the craziness I had read about prior. Waited in line for less than 10 minutes which was necessary since we had a hard time deciding what we wanted.Upon entering, you are greeted by a huge display of freshly caught seafood. They had clams, lobster, shrimp, fish, mussels.... everything! You pick what items you want, how much of it you want (charged by weight), and how you'd like it cooked. The guy prepping everything will usually tell you the options. We ended up getting the giant shrimp grilled, mussels in marinara, big squid grilled, and oysters raw on the half shell. Once you pick your seafood items, you go around the corner and get drinks, salads, breads, etc if you want. They give you a number and you sit down anywhere and let the drooling begin! There are two small windows that look into the kitchen and from which your food is served (and your dirty plates are taken). All food goes out as ready so don't expect to have everything at the same time.All of our food was DELICIOUS and full of flavor. The prep is super straight forward so the ingredients really shine. Despite getting an awkwardly green oyster, everything was \u00a0fantastic. Our favorite was the grilled shrimp which thinking about now makes me wish I was back in spain.All of that food for two people who love to eat came out to ~35 euros. Great deal!",
