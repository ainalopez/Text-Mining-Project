    "Mayura offers great Indian food in a great contemporary and comfortable atmosphere. \u00a0I tried the chicken tikka masala and chicken korma. \u00a0Both very yummy. \u00a0The portions were just the right size to leave you stuffed as you walk out if you have had an appetizer and entree. \u00a0They have an extensive and interesting drink menu, but I had my meal with a couple mango lassis. \u00a0 As far as price, I think it is a good value for what you get.One thing that also stands out from other Barcelona restaurants is the decor. It is nicely appointed in a comfortable atmosphere. There is a mix of contemporary and traditional. I highly recommend. In fact, I visited the restaurant twice during my last trip to Barcelona.",
