    "This place is the bomb.com/amazing lol. We ordered the tapas shrimp chichiron , tapas tuna belly, duck salad, burrata pizza and mozzarella and fresh ham pizza. Mouth watering! And to end it with a melt in your mouth moist brownie. I love to bake and am picky with my desserts. My brownies have been one of the best and they have topped me.",
