    "This place is wonderful. It has this very warm and inviting feeling, while still being incredibly chic. \u00a0The food is amazing and they offer a meal for 9.5 where you can choose your appetizer and entree from a list of plates they serve for the day. As an added bonus they also have free wifi.My only recommendation is to come early for the day deal, when I went they \u00a0were running out of things pretty quickly.",
