    "This is a very popular place to eat with locals and tourists. Love that there isn't really a menu. The happy owner smiles and says, \"meat? Or meat?\" I respond, \"meat!\" He serves us meat, croquettes, garbanzo beans and some other stuff. The food is great but it does add up. You may have to wait awhile to get a stool but it's a fun experience eating here. You will see the guy serving you in his bow tie and suspenders alongside a newspaper article framed on the wall of him wearing the same outfit.",
