    "me and justin b. visited pakta after doing some research on the Adria brothers in barcelona. we thought pakta sounded like a really cool concept meshing peruvian and japanese flavors. was really easy to make a reservation on their website. we were seated at the main bar which was awesome to see the chefs cook and plate all the dishes which made me even more excited to try the tasting menu! i opted for the bigger/more expensive machu picchu menu (125 euro). you are served a bunch of small courses that are so beautifully presented to you. the presentation alone for these dishes was amazing. there were so many dishes but some of the standouts to me were the oysters, prawn, nigri, causas, grilled octopus, and gyoza. i didnt love all the dishes and thought some were just ok, but i do have to commend the chefs for their creativity and willingness to take a chance on this different type of menu. even though i opted for the menu with more courses, i didnt feel overly stuffed by the end of the meal either. definitely not a cheap meal but worth a try if you're willing to splurge.",
