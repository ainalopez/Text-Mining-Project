    "I'm so disappointed. I follow this place on instagram and it was one of my must do's in Barcelona but turns out it's all form and no function. The space is lovely and the concept is very \"now\" but the execution is terrible. They say their menu focuses on 80% plant based food and 20% on oily fish, yet their breakfast menu has no oily fish on it. News flash...oily fish is amazing with eggs for brekkie! Speaking of eggs they only have one egg dish on the menu which I ordered. The portion, for \u20ac9, was ridiculously small. The chef absolutely could not have used more than one egg to make the scramble. My boyfriend ordered a gluten free muesli. It was so terrible, mixed with a horrible store bought overly sweet soya yoghurt. \u00a0I make gluten free muesli at home all the time and just because it's gluten free it doesn't have to be uninteresting. Redeeming qualities: nice space, good coffee and friendly staff. I won't be salivating over their instagram feed anymore that's for sure.",
