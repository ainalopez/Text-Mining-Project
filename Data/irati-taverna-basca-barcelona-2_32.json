    "Perhaps a bit expensive BUT worth every penny. \u00a0One of my best meals ever. \u00a0Ordered the Monk fish and it was tops. \u00a0Service was great. \u00a0The Pimientos de gernika were \"super\".Thought we had made a mistake when we walked up but once past the Tapas Bar, the small restaurant was very comfortable and nice.Will be back.",
