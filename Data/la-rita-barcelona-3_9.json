    "We were wandering down the street and saw a queue of Spaniards waiting to fill this restaurant as it opened at 8,00. \u00a0We thought it worth a try on that basis and were really pleased we did. Window seat in a packed but cool eating section which just got more popular as it went on. The patatas bravas and homous starters were just excellent as was the Savingnon Blanc. Main courses varied from fish to steaks and were served quickly so that more customers could be accommodated. We loved this restaurant :)",
