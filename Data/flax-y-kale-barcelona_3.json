    "Omg.... My favorite place in Barcelona. Please go here. It's worth coming to Barcelona just to eat at this restaurant. I ate here twice in 3 days. Wish I could give them more stars. I stuffed myself every time. Best acai bowl I've ever had in my life. Amazing sweet filling and healthy vegan croissant. Great and very creative juices. Amazing healthy kale salad. Fresh and BIG sashimi toast. Could go on and on",
