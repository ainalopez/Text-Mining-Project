    "Not the first pintxo place to visit, unfortunately, but so far the best and most reasonably priced. All pintxos are $1 and the ones with red toothpicks at $1.80. Compare that to the touristy pintxo restaurants where each pintxo is about $2. Slightly dissapointed about the sangria due to the fact that they add extra table sugar at the bottom on the glass. The sangria itself tasted good but as you get closer to the end it gets sweeter and sweeter. Each large glass us $3. The small beer glass is $1.Relatively small bar with few tables. Great atmosphere. Very friendly staff. Delicious pintxos! Worth another trip back or two!",
