    "We grabbed a quick bite while we were walking around the Barri Gotic. There is a pretty good assortment of pinxtos and the food that we had seemed pretty fresh. There was a good assortment of flavors ranging from the ever present bacalao to some dessert pinxtos that were really sweet and delicious. We also split a bottle of txakoli and the price was really good. Good place to stop for a quick bite as you wander around the city.",
