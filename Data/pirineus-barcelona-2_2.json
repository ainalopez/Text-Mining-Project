    "Ended up here a little by accident. We went to Gracia on a Sunday and this was the only place that was open. The people were super friendly and the outside area was great for hanging out. I ordered paella, it was not so great and took 30 minutes (which they warned us about). The rice wasn't fully cooked and was too hard to chew :( Mussels were gritty and gross (didn't eat them) and they included crab legs, but no way to get them open womp womp.My BF got some sort of sausage that he didn't really like either.",
