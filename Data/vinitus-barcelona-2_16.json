    "Found this place really close to hotel and had good reviews on Yelp. Arrived about 2030 without a reservation and place was very busy so did not hold out much hope but we were seated at the bar with him 15 minutes. Service was fantastic throughout. The Rioja was tasty and the food delicious especially the asparagus and mushroom. We also had goats cheese but the delight was the best Spanish omelette we have tasted. Really recommend this place",
