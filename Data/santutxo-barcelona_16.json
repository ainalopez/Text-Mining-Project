    "We went with two friends for lunch and we were all of us kinda disappointed despite the good reviews we read before choosing this place. The chef is very friendly and welcoming, but instead of bragging so much about his place and his food, he should spend more time in his kitchen focused on the dishes and keep his promises to cook only from scratch using fresh ingredients. The pumpkin soup was obviously a dehydrated industrial one, we got ripped off with the hamburgers since there was only the patty in the plate with no buns, cheese, tomato... Moreover the meat was overcooked and of very poor quality, despite the 2.9\u20ac extra you have to pay compared to the set menu. One of my friend took the rabbit and there were twice more bones than edible meat in the dish.... The desserts, apple and chocolate pie didn't increase the level of mediocrity since they were processed and not home made. \u00a0At the end of this disastrous meal, the happy go lucky chef behaviour becomes truly unbearable. He'd rather retrain as a street pedler and withdraw from cuisine forever.",
