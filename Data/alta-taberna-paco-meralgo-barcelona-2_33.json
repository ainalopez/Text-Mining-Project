    "The absolute best tapas I've ever had. Food: 5 starsEverything from start to finish was wonderful. Even though they can be considered 'common' i highly recommend the tomato bread with jamon iberico. Further, I also loved the raw tuna cubes (think poke), and if you can only have one meat dish I highly recommend the steak pieces in garlic. For dessert go for the sampler of small bites, or alternatively go for the Catalan version of creme brulee. \u00a0The latter is also very popular and can be found in a lot of places. Price: 5 starsWe had so much food that we were all stuffed, started with cava (sparkling wine), had red wine and finally coffee with desert, the total bill came to under \u20ac50 per person. Service: 5 starsAttentive with good sense of humor. Atmosphere: 4 starsHip, modern, a little loud. Smallish but cozy. Overall, a definite must if you are in Barcelona. Make advanced reservation and if you can come with friends so that you get to sample a lot of food!",
