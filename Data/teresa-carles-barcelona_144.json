    "After eating a lot of meat, I really wanted vegetables. I convinced my husband that we should try this place out and I'm so glad we did! \u00a0The juices were fresh and delicious. \u00a0For dinner we shared a large cesar salad and a vegetable risotto. \u00a0Both were delicious and the portions were perfect for us. I wish we had room to try out one of their desserts though. \u00a0 The ambiance here is trendy and green. \u00a0They have free wifi!",
