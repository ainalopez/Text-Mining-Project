    "This brand new business is the kind of place that puts a smile on my face when I'm visiting Barcelona.\u00a1No hay solo 'caf\u00e9 con leche' aqu\u00ed!Fantastic coffee from a super friendly barista, the usual Monocle magazines and background music while you sip your beverage and a selection of tiny tasty bites para postres.Despite all the evidence, I still maintain that I'm not a coffee snob, but if i *were* one, I'd be more than happy to recommend this place to my fellow coffee snobs.",
