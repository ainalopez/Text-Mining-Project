    "My friend and I went out of our way to find the best Thai place in Barcelona. \u00a0This was the third place we tried, and the only one we went back to (and by far, the best AND the most reasonable). \u00a0The red curry is their best curry, and is absolutely perfect. \u00a0Green was also great. \u00a0The fried rice was very mediocre, and was a let-down, but we didn't make that mistake twice. \u00a0We saw a couple having the pad thai, and it did look very good. \u00a0In fact, most of what we saw at other tables looked amazing. \u00a0But we're curry fanatics. \u00a0The staff is also very pleasant, attentive, and not pushy at all. \u00a0The area that this place is in is very nice too, and right off of Gracia, near Diagonal. \u00a0Very nice area to walk around in, day or evening. \u00a0Kinda like the Fifth Avenue (and 57th St.) area in Manhattan. \u00a0If you're in Barcelona, and missing Thai, then this is the place.",
