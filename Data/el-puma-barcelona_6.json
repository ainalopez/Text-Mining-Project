    "For an all you can eat buffet, this place is pretty top notch! \u00a0I'm giving it 5 stars in comparison to other buffet restaurants in Barcelona, Based on food, quality, and service.They had a very impressive selection of food. \u00a0Cuts of meat (prepared on the grill, to order), and they even had things that I don't normally see at buffets. \u00a0They had beef cheeks, and they were SO TENDER!! Paella, fideua, and the salad bar was quite extensive. \u00a0I wish I had enough room in my tummy to sample it all...but I guess that's what return visits are for. \u00a0I went on a discount coupon, for 50% off, so it was completely worth it. \u00a0I think even for 20 euros it's still worth it. \u00a0 The drinks, however were quite expensive. \u00a02.50 for a bottle water or soda.Overall, I enjoyed the food and the staff were very friendly and attentive, and they ccleared plates very quickly. \u00a0I had a really great experience and I know this won't be my last time visiting El Puma",
