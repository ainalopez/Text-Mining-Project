    "First, as an American with high expectations of customer service, this place had the kindest wait staff we experienced on our 2 week trip to Spain.The decor is white table cloth, proper place settings. \u00a0If you wanted to dress up, ehis would be the place to do it. \u00a0If you don't, we saw a locals in very casual clothing here and no one seemed to care.Many have already mentioned this restaurant was featured on Anthony Bourdain - well deserved.Many have also written about the wondrous egg souffle - I couldn't agree more. \u00a0Not only is it beautiful and delicious, I think it defies physics.My husband and I had the 5 course tasting menu. \u00a0The waitress asked if there was anything we do not like. \u00a0I said that I do not like strong seafood. \u00a0She said that she will substitute out the anchovies appetizer for a ham and artichoke salad, but leave in the cod with rice. \u00a0Tasting menu orders had to be the same for all people at the table.First, the Iberian ham and artichoke salad was perfection. \u00a0It was a delicios combination of flavors and delicate textures.Second, the egg souffle was divine. \u00a0My meal could have been done at this point and I would have been perfectly satisfied.Third was the cod. \u00a0I could tell that it was prepared exceptionally. \u00a0very moist, but not greasy. \u00a0The rice had green peas which added a delightful texture. \u00a0My husband liked this dish a lot, but it turns out that cod is not a fish I like.Fourth, was the most adventurous dishes for me: pigeon. \u00a0It looked beautiful and I bravely took a giant bite. \u00a0I was also feeling a bit vengeful because a pigeon had just bombed my head earlier that day at Park Guell.It was good at first, but then a horrid aftertaste set in. \u00a0I don't think it was in my head. \u00a0It was gaminess laced with regret. \u00a0If you don't think you'd like pigeon, don't do it. \u00a0I am however confident that it was the best preparation possible and if I don't like it here, I will not like it anywhere.Last, but not least was dessert. \u00a0Always the way to my heart. \u00a0It wasn't able to compare to the egg souffle, but it was still delicious. \u00a0Warm, chocolate fluffy goodness with cream and some sort of toasted grain that added a wonderful nutty and crunchy accent to the chocolate.If I went back, I'd order the ham salad and egg souffle, maybe the dessert too, and go home happy.",
