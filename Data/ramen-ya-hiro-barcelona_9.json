    "This is one of those places that is authentic, cheap and fun. Packed in on little tables inside, I would recommend sitting at the bar if possible. I am somewhat tall (188cm), so it was a little cosy for me. Seating for three is a little tight as you are squeezed onto the end of a table for 2, with the table for 2 behind you almost hitting you in the back. Staff are friendly and helpful. Had to queue to get a table, but it was worth it. Few people came in solo and sat at the bar. Very cool atmosphere. Only comment on the food was that next time, we would not bother with the extra topping. The food was great as is. Just get a ramen bowl each. There is plenty of food in each serving.",
