    "Amazing food. Amazing service. Visiting from the US our server Paula was able to explain menu items in English and confirmed our choices. The chocolate mousse dessert was excellent, the tuna sashimi on a corn pancake was the best bite of food I have had yet in Spain. Then the mozzarella, leek, truffle, egg pizza took it home. What a great meal.",
