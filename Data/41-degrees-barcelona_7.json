    "A D.C. native going to eat in Spain....it sounds pretty damn good to me!I had to pay for the entire meal at the time of reservations. \u00a0So it was not cheap by any measure and having to pay for the experience before even setting foot into the restaurant is somewhat risky....you really are relying on the reputation of the chef and the establishment. \u00a0Given that this is Ferran and Albert Adria's bar/food pairing concept I guess you get a little less apprehensive to the fact that this is paying for the performance like any good show it builds anticipation.Now I can say add more to what has been said but I can guarantee you one thing you will not leave hungry, and you will not leave unsatisfied with the entire experience! \u00a0Every dish leaves you wanting more and every course leaves you a little bit more melancholy knowing that the end is getting closer than farther away. \u00a0I traveled 7 thousand miles to come eat here(had a layover in amsterdam) and I enjoyed every minute of it, more over it is worth every penny that was paid for it!A little tip, it is hard to get reservations at Tickets the tapas restaurant but if you go for your reseervations at 41 degrees they will pretty much shore up a reservation at tickets for you within a few days after your dining experience. \u00a0I could add pictures and I could comment and geek out on everything that was placed in front of me but all I have to say is that there was a reason that the brothers ran the #1 restaurant in the world and it show in this endeavor! \u00a0Cheers and Enjoy!P.S. the one dish that really stood out for me was the homage to NoMa, the beef carpaccio with spicy pickled carrot was really the best 2 bites of my life....astounding for something so compact to really leave that type of memory from my palate.",
