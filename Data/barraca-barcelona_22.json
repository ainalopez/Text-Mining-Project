    "slightly superior paella to El Suquet de l'Almirall. \u00a0rice a little less al dente, similar flavor, but little less salty. \u00a0cooked a little faster, 2 person minimum thus pricier. \u00a0mussels a little oceany. \u00a0the bread is perfect, so was the burrata salad with arugula and tomato with pesto, excellent. \u00a0calamari fried with tartar also done well.",
