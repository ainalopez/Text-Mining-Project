    "5 stars for service5 stars for setting5 stars for being experimental5 stars for a well-curated menu5 stars for the selection of winesWhat you won't find: \u00a0the standard typical spanish food. and that's a very good thing.What you will find: \u00a0a thoughtfully planned and presented rotating menu with unusual ingredients & combinations. \u00a0Was this the best I've had in Molecular gastronomy? \u00a0No - I've had better.Is Moo for everyone? \u00a0No... Unless you have the budget and want to try something \u00a0completely different.It is very expensive. \u00a0And the portions are small. \u00a0That said, the prices are appropriate considering the whole. \u00a0It is a meal to experience. \u00a0Food as (edible) art. side note - I can't have dairy. \u00a0But these dishes were worth the risk of a breakout... I mean, when am I ever gonna have the chance to pair \"pigeon carpaccio with juniper berry ice cream again???Did I love every bite? \u00a0no. \u00a0some of the items I tried were not to my liking - but I give them credit for the effort.If I were to give a rating based on how much I enjoyed the food, taking away all the external factors, I'd give Moo a 3.5 - good, but not great. \u00a0But as explained above, Moo earned the 5 stars for the whole package. \u00a0I can't deduct a star because the food was not to my personal liking.",
