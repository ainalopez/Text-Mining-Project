    "First you walk in and the place right away gives off a characteristic decor of a place that was not put together by some designer but by a proprietor who loves art! Very eclectic mix of pictures on the wall including a Joan Miro print. We only ordered a la carter as we were too early for the ever touted buffet which starts at 8. The staff was very attentive and recommended almost everything On the menu. We liked the octopus, pork gyoza and the Asian flared steak skirt . We would go back! Our foodie boys say it is their favourite place in Barcelona.",
