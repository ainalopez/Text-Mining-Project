    "Wanted to see what the hype is all about, every time I pass by j see a huge number of people waiting to be seated, and I thought it should be so great. But now I do not know where to start, the food was amazing! The food is all fresh, clean and tasty, not easy to find this quality around the rambla, it is without a doubt worth it. Such a good experience the waiters are all extremely nice.",
