    "A tiny, colorful pizza place not far from the Rambla. The pizzas offered here are very big with thin crust and amazing taste. Big plus that they also offer vegetarian options, the one with sundries tomatoes is mouthwatering.You can of course enjoy the pizza indoors on one of the four bar stools they have been able to fit here, but this is really a takeout spot. At Circus you buy pizza by the slices, so this is a perfect pit stop if you are on the go. Just grab a piece of pizza and keep walking!",
