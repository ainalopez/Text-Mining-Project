    "Very good tapas bar. Very nice and friendly, english speaking staff.Good variation of cold tapas, warm tapas came directly from the kitchen and were offered to the table. You can choose if you want to try or don\u00b4t. But keep the toothpicks!We also had a very delicious wine.Toilets were clean.I can highly recommend this location!",
