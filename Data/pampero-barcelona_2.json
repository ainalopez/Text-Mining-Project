    "My husband and I were on our third day in Barcelona. We have enjoyed numerous restaurants with tapas and Catalon food. We were looking for a change. We found a great one. This restaurant had a wonderful atmosphere, courteous and friendly servers, and most of all delicious food. We both enjoyed the tenderloin with mushroom. Goat cheese salad and grilled and freshly grilled corn. The house recommended Malbec was delicious for 12 euros! We highly recommend this restaurant. Delicious delicious delicious!",
