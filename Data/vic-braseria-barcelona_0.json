    "This place has a great atmosphere. \u00a0Classy, yet down-to-earth. \u00a0My husband and I loved our tuna and rabbit dishes along with wonderful appetizers and dessert. \u00a0The sangria was also outstanding. \u00a0It was definitely busy, so a reservation would be helpful on some nights. \u00a0Extremely helpful for English-speaking folks.",
