    "Really tasty tapas. A bit more expensive than the more traditional places but worth it for a once off. Still reasonable by most European country standards. We shared 5 or 6 plates and that was more than sufficient. \u00a0Only complaint on one of the dishes was the risotto wasn't a risotto, more of a regular rice dish but stoll really tasty. Also it's fast paced in here. \u00a0We were in and out in an hour so don't expect to lounge around. There is a queue out the door and they aren't shy about dropping you the bill before you ask for it.",
