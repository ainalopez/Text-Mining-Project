    "Easily the worst place we went to over 2 weeks in Spain both food and service wise. We figured the paella would be good here because it's by the beach so, we thought the seafood part of the dish would be extra good. My dad was looking forward to trying paella for the first time the whole trip and was severely disappointed. I think it basically scarred him from paella which is a real shame when you're in Spain. We also wanted to get something from the daily menu but they didn't have them in English..we guessed on some things and ordered a couple pre-fixed meals anyway. Some of it was ok but overall nothing special or memorable. This was also the only place that actually asked us for a tip when we were paying the bill. My brother naively gave 10% on top of the included service fee/tax and we still tease him about it.",
