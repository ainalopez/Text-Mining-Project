    "Yum. I passed by the new Travel&Cake today and met a friend for tea and a treat. I had a lemon and ginger infusion (herbal tea) and mini donuts on a skewer, filled with creme. Scrumptious. I like the new design too: it's more spacious and airy than the Brunch&Cake farther down Enric Granados. I have yet to go here for a meal but for a coffee or a sweet, you can't go wrong.",
