    "I'm Asian and grew up on seafood my whole life. \u00a0Yeah, their seafood is good, but it's not mind blowing. \u00a0Only people who haven't had seafood before would think that. \u00a0Yeah, it's not as expensive as other places, but that's because you've gotta serve yourself. \u00a0What is this, Starbucks crab?But what really, really sucks about the place is that the lines are horrible. \u00a0They range from 30-60 deep and you'll wait something like two hours to get in there, for decent seafood. \u00a0No thanks. \u00a0That and I don't want to hang out with only cheap, shitty, foreign tourists (loud Italians seem to love this place) in a place that has the ambiance of high school classroom.",
