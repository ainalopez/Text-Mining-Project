    "Excellent tapas here; perhaps the best gourmet tapas I've had in Barcelona! Like many others, we started off our night feeling a bit confused because there are multiple Sensis within a short distance of each other. We walked into the wrong Sensi at first, but the waiters were extremely helpful and even walked us over to the correct one. I was with three others- and everyone here loved everything we ordered, with one exception--the squid. However, everything else was basically perfect. It seemed that the meat dishes were the real stars of the menu here-- the beef filet, duck timbale, and pork tataki were all hits with us. We also loved the risotto and ravioli. The most memorable tapa was likely the mushroom crema catalana-- which was phenomenal, but should have been served towards the end, as a more dessert-like end to the meal. If you are dining alone and can only get three things, I very much recommend the risotto, beef filet, and mushroom crema catalana. You won't be disappointed. I do recommend going with a group of 2-4, though-- sharing here is much more enjoyable as there is so much variety.",
