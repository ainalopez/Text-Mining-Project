    "This place was recommended to me by a fellow Yelper and had a chance to check it out on my last day in Barcelona. \u00a0I'm so glad I did, as the food was fantastic! \u00a0They're conveniently located a few blocks from Barceloneta Beach and very close to the Barceloneta metro stop.Sit at the bar, stretching down the length of the place, and order yourself a cold beer. \u00a0I highly recommend the Filet with Foie Gras and the Roasted Peppers. \u00a0Everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection. \u00a0It was such a decadent and delicious meal!",
