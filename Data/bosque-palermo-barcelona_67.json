    "I've been searching for days to find a good seafood paella place along with other seafood items and I'm so glad to have found this little restaurant about a mile walk from our Hotel Pulitzer. Hands down this was one of the best paella I've ever had. There is a long wait of 30+ mins for your order since each batch is made from scratch. \u00a0But so worth the wait! So in the meantime, snack SLOWLY on appetizers but we decided on getting the mixed seafood platter as well and hands down that was the best seagood I've ever had! So sweet succulent and oh so tender. Really love this restaurant and we shall return again before heading home. Bon appetit!",
