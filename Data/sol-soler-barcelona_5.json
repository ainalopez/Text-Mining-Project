    "Love this place as it seems more local and wow the price is right after days if not weeks of paying way too much for way too much as a tourist it was a breath of fresh air. \u00a0Beyond kind staff and most timely service we have had in Spain. \u00a0I would recommend if you are tired of the tourist rat race and want decent food; Spanish experience; nice people and timely service; and reasonable price. \u00a0Nothing fancy.",
