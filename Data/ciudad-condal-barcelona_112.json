    "Busy with a wait, even fairly early (20:00), but for a good reason. Service was excellent, the food impeccable, and the prices very reasonable. We got grilled shrimp, mini hamburgers (nice and raw), mushrooms and asparagus, grilled mushrooms, grilled cuttlefish, mini squid, eggplant chips, fried mini hot peppers, and little fried fish. The cuttlefish was one of my personal favorites, though everything was damn good. Would happily return.",
