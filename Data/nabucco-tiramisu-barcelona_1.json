    "So this is a great place, right in one of the best pla\u00e7es in Barcelona, and one of the best neighborhoods in Barcelona.The workers here are really nice. You walk right in and they say hi and ask you if they can help with anything, which I appreciate.First of all, for all of our studying needs, they have one area with a electrical outlet in the back which is nice. They also have free WiFi with a password they willingly give out.Next, they serve delicious cakes, and juices, and coffees, and teas, and some sandwiches and more meal-type things as well, so like I said it's pretty multipurpose.I had their chocolate-cheesecake cake, which was really pretty good, maybe a bit dry for me, but honestly some of the best cake that I've had in Barcelona ever so that's really good.The decorations are classic white brick walls with paintings on one side. The tables are made out of really beautiful wood.Great for a date, family time, studying or anything in between, I recommend Nabucco Tiramisu.",
