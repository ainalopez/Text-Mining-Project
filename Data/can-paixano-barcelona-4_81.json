    "Great little place!Ambiance: Locals. This place was full of young college students and some older folks just enjoying their lunch. Very crowded and super fun! This is a standing room only type of joint so don't go here wearing heels and planning to sit.Food: Was ok, I was there mostly for the booz. Also, I don't eat too much pork so please take that into consideration.Cava: AMAZING. I am pretty sure we finished a bottle in about 5 minutes. It was so light and refreshing!",
