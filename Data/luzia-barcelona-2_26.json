    "Conveniently located across the street from our hotel (Le Meridien) and having the appearance of being popular, we decided to give it a try. We actually dined both upstairs and downstairs - each place offering differing menu items. Upstairs (La Xina) was Asian focused, where downstairs (Luzia) was more traditional fare (tapas/pizza/salads).We enjoyed both meals, with La Xina standing out as the better of the two. I was shocked at how delicious the dumplings were at La Xina. We sat at the counter and watched the chefs as they prepared our food, and were in awe of the dumpling chef and the way he made dumpling making look so easy. We shared spicy shrimp noodles, and several different styles of dumplings...ALL delicious. The service was great!Luzia didn't stand out as much as La Xina, but they did offer a rather tasty sangria. We shared a pizza (which was dry and unremarkable) and a few tapas. Service was slow and our waiter was rather inattentive. We were seated near the open kitchen and had fun watching the chef barking orders at his staff. I would certainly eat at La Xina again, but probably not Luzia.",
