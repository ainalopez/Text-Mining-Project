    "A little difficult to find (even for my cab driver), but once you'll do, you'll be happy you didn't give up. \u00a0- Very friendly service. \u00a0Even with the server's limited English and my non-existent Spanish, we figured out what we wanted to eat- The maians salad was incredible. \u00a0One of the best things I've eaten. \u00a0It really was a white fish crudo with some kind of thick and savory sauce and anchovies on it. \u00a0Very, very good- The albondigas meatballs in a clam broth were also delicious. \u00a0They were milder than I expected, but the different flavors complemented one another well- Our paella mixto was almost perfect. \u00a0Nice and moist. \u00a0It was the best flavored paella we've had here. \u00a0The only way to improve the dish would be to have a little bit of a crust- The creme brulee was not very good- The miamimisu dessert was cool, creamy, and full of sugary deliciousness. \u00a0The best dessert we've hadOverall, we really enjoyed our meal. \u00a0One word of warning. \u00a0Although Yelp says they take credit cards. \u00a0They do not. \u00a0Fortunately, there is an ATM around the corner and the server was very apologetic for the mix-up.",
