    "We had a strange experience here! We walked in, were ignored by the two waiters who eyed us as we looked around. We walked into the front where locals were dining. Finally I said hello in Spanish and he waved/shooed us down to the back part of the restaurant where we were greeted in English and handed English menus. I thought this was strange. \u00a0Seemed like a bit of a tourist trap sorta deal, which was weird as I had heard such great stuff about the restaurant. Anyway despite this- the food was good (if a bit greasy) and waiter who spoke English was really nice. We ordered patatas Bravas, anchovies and a tapas platter that had croquettes, seafood and green peppers. It was an inexpensive meal and we were full by the end. I think there are better tapas places out there- also more authentic ones too. But if you just want the food without having to read Spanish on the menu and guess what it is or communicate in Spanish with a waiter- then this is the place for you.",
