    "If you're ever in the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona, you must come to La Plata to enjoy their four special dishes. It sounds odd that a tapas place would only have four things on the menu but don't let that fool you. These four things are worth stopping in for. There is a tomato, onion, and olive salad drizzled with the most flavorful olive oil I've ever tasted.The sardines are amazing. You can definitely eat a plate on your own so order accordingly!They serve baguette with tomato meat and olive oil rubbed all over it. So delish!Don't forget to order the baguette with a sausage. Be sure to enjoy a cocktail or glass of house wine or cava while you enjoy eating like a local",
