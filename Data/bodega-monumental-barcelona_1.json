    "Our last dinner in Barcelona, and we used both Yelp and the hotel's recommendation to find Bodega Monument, a 75-year old restaurant specializing in Catalan-style tapas. \u00a0This means more seafood, which is great since we've been eating so much pork lately.We ordered a number of dishes. \u00a0I would rate a solid 4 stars for the seafood items. \u00a0Service was great overall.Polpo (octopus) was tender and had a bit more spicy kick with the paprika generously added on. \u00a0This dish also had a nice potato wedge and plenty of olive oil.Grilled Asparagus with ham and goat cheese was not our favorite dish, since the asparagus while very thick, didn't seem as fresh or crispy. \u00a0The ham was OK, but the goat cheese was a bit too strong here I think.The mixed mussels (cockles) and clams were excellent - very strong garlic flavors. \u00a0Clams had among the largest and juiciest meats I've had for a while! \u00a090% freshness on the mussels with just 2/20 not opening.Mixed Grilled Seafood is a bargain at 20\u20ac, with a nice assortment of razor clams, large prawns, half lobster tail, lobster claw, a large crayfish, and more mussels and clams! \u00a0Everything here was fresh and good - definitely made for messy eating!Desserts were mixed. \u00a0Rice pudding with cinnamon is a classic dessert often found in Mexican cuisine, but here the rice seems a tad chewier than we liked. \u00a0Their creme brulee however was outstanding! \u00a0It was a light white cream on top with some ice cream below it - so no egg yolks as in the French version. \u00a0The flavors of the Catalan version are much more interesting I think.Overall a very good restaurant, especially for the seafood items!",
