    "Ummm...a bar with the name \"cat\" in it? Yep, count me in. Cutely jazzy yet demonic cartoon cats lined the wall. A historical movie viewing and discussion were taking place upstairs. The waitresses were friendly and didn't judge us on our spanglish as they replied in english. Good veg and vegan options and yummy dessert options as well. Also...Free wifi",
