    "Came here through a suggested guidebook of Barcelona for an early lunch. Not too crowded on Sunday before noon. Ordered Cappuccino and Still Water, Grill Octopus over potatoes (house specialty), Jamon Iberico (fine ham) and breads with garlic and fresh tomatoes.Have to say Jamon Iberico Ham was the best I've ever had (yes, new to Barcelona, therefore I know there are many places to try Jamon Iberico). The ham was very tender, robust flavor and perfect on top of the bread with olive oil, scrub garlic and tomatoes. Grill Octopus had a nice, unique flavor. Highly recommend this place for good food!",
