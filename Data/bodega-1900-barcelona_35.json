    "this place is awesome. \u00a0i came here for lunch around 1 pm when it opened, and it was nice and quiet. \u00a0prior to go to bcn, i had tried to get a reservation at tickets, which is across the street, but i couldn't get anything. \u00a0i heard that albert adria sometimes works at the bodega during the day, since tickets is only open for dinner, but i didn't see him.my server was great and since i came by myself, he thought he would just put some small bites together for me. \u00a0he said to just tell him to stop when i had enuf. \u00a0everything i had was delicious from the seaweed and sesame seed chips, razor clams, boiled prawns, smoked mackarel, tuna conserva, meat empanada, and the fried calamari bocadillo w/ garlic aioli. \u00a0i washed all of this down w/ a glass of vermouth. \u00a0i was way too full for dessert after this, which was fine, b/c i was going to pakta for dinner.",
