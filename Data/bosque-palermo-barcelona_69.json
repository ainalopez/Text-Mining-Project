    "Restaurant is located about 1 1/2 from downtown so it's a walk. The negative is that it does not have ac and it gets very hot in the small space. The locale is nice, service good, food fresh and good and prices unbelievable. We paid 50 euro for 4 and we had everything from appetizers to assorted meats, paella, sangria, octopus, and more. Really good value for your $",
