    "This place is phenomenal. Came here after reading the good reviews on Yelp. Our hotel was about a 15 minute walk away, and we went for it.Came on a Thursday night around 9 PM, and ended up waiting about 45 minutes. Normally I wouldn't bother waiting that long, but the hostess said we can go to the bar a few doors down (La Cava), and she would come and get us. We had some tasty sangria and sat at the bar.When we got seated at La Pepita, I was overwhelmed with all the delicious tapas they had. I came here on the last few days of a two-week trip through France and Spain, and as someone who normally only eats chicken and fish, I was getting tired of eating copious amounts of beef, veal, and pork (as delicious as everything was, my tummy was a bit sick from it). Many reviews here focus on the meat-based tapas, but they have some great vegetarian (or less meat-heavy choices, too).We ordered:- Burrata with watermelon/beet tartare, basil, and arugula. Oh. Mah. Gah. Words cannot describe how delicious it was.- Croquette de jamon- Pan con tomate - Marvelous Gin and tonic (it was), about the size of my head- Beef skewer with chimichurri and other tasty things (by this point I had had a lot of the MG&T and was delirious on food happiness, so I don't recall its exact ingredients)- Boyfriend got the foie grasAtmosphere is fun and ~trendy~ and the staff is helpful. The food was just so good. I'm hungry just writing about it.GO HERE!!!",
