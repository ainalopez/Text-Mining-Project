    "Went for a romantic dinner and were not disappointed. Made a reservation on their website with no hiccups. I recommend ordering a bottle of red wine and enjoying the atmosphere. Definitely order the oxtail mini burgers. I could've eaten 6. We also loved the padron peppers and pan con tomate. The duck timbale was good but not our favorite. Our waitress was so nice and had a shot (or 2) with us and gave us recommendations for clubs.",
