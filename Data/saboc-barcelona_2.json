    "Really surprising and fabulous meal. \u00a0Started with cous cous which was simple and fresh and enjoyable. \u00a0Then moved onto the sea egg which is a slow cooked egg with squid ink and seaweed - interesting flavours definitely but probably the only thing I would not order again. \u00a0Also had the chicken quesadilla which was nice. \u00a0The octopus and potato with smoke was outstanding and it was all we could do to not immediately order another one! \u00a0Finished off with the duck cannelloni which was beautiful.",
