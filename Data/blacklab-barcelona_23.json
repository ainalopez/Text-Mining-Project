    "One of our favorite beer pubs in Barcelona! It has a great selection of local beers and an American/Asian menu. If you want cheap Estrella go someplace else as these are craft beers and cost a little more. They are worth the little extra few euros. But if you want a deal go during happy hour Monday-Thursday. They also have live music on the weekends.The large terrace is sure to be a hit this summer. They have an easy to find location right at the corner of Barceloneta.",
