    "While visiting the mall, a friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat at MasQMenos. \u00a0I definitely recommend this spot and I wish that they had locations in the United States. \u00a0I had jamon iberico de bellota y brie and the mezclum gorgonzola, jamon iberico de ballota y nueces. Both tasted like heaven and the portion sizes were spot on. \u00a0I'd go back and try more items if I could. \u00a0They have a selection of beer, wine, and coffee as beverages and also offer sparkling water. \u00a0If you're looking to try tapas, this place is a sure bet.",
