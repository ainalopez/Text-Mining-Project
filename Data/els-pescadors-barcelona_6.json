    "I mean, this is such a pleasant place to have a meal ...Look, there hasn't been fresh seafood in Ashe County since the Pleistocene, when many of the local fossils were comparatively young Rotarians, so I may not be your go-to guy on, well, ... fish. \u00a0This said, this place is a heck of a good fish restaurant. \u00a0We had some wonderful moules for starters -- fresh, tasty, light. \u00a0Went great with the ubiquitous toast with tomatoes. \u00a0(I think \"ubiquitous\" might be Catalan for \"toast with tomatoes.\") \u00a0Then the fishes themselves: \u00a0a delicious cod, a mouth-watering dorade.... both baked, after a fashion, and served with various fixings (potatoes, onions, peppers) that tasted so good.The food is great and so is the atmosphere. \u00a0You're in a charming, off-the-beaten-track neighborhood (assuming you're at the restaurant, not in Ashe County, which wasn't even charming during the Pleistocene) facing a quiet neighborhood square with a few great trees. \u00a0It's quiet and lightly peopled. \u00a0It's so nice.The people who run the restaurant are helpful and unpretentious -- professional but not unctious (or is *that* the Catalan word for \"toast with tomatoes\"?)We drank a high-end bottle of wine and ate all of the above (plus probably a bit of the writing on the plates, not to mention coffee and dessert) for 130 euros all-in. \u00a0Although that is about 115 euros than we like to spend on dinner for two, in this case it was well worth it.Oh, yeah ... I just thought of something else ... Like I said above, the food is really excellent, and maybe if you are a person who goes out to eat for the food, that's enough to make this place five-stars. \u00a0What I really like about it is the \"two-fer\" aspect: \u00a0Great food *and* great locale. \u00a0So what I find myself wondering is what the place is like when the weather is cold. \u00a0The inside of the restaurant, like all other restaurants in Spain, is a mixture of traditional and 80s disco decor. \u00a0The itinerant Basque football fans who had followed Athletic to Barcelona for the Copa del Rey certainly seemed to be enjoying themselves at a big table indoors, so maybe indoors is fine. \u00a0Or maybe it's just easy to be in a good mood *before* the match.",
