    "Smart concept, a huge indoor space like a market, but with restaurant/dining areas instead of vendors. I noticed 5-6 areas to sit, each with different dialects to the El National food language/experience and stunning decor. After sitting in meat area by accident - my wife eats veggie - we went to Tapas line which took another 10-15 minutes to seat. Overall well worth the 20-30 minutes from time we arrived to time we were sitting (in right spot). Good eats, nice staff, reasonable prices, easy to like ;)Overall we could have used some help navigating the space and options, if not an actual person maybe some signage. If we missed that maybe making it more prominent? FYI if you're 2 people like us you will get seated faster...and also fyi shared boy/girl bathroom with attendants! Can't see how anyone would regret going here, it's beautiful, relatively affordable, with options for everyone.",
