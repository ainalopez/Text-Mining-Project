    "Came in alone on a Monday night for a quick bite. The vibe is really lively, with lots of young and older people talking different languages and trying out the great beer selection (yet not touristy!). The barwoman was really knowledgable about the beers they carry and all the staff is super friendly. THE BURGER (I had the Champion for 6.5e), was delicious. No condiments needed, the patty naturally juicy, the mushrooms melting in your mouth...I'll probably go back just to check out their other burgers, which also sounded pretty mouth-watering.",
