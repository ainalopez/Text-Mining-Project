    "I think it's a great concept , the first Italians has a lovely service but really bad selection of like 4 pastas from which 2 are cold . I went to La Taperia and it was TERRIBLE experience . Service is really bad . Food was ok, tho their bread was like 3 days old and at the end when I asked for the tomato bread they just toasted bread and put a whole tomato on the side and DIY. Sorry I don't really want to try to squeeze my tomato on to the bread . I think the only restaurant worth going into is the fist restaurant at the end where I should have gone ....",
