    "Hmm as far as molecular gastronomy goes, it gets 5 stars. \u00a0Amazingly inventive and technically complex arrays of different textures and flavors. \u00a0They are masters of making something look like one thing but being something totally different. \u00a0Part of that is the ability to use gelatin based skins. \u00a0Sometimes it's just cool but flavor wise, nothing special. \u00a0Other times (as in the case of 2 olives which were not) the explosion of flavor and delicate texture that first cracked then melted in your mouth was amazing. \u00a0When I compare with non molecular gastronomy restaurants, it falls short for me. \u00a0It generates excitement, wonder, astonishment at the technical feats. \u00a0But it does not generate that craving that soon I must come back and have more! \u00a0(Unlike some of the really great Tapas restaurants we visited in the same city)",
