    "Fabulous local tapas bar that's shaped around one long bar counter, and SO packed at about 11pm that I doubted whether we'd fit inside! The two of us managed to squish in and pounced on 2 inches of bar space which we gradually grew to 12 inches. It's loud and busy and definitely not for the faint-hearted - I swallowed my nerves and summoned up some 15 year old Spanish knowledge, whilst trying to catch the eye of one of the old-timers behind the bar who were constantly serving, clearing, shouting and occasionally singing! I managed to shout over an order for two beers but was too embarrassed to be the only person in the place to ask for a menu - so instead we cheated and checked it out on yelp's photos instead ;)I admit to being quite impressed with myself for ordering our dishes, including asking for the spicy potato dish that the guys next to us had. We spotted one of the 3 tables in the corner come free and nabbed it quick, which was much easier to eat at than in the bar crush. The tapas were great - we restrained ourselves with 4 dishes (as it was actually our second dinner of the evening eek!) and I liked them all but especially the classics of padron peppers and manchego cheese. It was really just a joy to be amongst the bustling local crowd and made for great people-watching too - grab someone who knows some Spanish and give it a go!",
