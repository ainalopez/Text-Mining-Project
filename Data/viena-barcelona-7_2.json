    "We came here after reading rave reviews about Viena's flauta Iberic. We ordered a capuccino, two flauta Iberics, and some patatas. I might have raised my expectations too much with reviews, but I was overall underwhelmed with the flauta (and this is coming from Jamon Iberico's greatest fan). The jamon itself was definitely tasty, though a bit fatty. The sandwich was simple, which I can appreciate, but the kind of simple that errs more on the bland side. Also, the bread itself was a bit too crusty for my taste, though I recognize this is entirely a personal preference and many prefer their baguettes quite hard. If you're on La Rambla in the early morning and are jonesing for some Jamon Iberico, I'd say go for it. The price is definitely right!",
