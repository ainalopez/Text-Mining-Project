    "Great find! Surprisingly few reviews on Yelp, perhaps not many tourists run into this little gem?! This was a hipster/foodie delight and so glad we decided to check it out after browsing through the 2016 Michelin guide. The space is cute, pretty modern-similar digs to what you would find in Brooklyn or boho-chic areas of NYC. Staff were friendly and attentive - though pretty casual environment. We came with a big appetite so we're able to try a number of tapas! Atapa-it is the place to go when you are looking for a slight diversion to the traditional tapas. Highlights: creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e fois gras.. Salmon in ginger marinade.. Potato broth with truffle.. Banana chocolate ravioli for dessert! No queuing when we went around 10pm.",
