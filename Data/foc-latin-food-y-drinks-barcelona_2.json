    "Before I even came to Barcelona a friend raved about it, but I'm puzzled why this place is so highly recommended. The food is below average, almost like a chain restaurant in states. The staff wasn't rude, but they weren't very nice either. I was very disappointed by the drinks too, my friends got watery margaritas and the sangria was actually sour. The patio part is filled with smokers and the night we were there a very loud, obnoxious group of young adults. It's in a good location to the beach, but I think there is much better food and atmosphere somewhere else.",
