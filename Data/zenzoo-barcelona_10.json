    "I'm Taiwanese, so I'm super picky about my bubble tea. Most places that aren't authentic are usually watered down, too sweet, or way overly milky. This place is so good! It's run by Taiwanese people as well and it's nice because you can customize how much sugar and ice you want in your drink. They also have tons of flavors and toppings. The boba has good texture and the teas taste just like the ones I have in Taiwan. Can't wait to bring my mom here when she visits!",
