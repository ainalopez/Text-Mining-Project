    "My husband and I came here on the recommendation of our concierge at our hotel in Barcelona. \u00a0They booked a reservation for us for dinner -- a must as this place is quite small. \u00a0They have two seatings for dinner, 8pm and 10pm (or around that time). \u00a0We had a reservation at the 8pm seating. \u00a0We were seated immediately and offered a glass of wine. Because we weren't familiar with the menu (it's all in Spanish), we told our server, who spoke fluent English, that we trusted his choices and wine pairings and to bring us whatever were his favorites. \u00a0We were not disappointed. \u00a0The wine flowed (and was delicious!) and we dined on egg carpaccio, octopus, steak, scallops, and foie gras. \u00a0Dessert was a dense chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream. \u00a0We absolutely enjoyed and loved our experience here and would recommend to anyone traveling through Barcelona. \u00a0Just make sure to book a reservation!",
