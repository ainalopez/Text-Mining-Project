    "Wow! Totally not what I was expecting. This little shabby joint can turn out some good food! It is small and everyone is sitting together which I liked about it. I had the Pim Pan Chicken which was cooked perfectly and very fresh toppings, my husband had the Veal three cheese burger which I managed to have a little taste of... Again cooked just how you want it. Now the best part!!! THE FRIES!!! Awesome, I really have no words to describe how nice they where! The staff? Very difficult to get a smile out of them but I really would not let that put you off after all you are there for the food not their friendship, however we did get a goodbye!",
