    "The owner is a famous Dutch football player, so ofcourse I needed to go and have a look at this fancy loungebar. Located on the beach, not too far for the harbour with lots of other bars, clubs and restaurants. Usually the djs play house/latin/lounge, perfect to dance on and/or lounge on the white leather sofas, next to the dance floor. It can be that you spot some famous, rich people around here as half of the club is a VIP area, full of people who already started on there third bottle of expensive champagne. The toilets can be taken for ballrooms, with enough toilets for 15 people at the same time. Perfect, because woman can be extremely slow when it comes to toiletvisit, which can be quite annoying when you want to get back to your party as soon as possible..anyway, no problems in here! In the beginning of the evening you can have dinner outside on the terrace, with a great few over Barcelonas beach. Only if you make reservations though.. All in all, a night at CDLC costs a lot, but its fun for sure as it combines all ingredients for a great night out: superb food, tasty cocktails, international crowd, goodlooking people, beach, barcelona, sexy house music and an enhanting, asian interior with buddahs, tropical plants and soft red/purple/white lights illuminating the dance floor!",
