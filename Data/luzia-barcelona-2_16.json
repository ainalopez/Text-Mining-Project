    "This was my favorite spot in barcelona when it came to dinner. I will admit when i first walked it, i stood there for 10 minutes and did not get acknowledged once. i left to try and find some place else in the area to eat since me and my friend were starving, with no success we wound up returning a little while later and im glad we did. We were sat immediately and started off with a large pitcher of white sangria what had tons of fruit in it. it was delicious. We ordered patatas bravas, muscles and the rosemary foccacia to start. there was a very reasonable amount of muscles and the foccacia was large in size as well. We also wound up splitting the arugula pizza which was very good. Our waitress was so adorable and altho she didnt speak much english, she was very ontop of everything and as helpful as she could be. It would be cool for them to open a location in NYC. id go... alot.",
