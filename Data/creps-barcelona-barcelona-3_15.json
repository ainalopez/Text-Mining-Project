    "What a combo! Awesome cocktails, (one of the Bartender guys did a mixocologist stint at the Lab bar in Soho) and scrummy crepes. Packed every night I've been in there, this little bar rocks. Nuff said. The menu is err.wellCrepes and Cocktails (yah really). For 4.50 euros a crepe its great value and with most cocktails going for roughly 6.50 euros everyones a winner. On the cocktail side of things you have three laid back and rather witty bartenders, one Brazilian, one Mexican and a spanish dude, and on the crepe side of things there is a charming French women. The simple cocktail menu caters most tastes, but these boys are happy to go off piste and make something special for you if you wish! Bar the french lady, all are full of chat and up for a laugh when they are not crazy busy. With Crepe lady its a case of I'm here to servenose to the grind all night, armed with only her hanky to wipe her moist brow and a pint of water to quench her thirst, she lovingly produces simple but delicious sweet and savory snacks for a hungry mixed crowd in this bijou but charming bar. The first time I went I was quite literally mesmerized for most of the evening watching crepe lady do her thing (maybe the effect of one too many darn good cocktails), but the girl has technique! For me its ham & cheese crepe all the way but the nutella crepe is also a bit saucy. This place pulls in a good crowd which makes the atosphere fun but with a relaxed vibe. Like I said this bar is small and most of the space is standing room only (with a ledge to put your drink on and a few scattered bar stools) but heyThe El Borne district of Barcelona is known for its cool unpretentious style and laid back feel. Round here they don't try to hard, because they don't have to!",
