    "On a street overflowing with restaurants, my friend and I chose this one because the menu seemed to have a good balance of options. We were very satisfied with everything. The decor and the uniform made the restaurant seem a lot fancier and uptight than it really was. We started off with an array of tapas. The white asparagus was so tender and juicy, the garlic shrimp was nice and garlicky, the cheese croquettes were flavourful and soft, and the fried squid was tender, juicy, and not overly greasy. We also got the seafood paella. It was nicely cooked and fresh, but slightly too salty. Perhaps not the best place for paella, but it was nonetheless satisfactory.",
