    "Great little dive in Barcelona. Food is great and simple. The main item seems to be the bocados or sandwiches with various fillings. I had one with Jamon Iberico, cheese, peppers and onions, it was really good. Also we had a fee tapas which were also great. And the best part, cava, which was cold good and cheap. Cannot go wrong with this place. Just be prepared to wait in line and eat standing up in a very tight place. It is so good that it does not matter!",
