    "What an amazing place to visit while at the market. We were able to scout out seats at prime lunch time (1:30pm) without a problem. We ordered the spicy potatoes, baby squid with fried eggs and tripe. The dishes came with a basket of bread. Although the food isn't cheap - baby squid was 19.5 euro, the drinks were cheap - table white or red for 3 euro. It was a fun spot to go too. We absolutely love the dishes. The squid with eggs was amazing - excellent flavor, fresh, cooked just right. The runny eggs and juice from cooking the squid was awesome while soaking it up with the crusty bread. The tripe was also full of flavor and a whole plate full. Overall a really fun place to go. Cool experience and good food, little pricy but well worth it",
