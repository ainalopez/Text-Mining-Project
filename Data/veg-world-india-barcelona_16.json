    "ahhhhh authentic (vegetarian) Indian food in a relaxing environment decorated with tasteful touches from India. The daily menu is delicious with an elaborate salad bar, thali or daily special, and various desserts to choose from for a great price. Quality has never faltered over the years and the staff are kind and attentive. Favourites include Aloo gobi and every curry on the menu really, garlic naan, dosas... and the cardamom kulfi can not be skipped!!",
