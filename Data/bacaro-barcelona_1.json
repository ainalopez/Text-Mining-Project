    "This place is AMAZING!! My girlfriend and I were in San Sebasti\u00e1n a few days before Barcelona and someone told us we had to come here. The menu is created every night based on what's available, so everything is super fresh. We couldn't understand everything available, so the waiter went over each item to help us order. Their customer service is the best I've had in Barcelona. I got the Suprema white fish and my girlfriend got the Ragu. Both plates were cleaned. For dessert, we had the pistachio cake with pistachio ice cream. It was so good we got a piece to go so we could have it for breakfast.",
