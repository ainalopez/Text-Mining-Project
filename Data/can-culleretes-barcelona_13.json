    "A good restaurant serving traditional Catalonian cuisine.My meal started off with a simple salad that was tasty and fresh. \u00a0For my main entr\u00e9e, I had a roasted chicken that was cooked very well and had some great flavor. \u00a0It arrived with French fries, which wasn't that unique, but still was fine with the chicken.Overall the value is great and service was very good. \u00a0The d\u00e9cor is a bit kitchy, yet traditional with plenty of room for diners. \u00a0It's the oldest restaurant in Barcelona and the second oldest restaurant in Spain so it's definitely worth a visit.",
