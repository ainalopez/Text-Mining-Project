    "Delicious vegetarian food with a wide variety of options. I had the pumpkin salad with crispy tempeh, red cabbage, radishes and cherry tomatoes. Also had detox juice with beetroot, celery, apple and cucumber. My meal was very flavorful and colorful. It's great going to a restaurant where everything on the menu would make me happy!",
