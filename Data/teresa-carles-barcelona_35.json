    "Really delicious vegetarian food. I had the pumpkin and tempeh salad, and it was SO tasty - so much flavor, especially the tempeh. Also had the Catalonian cheesecake for dessert, which was also tasty, but it was the salad that stood out for me. As many restaurants in Barcelona do, once they figure out you speak English but not Spanish, they give you an English menu, which is handy.The downside for me was the super spotty wi-fi, and they tucked me in a dark corner of the place. The service was typical of Barcelona (very slow) and they won't give you tap water (also typical). If I were just rating the food, it would be five stars.",
