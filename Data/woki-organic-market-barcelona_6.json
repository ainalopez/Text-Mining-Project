    "Fun and healthy Market and cafe in the heart of Barcelona. \u00a0We stopped in here on a whim while headed back to our Hotel after a day of sightseeing. We had 2 woks, one with veggies and one with chicken. Both were very good. \u00a0If you are veggie or vegan I would ask exactly what is in each wok dish. \u00a0The place also has a nice health food store built in. \u00a0I would recommend this for a healthy meal in Barcelona.",
