    "I'm not sure what this 5 star review is all about. I give this restaurant a 3.5 star to be exact. The restaurant is ALRIGHT. It's a tourist trap. It's full of tourists with barely any locals. The drinks were good. Service was good. Portions were on the smaller side.... Paella was good. The lamb my husband ordered wasn't that great. He describes it as \"mushy\". It's fall off the bone but not the way we are use to. There's no bone. Anyways, we have high standards in our food so this is how we felt.",
