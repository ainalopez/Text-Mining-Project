    "BEST MEAL EVER! (this review is solely based on a New Years Day tasting menu experience--see menu below)Seasonal snacks-- interesting texture, but very tasty.Greater amberjack ceviche--to. die. for. wasn't/still not sure what \"tiger milk\" is but the ice cream complimented the ceviche perfectly.Pigeon confited-- this was probably the \"worst\" thing on the menu, but because I mentally couldn't eat the second half of the pigeon. First bite was REALLY good, then I got psyched out \u00a0about eating pigeon (there are seriously so many fat pigeons in Barcelona that we had pointed out earlier in the day)Green peas--the combination of peas and squid was unique and mouthwatering. \u00a0I'm not sure if the peas were soaking in some sort of fat/grease beforehand, but they were amazing.Rice with lobster-- I don't remember this dish very much, but I also don't remember complaining about it, so it must have been good :)Duck's and pear ravioli-- THIS IS THE GREATEST THING EVERY CREATED ON THE PLANET. I still dream of this dish, it is just fatty and mouthwatering and all the feels you could ever have in one bite.Suckling pig-- reminded me of carnitas, but a little juicier. great none the less.Citrus diversity-- yummy palette cleansers at the end of the mealThe origins of truffle-- one word, CHOCOLATE.The petite four-- yummy little chocolate (white and milk) bites to end your perfect meal**WINE PAIRING WITH MEAL (see menu)-- all the wines were perfectly paired with their dish, and the pours were quite generous.If you're in Barcelona you HAVE to get a reservation here and GO. hands down, best meal I had in all of Spain... worth every euro spent.",
