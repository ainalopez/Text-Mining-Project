    "Chen Ji is a REALLY affordable, delicious, authentic Chinese restaurant.a bit surprising to get such authentic food.it was so good that i had to come back and eat their lunch \"buffet\" (5.5 euros).you should try their hand pulled beef noodle soup for 4 euros, can't be beat.anyways, this place is better and cheaper than many restaurants IN china so come here and enjoy.",
