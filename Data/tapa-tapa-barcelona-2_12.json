    "Tapa chain has multiple locations. One by the Barcelonetta and this one in Las Ramblas close to Gaudi's Casa Batllo which looks amazing at night. I recommend it for sharing a big pitcher (6 glasses) of sangria which also comes in a small size (3 glasses). Some of the favorite tapas were the croquettes and the grilled squid. The patatas bravas are drowned in sauce; I'd ask for the \"salsa y aioli al lado\" on the side. Easy to order by number. Service is slow and understaffed for the busy touristy area. If you just want simple no muss no fuss, it's ok.",
