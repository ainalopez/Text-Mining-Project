    "Dropped in with a couple friends to study and try the famous carrot cake.The goods: Like the reviews said... GET THE CARROT CAKE. It's perfectly moist and sweet and flavorful. And I usually don't like cake. Cafe con leche was standard, nothing crazy, but it went well with the cake. My friend got the ginger lemon (?) cake, which was also good, but not as good as the feature dessert, personally.The ambiance: Cute, cozy, clean. There are a couple seats outside, a couple small tables and a long table inside. Free wifi.The people: Amazing! They were super nice and friendly. The guy that took our orders was very sweet and made us feel welcome. The boss with the \"magic hands\" was also very nice, although he didn't talk to us.I would most definitely come back for the goods, ambiance, the service.",
