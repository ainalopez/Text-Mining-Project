    "Everything on the menu will look appealing, I almost ordered everything on the menu, but my wallet and stomach stopped me.I would suggest staying away from the croquettes, they look interesting but taste very blehhGood cured ham.Great drinks.Very good service and English is spoken.Most of the other tapas were good, I can't really remember the names of the dishes since they're all in Spanish but I can say that you can't go wrong ordering. \u00a0Close your eyes and do the Eeny Meeny Miny Moe.Great for a small gathering of friends or if you're just in the mood to enjoy some good Spanish food!",
