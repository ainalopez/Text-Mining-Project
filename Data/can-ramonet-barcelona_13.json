    "Very reliable and enjoyable seafood and fish restaurant in the Barceloneta district. Probably the neighbourhood's most well-known restaurant. It's been around in its current incarnation since 1956, but people have been frequenting the spot for food since the mid-18th Century. Apparently the Barceloneta's oldest building. Wonderful entrance area, with upturned barrels used as tables, lots of fresh fish and crustaceans on display, and a splendid tiled dining room at the back. Friendly, welcoming service, super-fresh catch of the day, and perfectly executed accompaniments such as asparagus and aubergines, patatas bravas and other urgent comforts. Having a cold beer and some bravas is a good way to start a long lunch. The fish is invariably splendid. A fine establishment. They've got a newer, more upmarket one around the corner, but it decidedly lacks the atmosphere.",
