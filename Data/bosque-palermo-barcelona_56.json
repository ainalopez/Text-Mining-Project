    "Seemingly more of a locals spot due to its location away from the tourist area but travelers can still be found here. \u00a0It's worth the journey if you're walking, the food is very good and very reasonably priced. \u00a0We ordered the patatas bravas and the paella (which requires a minimum of two people to order). \u00a0We wanted to order more but our waiter stopped us, mentioning that what we ordered would be enough. \u00a0The patatas bravas were simple but good and something good to temporarily quiet our grumbling stomachs. \u00a0The paella was excellent! \u00a0I haven't had paella too many times in my life but I'd have to say that this was the best one thus far. \u00a0It seriously looked and tasted perfect. \u00a0The rest of our stay we saw people eating paella at restaurants all over Barcelona and especially on Las Ramblas, but none looked nearly as appetizing. \u00a0For dessert we went with the Catalan crema, a local dessert not unlike creme brulee. \u00a0Wine here is also an awesome deal. \u00a0For a full bottle of house red, white or rose wine its only 3\u20ac50!",
