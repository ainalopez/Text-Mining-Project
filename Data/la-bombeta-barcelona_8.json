    "Late review. Visited in May, and the place was buzzing even though it was a weekday. Its usually filled with locals rather than tourists, which makes it more authentic! The food was amazing as expected and so were the local beer and wine recommended by the staff. Amazing atmosphere, super friendly staff and to top it all off, authentic catalan dishes. A must visit in my opinion.",
