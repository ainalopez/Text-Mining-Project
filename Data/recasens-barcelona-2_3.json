    "We went for dinner, 14 people with fixed menu for 23\u20ac each. The amount of food that we've got for this money is huge :)The menu include wine de la casa, water, beer, then the food - pan con tomate, jamon iberico, all type of cheese, embutidos, salads and at the end dessert.I didnt have time to take any pictures because we were too busy eating and catching up, but the tapas selection is amazing!The salads are 3-4 types so there is something for every taste, the jamon was melting in my mouth! And the great part is that with the menu the tapas are more or less unlimited, so we kept ordering more jamon and pan con tomate and they brought us 3 times more! This is just amazing! :)I really recommend this place for good tapas, cheese and wine!",
