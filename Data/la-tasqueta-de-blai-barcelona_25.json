    "For cheap tapas, this place is great. 1\u20ac/tapas, and 2\u20ac cava (get the cava, it's legit. Plus I accidentally broke my glass because I'm a clutz, and they were super nice and replaced it. But don't be me and break your glass. I could have happily lived my life without the round of applause it brought. Derp.)I'll echo what others have mentioned - it's often crowded (with locals though, yay!) so you'll probably have to stand if you go during prime hours. If you ask to sit outside, you must pay before taking your food to an outdoor table. Be polite when scouring the bar for the tapas you want, but don't be afraid to reach through a conversation for a delicious looking morsel. These peeps know what's up. A heads up that the food is tasty and full of flavor, but will likely be lukewarm or cold, as they will be sitting on the bar through the night. However, people go through the bites fairly quickly and they bring new trays out often, so grab while they're hot if you can. Everything is labeled in Spanish and English, and if it's not don't be afraid to ask. This place is in the theater district, but enough away from the main strip to not be overly tourist-laden. A very Spanish thing everyone should try!",
