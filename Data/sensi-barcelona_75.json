    "Awesome place. Tiny (so if you want a table, it'll be better to make a reservation), but very atmospheric.Tried Night menu (everything but salad) and some tapases. Starter was really nice - perfectly cooked tuna, but they haven't told about the bread, which wasn't part of it. the duck was good and the paella was perfect! Both deserts was ok, but instead of Panna Cotta we got yogurt.And try Normandy-style casserole - the most delicious tapas I've ever ate.",
