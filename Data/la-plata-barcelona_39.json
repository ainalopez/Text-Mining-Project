    "It doesn't get more classic than this. La Plata has been there for years and years and years, and it'll probably stay there many more. The concept is simple yet, in its essence, it is what Mediterranean food is about: simple, few ingredients, no sauces, no fancy cooking, just high quality food. Do not bother in asking for the menu, or trying to guess what could you get. La Plata has only 3 different plates: chorizo (cooked, not fried) on a piece of bread; tomato salad (tomato, onion, olives and anchovies), and of course (the star) fresh fried sardines. Man, these sardines are good! Fresh (it doesn't get fresher than that... otherwise they would be swimming by themselves) and fried. Simple. And good.Oh and of course wine... at 0.80 euro de glass!!! (small, but good who cares? at that price you can ask for more).I used to go there every couple of weeks. Now, every time I go to Barcelona I must go and pay my respects. And in the process, have some sardines.",
