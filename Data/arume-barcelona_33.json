    "This place was our best find in Barcelona! On a small street that even experienced cab drivers don't know without gps, it may appear a hole in the wall place as you approach it. Do not be deceived! From the moment you are welcomed, the experienced and knowledgeable wait staff is attentive and helpful. This was the best ceviche any of us had ever eaten! The flavor of the varied ingredients in every dish were bursting with deliciousness! Caramelized goat cheese with caviar; blackberry mojitas, off the bone lamb, and Buratta salad- \u00a0everything we ordered was top notch!",
