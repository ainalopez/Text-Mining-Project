    "After hitting the beach, come here for that lazy two-hour lunch you crave. Out of the way gem filed with locals. A perfect break from the usual tapas, the menu provides delightful variety. The waiters bring out the fresh seafood to your table before preparing it. The rice dishes are packed with flavor. If your over seafood, don't miss the cabrito (baby goat) and potatoes. So tender, with crispy outside that is a little sweet from caramelized fat. Even the lemon cake dessert was exceptional! The service is not the fastest, but that's kinda the point.",
