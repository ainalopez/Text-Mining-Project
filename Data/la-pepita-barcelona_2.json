    "Very very solid four stars. But it's very strange :/ never had this kind of food before.Came here with a group of five friends and we were seated comfortably. I got the traditional sausage pepita which was \"sausage\", cucumbers, and asparagus. It was good! I can't really describe it but I think this place is unique and definitely a must try for everyone coming to barcelona :) Also tried the fried calamari and it was pretty awesome",
