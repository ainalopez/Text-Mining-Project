    "i had 6 hours to kill in Barcelona on my way from Bilbao w/ a connecting flight to Paris -- on the last leg of an 8-city-vaganza. and after paying respects to Gaudi and his church and visiting St Pau hospital and walking all over the city ,i stumbled onto Can Cargol for a late Catalan lunch before heading to the airport.Perfectly relaxing and satisfying.",
