    "We walked through the Barceloneta area and found Celler de Tapas. The menu of the day for lunch looked good and was extremely reasonable for 9,90 per person. What I liked about this restaurant was the chic and clean decor. In addition, the menu was in English, and the waiters spoke English. The food was delicious! I loved the Mediterranean flavors throughout all of the dishes. The menu came with appetizers, main entrees, desserts, choice of drink (water, soda, or wine), and bread. Appetizers:- Cod coquettes - Delicious fried nuggets. There were also chunks of cod.- Sardines with roasted peppers - Nice to have some fresh sardines.- Fried potatoes with spicy sauce - This was complementary and was delicious! Main Entrees: - Mixed paella - My hubby and I ordered the same entree. The flavors were good as it included lots of squid, mussels, chicken, and pork. I gave the chicken and pork to my hubby. Desserts:- Fried milk with cinnamon- Orange sorbet - Very refreshing! Bathroom was in the back of the restaurant, and it was clean.Other sister restaurants include:- Celler de Tapas on Placa Universitat 5- Celler de la Ribera on Placa de les Olles 6- Lonja de Tapas on Pla del Palau 7 & another one on Placeta Montcada 5- Caputxes on Caputxes 4",
