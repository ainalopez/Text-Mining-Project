    "This place is under-rated. It's cozy, had nice natural light, and the food is delicious. I took myself out for an early brunch today and had a nice bloody mary (though I would have liked it spicier) \u00a0and poached eggs with sun dried tomato and mashed avocado and feta that was perfect. There was also a salted caramel hot chocolate on the menu that was calling to me but I was too full... next time!",
