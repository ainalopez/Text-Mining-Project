    "Picnic is a staple of my little team of brunch goers of Barcelona. Slightly more modern food set in a great atmosphere. Breakfast: Eggs Benedict was great, although it was slightly cold when it came. Quinoa crokettas were great. Great bloody Marys and good coffee. Dinner: It was great to see Kangaroo on the menu, and dinner generally was a great meal. Portions were not large, but that worked for us. Great, friendly staff. We have eaten here a few times, and enjoy coming back.",
