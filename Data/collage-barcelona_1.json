    "Off the avenue diagonal by a block, this hidden gem is worth looking for. \u00a0From the great Sangria, delectable tapas, both pica and main dish, this restaurant won't leave you wishing for more. \u00a0I have sampled several items from each of the categories and they have all been 5 star. \u00a0 Tuna tartar, cod fritters, sirloin aged 21 days, tomato flat bread (best in Barcelona), grilled pulpo, and fresh greens with apples, candied almonds, and blue cheese salad. \u00a0All top notch. \u00a0Don't miss out on a great restaurant with a very friendly staff and delectable food. \u00a0No matter where you are in Barcelona, it will be worth your time to come to Collage.",
