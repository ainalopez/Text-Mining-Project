    "Food is just average but the upsell is brilliant. Beware of the \"erroneous\" bread charge (first line of your bill) and check the prices if sharing. We went for the 50 euro special that could feed 4 to 5 adults after getting several tapas plates and were charged 75 for sharing (x1.5). The special multi course price fixe lunch menu was never mentioned. Skip this place.",
