    "Out of my short list of places I warn people away from vehemently and often is this place. A rip-off in its true form.The prices are just as high as Brunch & Cake, owned by the same people, but...The taste isn't even like \"ok, not as good as Brunch & Cake,\" which it obviously isn't, but the taste is not at all appealing. The first time I came I ordered a fruit salad with the least fresh looking fruit that I could have imagined, like it had been covered with plastic wrap and in the freezer for 48 hours. I've ordered way too citrusy avocado toast, I've ordered overly sweet and under-tasty waffles. The salads with eggs on them are not good at all. The drinks are okay, they are fine.The worst part is that they treat you like you won't notice how little effort is put into this place. I don't understand why they don't make food like Brunch & Cake.",
