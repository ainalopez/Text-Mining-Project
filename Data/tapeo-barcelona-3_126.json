    "Dinner here with a group on a recent trip to Barcelona. \u00a0We ordered... quite a few dishes to share and, happily, everything was delicious. \u00a0My favorites were the braised beef cheek, glazed pork ribs, and salad with strawberries. \u00a0It's a small restaurant, so it took a little while to be seated, but service was very good once we were seated. \u00a0English is spoken and care was taken to describe every dish to us and to help us select the perfect assortment of tapas.",
