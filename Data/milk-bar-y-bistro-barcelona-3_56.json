    "We went for the \"Recovery Brunch\" and stayed for just about everything else. Any place that has a menu catered specifically to hungover people, deserves 5 stars in my book. Not to mention the drinks were so good. Most of the group had bloody's and I had a mimosa. They took a little while, as the place full but they were worth the wait once we got them. The staff was fun and attentive. We have been back a couple of times and they never disappoint. Milk has a sister restaurant called Marmalade that we can't wait to try as well.",
