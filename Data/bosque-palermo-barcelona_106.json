    "This place was very good for a late night dinner. Not awesome, but reasonably priced, clean, friendly, and everything tasted well. \u00a0We got the green salad--the mixed. Salad comes with tuna so don't get that if you mean to get a mixed green salad-- we also had the toasted bread with olive oil and crushed tomato which is the regional thing--good but I added salt. I got the osso bucco with rice, remarkably, the osso was dry but the sauce was. Very good. I didn't like the rice that came with it. My husband had the t-bone on a hot plate with fries. The steak was done to perfection and the fries were really good. And there are open later than yelp says people were still trickling in at midnight.",
