    "Very good \"take out\" Chinese food in Barcelona. Just want we needed after 7 days of tapas. The fried noodles are like American chow mein and the beef with onions was spot on. A touch greasy, hot and full of Chinese flavor. Yum! \u00a0We ordered the drunken shrimp and out came a bowl of fully dressed shrimp in a bowl of liquid. No thanks! \u00a04 entrees and 2 beers $25 euros. The restaurant is very plain and casual.",
