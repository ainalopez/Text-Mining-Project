    "This place is a taste of heaven! Every dish was well balanced and the flavorers were absolutely amazing. We had five dishes... The egg carpaccio, steak and foie, muscles, spinach salad, \u00a0tuna and two desserts. Let me tell every bite was an experience. The service is great! Trust me when I visit Barcelona again this place will be one I revisit :-)",
