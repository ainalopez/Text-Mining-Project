    "There are two things you need to know about this place. First and foremost, it's not an easy spot to find. Look for the wooden doors and a constant flow of people entering through their doors. \u00a0Secondly, there's only one blissful word you must know when entering: bombas (por favor). Congrats, you just learned to order yourself deep fried balls of mashed potatoes with a hot sauce that will amaze your taste buds. Luckily, we also ordered ourselves the bread with garlic aioli along with mussels covered in same aioli goodness. The place will be packed for most of the day, but cozy up and enjoy a delicious and local meal. Also, the service is not attentive, but rather a steady control over the mass of patrons. If that doesn't please you, then perhaps a locals' joint like this with grandma hand-making bombas and managing the kitchen may not be up your alley.",
