    "A market-style seafood restaurant. \u00a0What a fantastic concept! \u00a0You enter the restaurant, order your food from the raw spread in front of you, walk around the bar to order drinks and pay, then take a seat and wait for your number to be called (and it will be called several times as your food is prepared).The success of this restaurant is made obvious from its line. \u00a0The restaurant opened at 8, we got there at 8:03, and there was already a line about 30 people deep. \u00a0The total amount of time spent at the restaurant (from the start of our wait to the completion of our meal) was 1 hr 40 min.THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT. \u00a0The experience is one of a kind. \u00a0We ordered cockles at the suggestion of the fishmonger and it was the BEST part of the meal. \u00a0It was also my first time ever having razor clams, and I would easily order them again. \u00a0If I ever return, I will definitely stick to the fishmonger's suggestions. \u00a0The least favorite parts of my meal were the items I picked on my own. \u00a0:PFinally, the price is extremely fair. \u00a0For just under 50\u20ac, my husband and I had razor clams, cockles, tuna, calamari, salad, bread, bread sauce, and a small bottle of wine.",
