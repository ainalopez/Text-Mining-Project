    "Amazing food. It is like Spanish sushi. It was our favorite restaurant in Barcelona, when we spent a week there in October. The tiny toast with crab salad was like nothing I have ever tried before, I wish I could try everything in that menu with photos (place mat). My mouth still waters when I think about that restaurant. And I have tried plenty of great food in the the San Francisco Bay Area.By the way, service was as good as it gets in Spain :). We did not expect anything close to the American service anyways.",
