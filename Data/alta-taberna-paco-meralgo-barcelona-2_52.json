    "Our first meal in Barcelona and worth it! \u00a0Extremely fresh delicious tapas. \u00a0Gets very crowded for lunch so reservations are recommended or sit at the bar. \u00a0We sat at the bar and watched the waitstaff at work - so amazing. \u00a0Great anchovies, pa and squid. \u00a0Lovely lunch with a bottle of cava.",
