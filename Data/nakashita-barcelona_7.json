    "Great sushi place. Small and very busy. Make sure you have a reservation before you go. We saw quite a few people denied. Good was great; fresh and tasted really well. They give twists to the usual sushi dishes to make them different and also have their signature ones. It was a little pricier. The best thing was their coconut pudding/pie dessert; strongly recommended to try. We ordered more once we tasted it.",
