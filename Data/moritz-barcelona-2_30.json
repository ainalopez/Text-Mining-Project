    "I love the vibe here. The food is simple and delicious. But my fave is the unpasteurized super fresh beer. When we're in town, we have a nice 2 liter Moritz bottle that can be refilled in the bakery part of the restaurant for 5\u20ac! Yes, that's 2 liters of fresh beer for 5\u20ac! Just buy a bottle and they fill it up. Then after that, it's just 5\u20ac for a refill. They're a nice gift when you're heading to a dinner party. Be sure to drink it all within a week or it'll go bad (since it is unpasteurized)... psh a week.. it wouldn't last but a few hours with me! The gift shop is also full of cool trendy gifts to bring home!",
