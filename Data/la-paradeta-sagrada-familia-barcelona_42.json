    "came here before closing after visiting sagrada familia-- a popular chain choice. line up to pre-order seafood choices such as gambas plancha -- grilled, juicy, excellent flavor, even a little sweetness to them drizzled with oil, no ocean flavor, mejillones or musclos with tomato sauce delicious but a little dry overcooked. pulpito grilled tiny octopus salted and pretty good. get the salad with it-- fresh, each bread extra",
