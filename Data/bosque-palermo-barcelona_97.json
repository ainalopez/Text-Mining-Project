    "As we entered Bosque Palermo, we were greeted by the lively chatter and laughs of locals enjoying lunch. Our lovely waitress was very patient with our inability to speak Spanish and even drew pictures of the food for us on the table paper. Since the Paella would take 30 minutes, we ordered a Crema de Almeja (clam soup?) and Grilled Baby Squid. The Crema de Almeja was thick and creamy with just a hint of clam flavor. Such a refreshing take on the typical \"Clam Chowder\" that I'm used to. The baby squid was by far the best grilled baby squid I have had in my life. Fresh, lightly charred and a bit tangy from the squeeze of fresh lemon wedges. The Paella was enormous and more than enough for two people. I would have preferred it to be cooked a bit longer so the bottom could crisp up, but it was delicious nonetheless. I haven't had much paella in my life but Bosque Palermo's satisfied our paella craving. We ended with a Crema Catalana, which was essentially the same as a Creme Brulee but with a slightly less sweet custard. Delicious!",
