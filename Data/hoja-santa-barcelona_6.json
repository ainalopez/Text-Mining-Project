    "Awesome \u00a0Mexican gastronom\u00ede. \u00a0Service is great. \u00a0Don't come if you are starving but if you want a great experience in Barcelona and enjoy Mexican themed food, \u00a0this is the place. \u00a0The guacamole is not traditional but delightful. \u00a0Sopes are not your traditional but the Chile poblano infused Masa was outstanding. \u00a0The dessert! Maiz con chocolate y caleta. \u00a0Amazing . but the corn cob in dessert is not actually corn! \u00a0It's ice cream shaped like corn and tastes like corn. \u00a0The caramel and truffles add so much flavor it was to die for.",
