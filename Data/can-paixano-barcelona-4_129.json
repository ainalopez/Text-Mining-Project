    "All the reviews that tell you to jump right in are on target. \u00a0A bit crowded, but make your way to the bar for great Cava. \u00a0We tried glasses of most types, and liked the naturale the best - although many were drinking the rose. \u00a0The food is simple. \u00a0Jamon, cheese, bread - both hot and cold versions. \u00a0Lots of local and European sausages. \u00a0Simple food, lots of inexpensive Cava, great atmosphere. \u00a0Kind of like the McSorleys of Barcelona. \u00a0Awesome.",
