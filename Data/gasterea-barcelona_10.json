    "What a way to end my stay in Barcelona! I had a fabulous time stuffing myself with pinchos at Gasterea in Gracia.Be sure to arrive and grab your seat at the bar early in the evening - we arrived at 8:30 and it started filling up quickly. This restaurant is away from the touristy areas in Barca but it's still tourist friendly. The menu is in Catalan and English, with the options written in Spanish on chalkboards on the walls. The server behind the bar was awesome! He spoke English very well, and was willing to elaborate on all of the different pinchos and make recommendations. Even after the restaurant filled up, he stayed organized and provided fast and friendly service.The selection of pinchos was pretty diverse and affordable at only 1.90 euro each. There was plenty to choose from... multiple cheeses, vegetables, seafood and of course the traditional jamon iberico. The veal with chimichurri was my favorite! There are a few tapas on the menu as well. The price is right here - I had several delicious pinchos and some tinto de verano for 15 euro.Make sure you drop in to Gasterea during your visit to Barcelona, and check out all the cool shops on Carrer de Verdi for some tipsy shopping after dinner!",
