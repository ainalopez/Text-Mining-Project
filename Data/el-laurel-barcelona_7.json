    "Nice place, friendly waiter.We came in around 7:45pm on a Monday evening, and because the Spaniards dine late, there was plenty of seating available. The place filled up after that, but not full.We both had salads, a couple of empenadas and dessert and a glass of wine and water. Came to about \u20ac55. The food was ok and plentiful, but not blown away.I would comfortably recommend it to friends, but probably not return a second time.",
