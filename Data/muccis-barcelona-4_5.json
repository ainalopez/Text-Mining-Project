    "Great well priced little Tapas / Pizza bar - easy to find on Tallers - very friendly and a great place to watch a game - Potato Bravas and a beer was a great treat in the late evening - Basil Pasta was only 4 Euros and it was a huge portion - Pizza sold by the slice - lots of beer selections - worth a look :-)",
