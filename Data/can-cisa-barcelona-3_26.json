    "The lunch we had here was the BEST MEAL we have had in our three weeks in Spain. \u00a0The service was was excellent - the ambiance is beautiful - we sat along the glass-walled wine room (although the waiter told us in the evening it is much more of a wine bar, louder and reservations for dinner are a must if you want to be assured of a table). \u00a0Every dish was a winner! \u00a0The menu changes frequently but if they have the stuffed zucchini blossoms then do yourself a solid and get them. - outstanding - as was every dish. \u00a0The best part was everything on the menu was available as tapas unlike most restaurants that serve only \"Menu del Dia\" at lunch. \u00a0The wine selection is extensive and all organic! \u00a0And they have a lot by the glass (try a few!)! \u00a0I can't say enough about our experience here. \u00a0When we are back in Barcelona in 3 weeks we will definitely be going back! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05+ stars = Great Lunch",
