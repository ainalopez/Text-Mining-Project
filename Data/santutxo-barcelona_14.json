    "We had a great lunch here. The staff were very welcoming and the food was good. I had the artichokes as an appetizer and was tempted to lick the plate. My wife loved her salad that was surprisingly large. I had a steak that wasn't too bad, though a little unevenly cooked. My wife had the goulash and it was very tender and flavorful. For dessert, she had strawberries and I had cheesecake. Nice place, cool vibes. \u00a0We'd go again, for sure.",
