    "Went there for a business party. Good wine selection. Look down the stairs at the cellar on your way back to the dining area. I had an appetizer selection, broiled white fish, duck breast, and a smothered chocolate cake to die for. Dinner, drinks, desert, and festivities. \u00a0A four hour affair. Welcome to Spain. I will do this place again.",
