    "MUST, MUST, MUST, MUST GO. Best food experience hands down.Albert Adria's newest restaurant, hiring two head chefs Jorge Munoz from Peru, and Kyoko Ii from Japan. Nikkei, which is a Japanese Peruvian fusion, gives you the best blend of dishes you can ask for. Get the Machu Picchu menu. It's worth it. 3 hour ordeal with countless dishes, but for some reason, I kept wanting more and more. I am in love with both Japanese and Peruvian cuisine, so this was absolutely the most perfect blend for me. ALL FOOD SHOULD BE MADE LIKE THIS.Not to mention, I was able to personally speak with Jorge Munoz, who is super friendly and charming. Intimate atmosphere and very friendly staff, and of course, excellent chefs and cooking.Let me tell you, these pictures I'm posting does NOT do the taste justice. The first plate was literally a symphony of flavors from beginning to end. My favorite dish of all was the sea bass ceviche in almond milk-- best ceviche ever. But there were many other plates that had my heart skipping a beat. My mouth is watering just reminiscing this meal.... Life... Changing...",
