    "It is hard to find veg places that really show a love for the veg in vegetarian food. \u00a0This was exceptionally well presented in Teresa Carles artichoke heart appetizer, topped with poached quail egg and microgreens. They are definiteiy a 5 star in presentaiton.They were expertly handled and prepared, savory and well cooked, a joy to pop into your mouth and enjoy. The tofu and avocado tartar was vegan, with gorgeous presentation. \u00a0It was mild and comforting, creamy and satisfying.The entree of aubergine cake with fig and \u00a0baked goat cheese was pretty decadent without being heavy. The desserts were the low point, we got the chia pudding (to its credit, raw vegan desserts dont really show up too often so kudos for even putting it out there).Would deft go again. My expectations were moderately low at first, the menu read like it could be pretty uninspired standard veg fair, instead of the bountiful decadent offerings of fruit & vegetable love where the absence of meat easily went unnoticed.",
