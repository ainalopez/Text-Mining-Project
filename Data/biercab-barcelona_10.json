    "Not only is the beer selection countlessly impressive, but the service is FANTASTIC! I generally hate the service in Spain (not nearly as friendly as it could be), but the workers here are so nice and smiley! I love it! And everyone in the bar was served a free amuse bouche. I'm so glad we ended up here after finding out that Brewdog was closed with incorrect hour listings online.",
