    "A very cool caf\u00e9 offering plenty of organic options. The majority of the food is bocadillos (sandwiches) and there loads of super tasty ones to choose from. Fresh squeezed orange juice, organic coffee and a ridiculously friendly and patient staff (which is probably why there were loads of Americans in there - you can point at every sandwich and ask \"what's in this one? And this one? And .... This one?\" without any eye rolling).",
