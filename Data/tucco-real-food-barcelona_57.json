    "Amazing food - one of the best meals that I've had in Europe so far and for a great deal, especially for college students. It's hidden in a small ally but worth the walk. Each meal comes with a main dish, bread, dessert, and a drink all for less than \u20ac10 and free wifi! The staff were very friendly and the food was so good. I ordered a meat lasagna with a caramel cake and it was delicious. All the pastas are homemade and fresh and you can taste it. Definitely will come back if I find myself back in Barcelona!",
