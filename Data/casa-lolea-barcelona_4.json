    "Was in Barcelona for a week and ate here like 4 times. Fantastic tapas - some of the best we had and really outstanding Sangria. Sangria is their thing and they have like 5 varieties. Standard menus and daily specials. Good mix of locals and tourists in a chic atmosphere in the gothic quarter. Really good service. Great place for an early date or romantic long lunch on vacation. Brilliant.",
