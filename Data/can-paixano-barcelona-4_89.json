    "The chorizo will change your view on life.. I am not joking. For 13\u20ac my wife and I got a cheeseburger (5stars), chorizo sandwich (200 stars), and chopped chorizo... And a BOTTLE of rose. This place is a game changer!! Standing room only, no credit cards, it can be tight but will be worth it! Don't be shy and eat like the locals do!",
