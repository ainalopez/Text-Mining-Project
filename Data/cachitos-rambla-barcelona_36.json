    "The tapas we tried were all terrific (especially the eggplant with goat cheese). \u00a0We thought the chef was quite inventive and the selections varied and interesting. \u00a0A bit expensive, but worth it. \u00a0The waiter made us feel at home and gave us just the right amont of attention. \u00a0After trying a few other places, we'd put this one at the top of our list.",
