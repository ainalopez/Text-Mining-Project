    "CAVA CAVA CAVA CAVAMy absolute favorite bar! I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Of all the restaurants I had in Barcelona, this would be the only place I would recommend to my friends. Seriously, cava for 1 euro? Seriously?! And the food is amazing too. Chorizo was outta this world flavorful, crisp on the outside, a good chew on the inside. Loved the serrano, cheese, pepper, onion sandwich as well. It's big. It eats like a meal. I loved this place so much we came back 3 times in 4 days. Be warned, it's always packed! It's less busy in the morning. You can actually buy bottles of cava to take home for a few euros, but only in the morning and afternoon. Come evening, you can't purchase bottles.",
