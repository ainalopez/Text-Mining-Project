    "I really enjoyed this restaurant experience. \u00a0The people running the place were very friendly and helpful with the menu. \u00a0I had the miso ramen, and it was incredible. \u00a0The broth was piping hot and perfectly seasoned and the noodles were filling. \u00a0I also had the curry pork. \u00a0YUMMY! \u00a0I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu. \u00a0I've got my eye on the onigiri with anchovy.",
