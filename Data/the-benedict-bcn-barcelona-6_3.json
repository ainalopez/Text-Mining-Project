    "My boyfriend and I were excited to try this place for breakfast, we read good reviews and liked the vibe, however the service was terrible. We had to put in our drink order twice, and it took about twenty minutes for our lattes to come. And I can't even tell you how the food was because forty five minutes after ordering our breakfast (eggs benedict and pancakes, not too complicated) and watching all of the other people around us get the same thing AND eat it all AND receive their checks, we never received our food. We asked three times if our food was coming out soon and they kept saying \"any minute.\" It never came, so we left and went to a charming little bakery down the way to pick up some amazing croissants instead.",
