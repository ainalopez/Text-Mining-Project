    "This cute restaurant is located in the Barrio Gothic area of Barcelona and is a bit hard to find. It's located on the back side of the Santa Maria del Mar (famous church). I came here with 2 others for lunch around 3:30pm and they still took us. I ordered from the menu del dia which served a 3-course meal with a drink for 12 euro. If you chose to order from the regular menu, each dish was ~5-8 euro, which is very reasonable considering the quality and taste of the food! I got the tuna salad appetizer which was delicious and came with mixed greens and artichokes. My main dish was fish, which was quite tasty, and my dessert was a mango cake with ice cream, so tasty! Overall, it was great food for great value in a nice, off the beaten path restaurant. I would DEFINITELY recommend coming here again- it's not too touristy :)",
