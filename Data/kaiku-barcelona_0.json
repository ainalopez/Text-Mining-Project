    "Kaiku changed my life. After dinner here, I started to imagine what it would be like to retire in Spain. What an incredible experience.When we came on a Sunday afternoon, all of the seafood being served had been caught the day before. Barcelona is full of great seafood places being on the Mediterranean coast but it was questionable how fresh some of the seafood is. I really love how Kaiku tells you exactly when their fish was caught. :)We ordered a salad to start and 3 main courses for the two of us. Salad was incredible and beautifully presented. I love the how every bite was an explosion of sweet, salty, and sour. I also had the best tuna of my life and the best paella as well. I would go back to Spain just for the tuna and the paella again. Oh, and we also had a bottle of a great white wine from the Montsant region. All for 80 euros.Like all the reviewers have said, this place is kind of tricky to get a table at. They're only open from 100-330h. Definitely stop by and make a reservation. I don't think you can do it online.On top of everything, service was really friendly and helpful. We were the only non-locals here and they treated us really well!",
