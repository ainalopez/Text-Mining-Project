    "We got to CGV pretty close to the siesta closing time so we asked if it was OK to order. One of the waiters enthusiastically seated us... oh yes, no problem...so we sat down. It took less than 2 minutes for a plate of cold churros & goopy chocolate in a messy cup to arrive at our table. Immediately the skinny elderly guy at the counter began to point at his wrist watch .. essentially signaling us to choke our food down & leave. In a city like Barcelona, which for me is the food capital of the world, there's no reason why anyone should suffer such rudeness. Never ever again. Clearly, the tourist guide hype has gone to their heads. La Parallesa is a *100 times* better (San Gines in Madrid being the BEST) for similar fare.",
