    "Excellent food and service. Didn't order any of the entrees for lunch as I didn't feel like eating a lot. Had the anchovy and the cod croquette to start with followed by esqueixada which was excellent. The bread was also very good. Ended with chocolate beignets which came with a delectable scoop of ice cream. Couldn't figure out the flavor but it was very, very good. Ordered dessert with cafe cortado which was excellent. Service was outstanding. Patio seating hard to beat.",
