    "We ate here our first meal in Barcelona! It was a great transition into the world of tapas! They helped us choose the best things on the menu. We enjoyed every thing hat came to our table and gobbled everything down! Favorites include the mushroom croquettes, crab and pineapple salad and the potatoes with a yummy spicy sauce!",
