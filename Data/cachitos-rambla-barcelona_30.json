    "When the tall, gorgeous blonde in the short, tight skirt started talking in Spanish to one of my colleagues he froze. When she told us to follow her, the other guy said 'anywhere'. I'm surprised we ever left this place.It's a large room with three floors I believe. They took us upstairs to the dining room. On the lower level is a very sexy looking lounge that you'll see when you go to the restrooms.Our server was very helpful and patient and spoke very good English. She let us know all of her favourite items. We ordered a few tapas and some paella. It was good, not great. The sangria was tasty but totally overpriced. We moved to wine afterwards. This place would be good for groups and people who are feeling a little less adventurous. Also for those who enjoy long-legged beautiful hostesses taking you to your table. :D",
