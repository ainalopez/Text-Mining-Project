    "This place totally loves up to the \"yelp\" hype...everything I had was great, but really the strong suit is the tapas! I went alone and the bartender mentioned that people tend to get 2 tapas and one main...let me tell you, that was probably too much food. That said, all tasted amazing...so really no biggie.Tip: go early, the place is small and it fills up quickly, so you don't want to be waiting outside looking in!Make sure this place is on your \"must visit\" list.",
