    "This was such a great experience while on my trip to Spain! Authentic kind service food was amazing! Love the scallops and the gazpacho with lobster and melon! WOW! We had to go back to let the rest of our traveling companions experience it! Definite must go - \u00a0off the beating tourist path and very relaxed upscale atmosphere. Will be back when I return to Barcelona.",
