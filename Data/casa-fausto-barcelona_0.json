    "This place is a gem! Our favorite restaurant in Barcelona. Once we found it, we'd have a least one meal a day here- don't judge! Hey, you'll want to stay here forever once you try their food. It's such an unassuming, welcoming restaurant. The owner and all the staff truly make you feel right at home. Now for the food, it is, to put it simply- superb. The chicken encrusted with peanuts and curry sauce, the foie gras burger with home-made tomato bread, the burger with home-made olive bread... These all haunt my dreams and my taste buds. As I would eat these, I would just give silent prayers of thanks to the universe for allowing such beautiful and amazing creations to exist. Everything we tried at Fausto's was excellent- calamari, pan con tomate, patatas bravas, ternero stew... I could go on, but you get the idea. Everything was awesome and makes my mouth-water just thinking of it. I simply cannot wait to go back. When I do, I'll make sure to kidnap the chef and bring him back with me. Seriously, be sure to go to this restaurant when in Barcelona.",
