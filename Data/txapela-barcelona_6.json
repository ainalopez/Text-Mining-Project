    "Decided against eating here, as it was weird that they had the food displayed in cases. The menu pictures were terrible, so I guess it was needed, but it was a turn off. Also it was super hard to figure out what the food even WAS. We had one glass of wine, and were on our way. \u00a0We had awesome tapas near La Palau de la Musica, so this place was a bit disappointing to us. Seating was all stools around a long oval bar with the cases of food all along. Weird set up.",
