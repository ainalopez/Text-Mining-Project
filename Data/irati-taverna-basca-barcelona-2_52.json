    "this is for the bar area only.we came by while we were doing our self-guided walk down the las ramblas. at first we weren't too sure what to do and were a little intimidated, but after we got plates from the waiter it was very simple: you grab whatever you want and eat! it looks like the cold ones are set out on the bar and every time a hot one comes out they pass it around to see if anyone wants them. in the end they count up all the tooth picks and give you a total. with a group of 6, the price didn't turn out to be that great of a deal but overall we enjoyed the experience and all the dishes we tried were very tasty.Since everyone grabbed their own choices, I'm not sure what we all tried, I personally enjoyed the tuna sandwich, the mushrooms, and the crab sandwich. One thing I would add though is there are no seating in that area so be prepared to stand during your meal, which can be rough if you've already done a lot of walking/touring beforehand.",
