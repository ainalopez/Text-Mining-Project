    "I don't know what everyone sees in this place. \u00a0 It is located just off the main tourist strip in what appears to be a nice plaza. \u00a0There is a lot of outdoor seating (which is always a plus).The centerpiece of the plaza is a children's playground surrounded by buildings in which some have bricked up windows. \u00a0 Service was brisk both times I was here. \u00a0 Prices were very tourist like. \u00a0They have a lot of talapas on the menu and the ones we ordered were okay. Outside of that the main entr\u00e9es are burgers. \u00a0 My beer, when it came to the table was well below the .5l marker on the glass. Why serve a customer a glass with a marker when you're not even going to come close? \u00a0 \u00a0That pretty much sums up my experience.",
