    "If you are looking for a nice romantic spot to enjoy exquisite cuisine with impeccable service, don't go here. On the other hand, if your looking to rub shoulders with locals and stuff your face full of garlicy wonderfulness in a no-nonsense but altogether charming family style establishment - look no further.",
