    "Ok, I'm writing the review before cheese course. First impression as I walked into the restaurant is that this is a classy place that I would want to be a regular if it were in NYC where I live. The plates, silverware and glassware all gave the impression that this is an established place. The menu is not complicated. The number of selections under each category won't overwhelm you. You just need to decide what you want tonight - seafood or meat. I went for the \"exotic\" goat. But I opted for the seafood pot - clam, mussels as starter. I wished I ordered the tripe. Maybe next time. The cheeses are divine. I would suggest that one sample at least three, especially the ripened, soft, pungent variant. Enjoy.",
