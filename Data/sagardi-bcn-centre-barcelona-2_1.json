    "Loved this place , the tapas were little works of art to be honest. The place has a nice atmosphere of casual tapas/ wine stop plus there is a restaurant area inside. We just stopped at the bar for tapas and wine on our way to tour the rest of the city. I recommend this place as a stop for a bite or two.",
