    "I'd say that my primary reason for visiting this place is because it's been around since 1897 and was favored by Picasso (the man himself) and other Spanish artists. \u00a0It's located in a very small/quaint cobblestoned street that gives you a very Sherlock Holmes feeling. I suppose this only applies when you come here for dinner. They've got a pixe-fixe menu which is an absolutely bargain. \u00a0Their menus vary depending on what's in season and you can never go wrong with dessert. \u00a0Don't take my word on this because i'm pretty biased when it comes to dessert and I love allllllll kinds. I do remember having their chocolate mousse with raspberry and some Catalan custard thing and they were both amazing. \u00a0If you love art, decor, great food and awesome service check out this restaurant. \u00a0It's got amazing history hung all over the wall.",
