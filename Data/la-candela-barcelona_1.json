    "3-1/2 stars. This place is exactly what it should be, no more no less. It's a small bar serving inside and to the square of Placa de St Pere. Two of us stopped here for breakfast, sat at the bar inside, and got coffee, tea, croissants, pan amb tomaquet, and zumos. The orange juice was fresh squeezed, but somehow not as flavorful as I would have expected? The coffee was fine (but bistro-standard too-hot), the croissants were tough. Perhaps breakfast did not show La Candela in its best light... we'll try again later at night for tapas and drinks!",
