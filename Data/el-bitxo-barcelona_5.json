    "Tiny little place just a couple of steps from the Palau de la Musica yet somehow seemingly far away from the tourist bustle. Excellent food selections prepared on site by the friendly owner who is quick to engage in interesting conversations. Mostly cold tapas as they don't really have a kitchen, per se, but still excellent and fresh tasting. The menu is written on various boards on the walls so don't bother asking for one.",
