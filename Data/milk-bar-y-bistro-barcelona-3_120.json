    "Went here for brunch and had the pancakes and french toast. Both came with berries and cr\u00e8me fraiche wich was a really refreshing combination! The pancakes had a whole wheat taste and were soaked up in just the perfect amount of syrup, I really enjoyed them!!The portions were big and the price totally okay (7\u20ac per meal). The fresh orange juicy tasted a bit unnatural to me but maybe they just used very sweet oranges! The staff is friendly and speaks perfect english, the menu is also in english and the vintage-atmosphere is just perfect for a nice brunch! The menu is very american though, so if you're looking for just a croissant and coffee this might not be the right place. But I would definitely come back!",
