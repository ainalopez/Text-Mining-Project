    "Crowded with tourists and locals alike for good reason, Moritz is the taproom / gastropub of my dreams. First let's talk about the main event, the beer. At Moritz, you can try the fresh, unpasteurized brew that comes directly from the brewery. No ride in a truck, just fresh out the tank with some carbonation. It is really delicious stuff.Then the food is just amazing. The menu is absolutely enormous, but somehow, ALL OF IT looks good. My pick would be the Catalonian style choucroute, which is similar to the Alsatian one (which they /also have/...!) but they replace all the sausages with Catalonian traditional sausages, including a delicious blood sausage.The service might be the worst part of it, but not for lack of trying. It is just a big space, and not quite enough servers to handle the multitude of tables requiring service. We had a hiccup with our credit card being charged in USD [1], but the waiters are not trained on the use of the terminals and were very apologetic. (We came back a few days later and he was still apologizing! We paid in cash that time. Stupid greedy banks.)Their gift shop is a bit expensive but somehow, I found myself walking out with a big metal sign to put up on my wall!I love Moritz and it will be my first stop if I ever find myself in Barcelona again - which I think is quite likely.[1] en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dy\u2026",
