    "We stumbled onto this cozy little tapas bar on our first night in Barcelona. The main eating area seems to be in a basement wine cellar, which is appropriate considering the amazing wine selections offered here. Everything we ate was delicious and the portions were large. The staff couldn't be more helpful. We ordered a cheese plate and asked about the different cheeses on it. All we really wanted was to know the names of each cheese, but they did their best to give us a detailed explanation about each cheese and its origins. It was a wonderful introduction to Spanish cuisine.",
