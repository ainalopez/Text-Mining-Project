    "From the moment we stepped in the door we had a fantastic experience- they were so friendly and willing to answer every single question we had about the menu- great about making suggestions without being pushy at all! And oh my goodness- the food!! we shared the pasta and vegetable lasagna- as my husband said \"the best lasagna I've ever had\". They are incredibly reasonably priced to top it all off! I would 100% recommend this as a must try for your stay in Barcelona!",
