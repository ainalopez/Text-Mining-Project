    "tough one to rate: can easily be a 4-star for most tourists, feel it's a trap but can say these huge red shrimp are one of the yummiest ever: from Morocco.as well as the most expensive, 2 for $18. was it worth it: yes, for a Yelp foodie but not to the average Joe. \u00a0 my half can also eat the insides of the head, also said the best.the scallops too were good.whats cool too is the free wifi & a real wait list as the other places ere seem to be a free for all lol.tip: don't order Coke $5 as it's more expensive than beer! just that we ate&drank 2 other places here in less than an hour lol",
