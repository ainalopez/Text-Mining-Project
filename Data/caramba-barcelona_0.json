    "Been eating our way through Barcelona for 7 days- this is the best place so far. The food is innovative and delicious. The ambience is perfect. The staff are incredibly sweet and prompt. They make great drinks, highly recommend the mojitos, carambitas and sangria. The tapas are top notch and I highly recommend any of the huevos rotos combinations and the honey soy pork was awesome as well. This place is utterly affordable too, which is insane given the high quality of the food.",
