    "I was prepared for this place to be in a great beach location, but not the greatest food. Often this is the case with tourist restaurants on the beach. I was very wrong. The food was as good as the location. The beef carpaccio was excellent, very fresh mussels and clams with an excellent sauce. Everything down to the desserts and espresso was very good. Prices slightly higher than restaurants in town, but well worth it!",
