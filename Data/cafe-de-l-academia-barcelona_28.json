    "WONDERFUL PLACE! Pretty much best dinner we have ever had. Opens at 8:30, be there early so you can get a table. Definitely worth the wait! Free bread and olives...and the best dinner in Barcelona. After being tired of tapas we decided to have a real dinner. We checked out Yelp and found this place which was a GEM! Great atmosphere and food this place was just what we expected in Spain. Two of us had Salmon with mozarella and tomato (AMAZING FOR FISH LOVERS) and linguini with shrimp and garlic (equally as delicious)! We had wonderful service, food was out quickly and we were waiting on by the owner. Love, love, loved it definitely need to go best meal we had in Barcelona, let alone all of Spain!!",
