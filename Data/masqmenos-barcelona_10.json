    "A nice place for sandwiches, salads, or cold tapas. Nice selection of hams and cured meets. Outdoor seating is great for enjoying your wine/beer/sangria at leisure. We had the Jamon Serrano, tortillas (Spanish - egg, potato, and lots of olive oil), and a nice mesculin pine nut salad. All tasted great. The white wine and the tinto de verano were appropriately good.",
