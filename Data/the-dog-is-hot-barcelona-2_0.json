    "The Dog Is Hot caught my attention when I was walking toward the Metro. I needing food and their menu sounded intriguing. I participated in a very physically demanding class, so I needed food. After glancing through the menu, I decided not to order anything too \"American\", so I ordered the Specialdog. It came with arugula, tomato seco, cebolla cruda, guacamole and queso rallado for \u20ac4. If they ask you if you'd like ketchup, mayo, and mustard, just say no. They offer a load of different sauces like bbq, caramelized garlic, mango curry, picante and more. Overall, it was a decent dog. The bun and dog were both light as if made of air. I like my buns and dogs to have more substance, greater flavor. The guacamole and onions were unevenly spread. The tomato, arugula, and cheese were nice touches. It does seem like a nice late night spot in the Gracia neighborhood.",
