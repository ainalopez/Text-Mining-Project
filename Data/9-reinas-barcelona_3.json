    "We visited our last night in Barcelona. \u00a0I wish we had went sooner, \u00a0if so I'm sure we would have dined here another time or two before we left!The restaurant is small, modern, \u00a0nicely appointed. \u00a0The hostess was friendly and sweet and seated for our reservation promptly. \u00a0Our waiter, \u00a0Diego, \u00a0was very knowledgeable about the menu and more than willing to spend time to describe the menu. Our first course, spicy meat empanadas were amazing. \u00a0The filling was moist with just a bit of spice. \u00a0The pastry was tender and crisp. \u00a0The best empanada I've had. Our second course was a pumpkin filled ravioli with pink sauce. I had to stop mid bite to savor the deliciousness! \u00a0I wanted 2 orders of this it was that good! We both ordered the Ribeye steaks. Cooked perfectly. \u00a0Served with roasted potatoes with cream. \u00a0We also had waffle potatoes with fried eggs, \u00a0I can't explain how good these taste. For dessert we had a caramel mousse which was light and satisfying. Overall, \u00a0this was an amazing dining experience that I would not hesitate to recommend to all!",
