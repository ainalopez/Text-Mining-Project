    "From entering at the main entrance of the market, it's in the back towards the left. Friendly eatery with a focus on seafood dishes. They spoke English and had menus in French, English and Spanish. The staff were good at handling the queue even though there wasn't a real queue as people just move up to the bar as others are eating. It was about a 15-20 min wait at 230 pm on a Saturday. It's cramped eating at the bar but this whole market is cramped so it's all relative. Ordered calamari (10\u20ac) - ok not super flavourful or tender. Patatas bravas (5\u20ac) were delicious!!! 3 grilled sardines (4\u20ac) as he didn't have a full order for us was very good. And the seabass (13\u20ac) was simply cooked and came with fries. Very fresh fish. Cava was 2.75\u20ac per glass - can't get over how inexpensive cava is here!Staff were friendly and food came at a good pace. Overall good to average place.",
