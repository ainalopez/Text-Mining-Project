    "This is one of the few places in Barcelona we loved! \u00a0Carpe Diem Lounge & Club is not a nightclub as categorized here, but it's a pretty cool restaurant and swanky cocktail lounge with giant beds you can relax on. \u00a0The entrance above ground resembles a blink-and-you'll-miss-it kiosk. \u00a0The underground lair, however, is spacious and well decorated. \u00a0I had the non-alcoholic cocktail - some fruit smoothie - and it was delicious! \u00a0Perfectly refreshing and sweet after a humid summer night on the beach.",
