    "One of those happy discoveries as we were walking back to our hotel. This great bar has a unique space with tables and lounge areas. Lots of sharing plates and the best bread I've ever had drenched in olive oil and some tomato. The server was so friendly and helped us translate the Catalan menu very patiently. We ended up with a plate of the best Iberian Ham I've had in spain (12\u20ac) and cheese accompanied by that awesome bread. We also got one of the tostas which is recommended.For dessert had a really creamy cheesecake. So good. We might actually come here again for lunch at some put. Seems like they have pastries and Cafe during the day.",
