    "Visited this place on a cold night and found the best service I've had in Barcelona so far.. Of course, there barely is such a thing as service in Barcelona, but hopefully you get my point. The barman was extremely helpful when I asked him for the vegetarian options. The pinxtos are 1.65 which is cheap and there's a lot of variety. They also have some delicious looking mini desserts that I didn't get to try. \u00a0Jesus was our waiter and he was very funny and just seemed to be in an overall good mood. :) I will definitely be going back!",
