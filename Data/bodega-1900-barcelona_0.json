    "I ran into this restaurant on the way of searching for my Airbnb host. The waitress was very nice to show me where I should go. Turned out its right across the street. After shower I planed to go back to the restaurant to have a late dinner like every espanol. But it was already about to close. \u00a0The manager suggested me to make a reservation right there, because it's always full! Why not? I just wrote down my name.I didn't realize the popularity of this little restaurant until I got there on the time they opened next day. There were already people waiting outside. And many of them seem like tourists. As I sat down, I heard most of them asking for recommendation as I didAs the food were presented one by one. I started realizing the reason. All dishes looked so delicate as they tasted. Small dishes with great quality. Reminds me of Japanese food. It was obvious that it was not only my opinion. People around me kept nodding their heads and saying \" delicious, delicious\" I enjoyed it so much that I decided to take a desert even I was quite full. Homemade cheesecake was full of flavor as well.Everything was great until I received my bill. Hahahah. I didn't even ask for the price for each dish. But hey, \u00a0I'm on holiday. I deserve it. Right?",
