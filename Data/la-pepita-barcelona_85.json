    "Came here on the recommendation of my little brother and TripAdvisor, and so glad we did!Note: the kitchen doesn't open until 1pm, but they do offer fresh OJ, coffee, and croissants for a quick breakfast. \u00a0Since we didn't know about the kitchen situation, we came too early one morning for tapas, but ended up getting a bocadillo entero (prosciutto, cheese, tomato sauce sandwich), which really did hit the spot. \u00a0We grabbed a seat at the bar and watched the locals coming in and out and the baker come to drop off the day's bread - I was actually glad we were able to experience this, a glimpse into the lives of the locals.Anyways, not to miss out on their tapas, we came back later that day (oh yes we did) for lunch - and I'm so glad we did - one of the best meals we had during our 4 day stay in Barcelona:GOLDEN PEPITA - I highly recommend this dish. \u00a0Steak, foie gras, and a baked egg - need I say more?!Bikini - Brie, ham, truffle on a bed of spinach, pumpkin seeds, raisins - so it took me a little while to realize that a \"bikini\" is just another name for a toasted sandwich with the crust cut off, yes?Sea bass with strawberries and spinach - I loved the flavor.Very Important Croquette with ham \u00a0- Not that much different from other croquettes we'd had during our visit.Argentinian beef skewer on beans - Didn't really wow me after the first couple dishes.The service was kind and quick. \u00a0At lunch they recognized us from breakfast, and we super accommodating (we had brought our luggage since we stopped by on the way to the airport) and helped us with our bags (they offered us a table in the back with room to store our bags, but since we'd be in and out, we just pulled up to a corner at the bar).Loved this place - HIGHLY recommend!!!",
