    "Great vibe, great food, great tapas. \u00a0Our favorites: padr\u00f3n peppers, iberico ham and manchego cheese, red peppers and goat cheese, olives, eggplant with goat cheese and ceviche. \u00a0Don't forget the Vermut and Cava. \u00a0We came here twice in three days....the second time after being very disappointed in a Pla\u00e7a Reial tourist trap....wish I could eat here every night.--",
