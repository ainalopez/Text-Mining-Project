    "Oh my gosh... the seafood paella. i'm tempted to buy another $1,500 plane ticket to Barcelona just so i can eat it again. I stayed in Barcelona for a month and had a lot of paella and decided to try this place as a recommendation from a friend and it was by far thee BEST place for seafood paella. Our waiter was super funny and friendly and didn't treat us like dumb tourists for ordering paella for dinner (you're supposed to eat it for lunch). The seafood was plentiful and the rice was perfect. It's right off La Rambla but hidden enough in the alleys that it doesn't make it very touristy. The next time I come to Barcelona i'm coming back everyday!",
