    "Touristy spot but sometimes you have to. They offer free drinks while you wait. Food is not traditionally tapas, as there is some Italian influence but it's decent. The risotto is good, meat plate was nothing great. The service is ok, a few things took awhile and I feel I was being a bit rushed.",
