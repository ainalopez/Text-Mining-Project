    "If you're looking for authentic, rustic Catalan food Can Margarit is the place for you! Don't mess around, order the rabbit. It is the best thing on the menu followed by the lamb chops. The place has a friendly atmosphere and before you sit down you can try as much of the great Spanish wine as you like, for free!",
