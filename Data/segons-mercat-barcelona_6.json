    "When one of the top personal guides takes his private tours here - you suspect it's good. Great seafood and tapas in a restaurant frequented by the locals. On the night we visited Spain had just beaten Portugal at football so everyone in Barcelona was celebrating. The Manager at this branch was a friendly Paraguayan who has lived in Spain for a while .... so he had mixed feelings about the Fifa 2010 football as at the time we visited both Paraguay and Spain had just gone through to the next round. Situated in the Barceloneta area you are in the delightful fishing quarter and minutes away from the beach. Wonderful area that deserves as good a restaurant. There are other Segons branches in Barcelona too.",
