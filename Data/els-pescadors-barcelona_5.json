    "Lunch is a little less pricey. \u00a0Dinner was wonderful. Highly suggest getting the aged t bone steak and sharing with someone. Wait staff was one of the best on the strip. \u00a0Seats are more comfortable than the other 4 places. I'm allergic to most spices and they figured out how to accomdate. Made my night. We will go again.",
