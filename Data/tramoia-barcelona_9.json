    "husband + i had a late lunch here on the street level of the bistro where tapas + montaditos may be served, rather than a fancier sit-down restaurant in the upper floor. \u00a0the wait service was friendly enough (especially the guys behind the counter), though our own waitress was kind of nonexistent. \u00a0they do provide the english translation of their menus which was fabulous (towards the back of the menus with the catalan version in the front). \u00a0here were the small dishes for sharing that we had:daus formatge: \u00a0cheese cubes which were okay + nothing to write home about.montadito solomillo: \u00a0grilled beef sirloin. \u00a0my husband had this (not i) yet he said it was pretty good beef.xampinyons saltejats: \u00a0sauteed mushrooms that were fabulous + tasty! \u00a0i wondered what they seasoned it with + wish we ordered a second round of this dish.croquetes bacalla: \u00a0cod croquettes with aioli for dipping.for overall service + the mediocre montaditos (the exception being the sauteed mushrooms), this place gets a solid 3-star rating from me. \u00a0if i hadn't had better stateside, i suppose the rating would be higher; but considering this is catalan country, i would have expected better.",
