    "Ok... This is a difficult one. They try pretty hard with the decorations and always have incense burning off of Hindu or Buddhist statues (doesn't smell that nice but not overwhelming). This restaurant seems to love to employ tall skinny girls that wear revealing outfits, somewhat off putting to me since I can't tell who the men waitors are because they just wear black shirts. They also have masseuses walking around??? Super weird and uncomfortable to watch someone eating and getting a massage from some girl in spandex and a \"masseuse\" shirt. The most alarming thing was our food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered it. Not the usual laid back atmosphere I love in Spain, although this restaurant is technically on the beach. Good lucking getting a spot there. Our waitor took our food when people at our table were still eating. Looks like they really want to turn tables on the weekend. Food was mediocre, my tuna was room temperature and no one liked any of the Indian food they attempts to serve. Music a bit loud and this weird sex atmosphere with these bed table canopy things. I would not recommend (unless already drunk) and would not come back really. Try it if you want though!",
