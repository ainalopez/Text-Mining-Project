    "Italian in Barcelona? Absolutely, and pretty damn good, too!Like a lot of other fellow travelers, you sometimes need a break from tapas . . . Il Massone was a perfect break. \u00a0Salads were plentiful and the greens fresh--worth getting. \u00a0We split the spaghetti carbonarra which had buttery pasta and a light, but tasty cream sauce that didn't overtake the dish--superb. \u00a0Next came the pizza which spent about 20 seconds in the open between the oven and our table: thin crust that was just the right amount of crispy and chewy, and the onions, peppers, salami and olives were excellent additions. \u00a0Lastly, tiramisu rounded out a really tasty dinner--light and creamy--really good! \u00a0Round out the meal w/ excellent/friendly service from our Italian hostess/owner, and I readily offer up 5-stars!!Cheers!RS",
