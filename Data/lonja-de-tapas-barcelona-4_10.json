    "We had a great lunch at Celler de Tapas, so we knew that Lonja de Tapas would be just as good. The food was delicious. We ordered a variety of tapas from the menu. English menu was available and the waiters also spoke English. We had the following:- Tomato bread - I liked this tomato bread compared to La Plata. The bread was toasted and lots of yummy olive oil infused with the tomatoes.- Potato and egg with foie gras - My husband liked this dish a lot! The foie gras was not as good as his dish at El Quim, but it wasn't bad.- Eggplant, artichokes, and sundried tomatoes - So awesome since they were marinated in olive oil. - Shrimp in casserole - Out of all of the tapas, this was disappointing. The shrimps were really small. - Scallops with asparagus and peppers - Pretty good. - Tomato salad with smoked salmon - Loved this salad. The heirloom tomatoes were awesome. The red onions weren't overwhelming too. Loved the smoked salmon. It was an interesting combination of soy sauce flavors with the smoked salmon. - Crispy potatoes with spicy sauce - Complimentary which was delicious. - Octopus with potatoes - The octopus was actually fatty, but it was good. We spent around 48 euros for dinner which is pretty pricey, but at least we liked the food.",
