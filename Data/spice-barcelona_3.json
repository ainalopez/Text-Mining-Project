    "I always wondered why this place wasn't busier. I found the carrot cake a little sweet and not spicy enough--same goes for the chai latte- and the Spanish bagel (minus ham, which they discounted me for! How sweet) a little salty and underwhelming (why was I getting a bagel in Barcelona??) That being said, I still craved their food and went a lot.But the other drinks I got were fantastic--the cafe con leche and cortado were by far the best I got anywhere, the ebony mocha was unbelievably delicious, and my friend said her caramel mocha was amazing. Bars in Barcelona are usually ugly and dark. Spice is gorgeous and airy, a great place to spend hours studying or talking. They have a ton of magazines, in Catalan, Spanish, and English. The staff is sweet and bilingual. This is how sweet they are: I was with a friend talking one evening, until 9:15, and they didn't even tell me they closed at 9:00 until I went to order something else.",
