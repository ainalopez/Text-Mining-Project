    "During our recent stay in Barcelona, the Moritz was right around the corner from our hotel (Hotel Advance) and instead of the overpriced breakfast at the hotel, we ate here every morning. The service during breakfast was pretty horrible- we always had to flag our waitress down to get her attention after patiently waiting with no service. But the prices were very reasonable and they have a fantastic variety of coffees. And how can you go wrong with fresh baked pretzels (with butter and jam?) and beer for breakfast? The coffee with a large shot of brandy will put you right back in the saddle. Great variety of seafood for dinner, and the weinerschnitzel was as good as I had in Austria and Germany!",
