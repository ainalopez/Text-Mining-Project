    "La Pepita was amazing. I believe the food deserves 5 stars, and everyone with me would agree. My friend said the Golden Pepita was the best meal she's had in Europe. I give this restaurant 4 stars only because of the small space, which cannot accommodate the huge amounts of people wanting to eat here.",
