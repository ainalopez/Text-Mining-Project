    "We got in late to Barcelona, around 9ish, and were feeling peckish so we asked the counter staff at the hostel if he could recommend a place to eat. He suggested Blai Tonight as it is less than a two minute walk away, affordable, and offers delicious cuisine.It was quite busy, but not jam packed, so you were able to see what was available. You basically picked what you wanted and keep the toothpicks and they charge you according to how many toothpicks you have - it is one euro per toothpick. They had quite the selection it was so hard to choose! Examples include (note that all of these more or less were on bread): brie and marinara sauce, fried egg, various meats, shrimp and avocado, spinach pastry, and many more. We also had a glass of wine to go with our food. I was very impressed, and seeing as I love trying new things especially when I am in a foreign country, this was perfect!I have recommended this place to my friend who is moving to Barcelona tomorrow. If I come back to Barcelona, which I plan to one day, I will definitely return to this little gem.",
