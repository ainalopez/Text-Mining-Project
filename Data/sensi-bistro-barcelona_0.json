    "Sensi means a teacher, and the name fits right. This place is surely a teacher telling one how to enjoy excellent food.Beautifully historic from outside and located in the Gothic area but very contemporary from the inside makes this the perfect dinner place. As for the food, it was one dynamite of flavor after the next. Hands down our best tapas experience in Barcelona. The staff was very friendly and efficient. They speak English which helps for the tourists but other than that they are 100% authentic Spanish.The few highlights of food were the vegetable curry, a Thai twist to a Spanish tapa. The mini burger was just phenomenal.Do make resection sad it gets filled up fast. Though we didn't and luckily our wait time was only 10 mins but if you are on a time budget reservations will be a good call.Lastly don't skip the Caramel cheesecake. It was amazing and very different from the cheesecakes we often get here in US.",
