    "This is a dark and cozy tea spot tucked into one of the alleys in Barri Gothic. My husband and I showed up here to kill a little time before a tour we had scheduled. Nobody else was in there at the time but the guy running the place, so it must have been an off time. I had white tea (they were out of oolong, sadly) and my husband had a glass of wine. They also had a few snacks on the menu, but we had eaten not too long ago. Everything was quality, and the atmosphere was nice. I'd recommend it.",
