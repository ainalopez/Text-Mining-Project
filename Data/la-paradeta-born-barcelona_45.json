    "Best meal we had in Barcelona -- fresh, affortable, fun!Previous review has a good breakdown of the procedures, so I won't go into the details, but just start thinking about what you want as soon as the seafood in sight (when you're peering through the glass door). The listing of seafood (and prices) are on the door before you step in so get thinking sooner than later. When it's your turn and the pressure's on -- it can be tough to order, especially given the non-english speaking staff!!Unlike seafood bars in the states that serves food raw or boiled -- the preparation at La Paradeta depends on the type of seafood ordered. \u00a0Based on my order:--Mussels are either boiled or cooked in a tomato sauce -- your pick. \u00a0Tomato sauce was GREAT.--Conch shells are served raw with lemon. \u00a0Not my favorite.--Octopus are served grilled and with a green pesto like drizzle -- THE BEST -- a must order. \u00a0I think you can have them fried too.--Large Langoustine (Lobster-Shrimp mutants?) -- very pricey and not that tasty or meaty. \u00a0Grilled and drizzled with pesto.Total bill for what fed the two of us, including a 9 Euro bottle of white was under 60 Euro...what a steal!",
