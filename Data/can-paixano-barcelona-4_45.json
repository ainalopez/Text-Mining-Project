    "I don't know how I forgot to review this place. Of all the tapas bars my friend and I tried on our trip, this was easily the best. For under 30 euro, we ate and drank enough for four people. I'm not even kidding you, I couldn't eat until the next night. Honestly, I wasn't really sure what I was ordering - I speak English and French only, so I kind of stumbled through the menu, trying my best to avoid ham. (Without any luck - I had to pull it off and give it to my friend, but that's my own fault for having weird dietary restrictions.) I definitely recommend trying the sauces they have on the counter - I'm really not sure what they were, but they tasted good.My favorite part was standing at the counter, using my sparse knowledge of Spanish/Catalan to order another \"blanco\" or \"rosado\" and more tapas. I really felt like a local, especially considering we were the only tourists in the place. The portions were generous for the price, and I probably could have spent half as much money, and still been satiated. If you're in the area, I definitely suggest stopping by - just be aware that it gets packed during peak hours.",
