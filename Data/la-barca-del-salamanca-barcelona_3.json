    "Excellent food and excellent service BUT you do pay for it!We look this up on yelp in the airport before boarding our flight to Barcelona. We looked at the table length platter of seafood the entire flight to Barcelona, talked about it the entire flight and looked at the pictures. We said that was the first thing that we were going to do when we landed. We landed at 7 AM, taxicab bed it to the hotel, dropped our stuff off at the hotel, walked around a little bit and then went straight to the restaurant.We were the first ones there to eat, we were brought over and shown all of the first seafood that it was there. Beware of the barnacles (percebes)! \u00a0They are delicious but we spent \u20ac90 on them. We ate and ate and ate and ate. They brought us dessert with a bottle of grapas on the house. We really needed that grapas when we got the bill. Everything's market price and nobody told us what everything cost. We spent \u20ac250 on this meal! And that was for lunch! This was when the dollar to euro was $1.30!",
