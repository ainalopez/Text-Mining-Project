    "Spent a week in Barcelona in Feb 2016. \u00a0Ate here twice and my only regret for the trip is that we didn't eat here another time.Great service. \u00a0I mean Didac should be training others to work the front of the house.Food is really awesome. \u00a0We ate at many highly recommended tapas bars in Barcelona while we were there. \u00a0Some were good, but none had food like Etapes. \u00a0Food, like a good concert, should harmonize across the plates. \u00a0Each plate at Etapes built on the next and the meal was combined with great wines.The lamb shank, duck raviolis, scallops and cannelloni are all worth a return trip to Barcelona. I'd skip the paella, mostly because I'm just not a paella fan. \u00a0My wife ordered it, and while it was good (probably the best I've ever had), I thought the other dishes were superior.",
