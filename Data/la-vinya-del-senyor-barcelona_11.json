    "Great wine knowledge which was amazing due to their extensive wine list. Employees were friendly and pretty entertaining. I love the spiral staircase and wine written under the stairs and on the mirrors. Beautiful on the outside as well. The owner also has a wine shop around the corner that is jaw dropping. We sat at the bar and ordered some chorizo, tuna with almonds, grilled veggies, and the small bites. All very very tasty! They even gave us great recommendations for other places to visit while we were in town. Perfect place for people watching, too!",
