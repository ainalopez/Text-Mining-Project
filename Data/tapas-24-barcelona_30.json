    "The line seem so long at 8pm on Monday but surprisingly we only waited for 25 minutes. \u00a0 We sat at the bar facing the semi-open kitchen which was great to see the chefs prepared the dishes. \u00a0All of the tapas we had were not heavy at all so after 7 tapas we are not stuffed and comfortably full. \u00a01) The full body red wine was robust and at 4 euro a glass it was very reasonable.2) Bikini sandwich was to die for with its grilled panini, warm ham and fragrant truffle.3) Foie gras burger was cooked a good medium rare with a foie gras paste that was not too rich.4) Steak tartare was marinated to \u00a0perfection5) Deep fried red moll (red-skin fish) were lightly battered and the meat was extremely fresh and soft6) Grilled lamb skewer was not spicy and not gamey with a nice charred taste7) Spanish omelet with cured ham was not heavy at all. The omelet was made with very thin egg wrapping with potato cubes inside. \u00a08) Chocolate with olive oil was a mousse and if you love chocolate like me then you need to get it.",
