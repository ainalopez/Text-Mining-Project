    "A brightly decorated restaurant with novel interpretations of traditional tapas. Perfect execution, very friendly service. Slightly out of the way location but that means it is filled with locals, not tourists. Food: the squid ink croquettes were the best I've had. The hanger steak was perfectly prepared and flavorful. Fried zucchini flower was delicious! Cheesecake with passion fruit was out of this world. Service: helpful, friendly, not rushedWould definitely return here another day.",
