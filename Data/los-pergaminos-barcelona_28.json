    "Los Pergaminos means 'the scrolls' in Spanish. \u00a0We passed this restaurant many a time in our wanderings around Barcelona. \u00a0One night we were craving paella but then it was too late to eat it since most places serve it at certain times. \u00a0So we tried again the following night for a different place and found out that it was closed on Sundays. \u00a0Just our luck. \u00a0Enter Los Pergaminos. \u00a0We had passed by previously and noted the menu board outside. \u00a0They had paella until 10:30pm. \u00a0We walked in. \u00a0The decor is dark and dusty like pirate scrolls. \u00a0We ordered sangria, duck foie gras stuffed figs, shrimp in garlic butter, and mixed paella. \u00a0Let me just tell you, the duck foie stuffed figs are AMAZING. \u00a0I want to retire somewhere and pop those little babies all day long. \u00a0Yes, please. \u00a0The shrimp in garlic butter was good too. \u00a0We had to ask for bread just to dip it into the garlic butter sauce. \u00a0So good. \u00a0The paella is for a minimum of 2 people. \u00a0They won't make it for one. \u00a0Well they might if you just happen to be two strangers in a restaurant wanting the same thing. \u00a0But then you'd have to sit together and I digress. \u00a0The paella was really good. \u00a0There was a decent amount of crunchiness and softness to the rice. \u00a0The mussels were actually not fishy! \u00a0The chicken was cut into large chunks. \u00a0The shrimp was perfectly cooked. \u00a0The calamari rings were tender. \u00a0I'm not sure there was any rabbit involved but if it was there, I couldn't tell. \u00a0I was a happy girl. \u00a0All I wanted to eat in Spain was paella and I got my wish. \u00a0Ok, I know paella is from Valencia, but don't ruin this for me! \u00a0I loved it. \u00a0That said, I would venture back to Valencia anytime if you want to show me your favorite paella place. \u00a0We had excellent service. \u00a0The host and servers spoke a decent amount of English, albeit with a sexy accent. \u00a0If anything, come for the duck foie stuffed figs, but stay for the paella. \u00a0*drool*",
