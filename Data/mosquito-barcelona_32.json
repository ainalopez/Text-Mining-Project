    "As a tourist from US, my wife and I were looking for a local place to enjoy Asian Fusion as recommended by Yelp. \u00a0It's in a good area. \u00a0Don't wear anything above jeans/t-shirt/sneakers. \u00a0It's only a dum sum menu and prices are very reasonable. \u00a0We ordered a lot of food for 2 people and spent around \u20ac40 total. \u00a0Tasty food. \u00a0A hole in the wall place and food is plentiful with speedy service. \u00a0Get some hot sauce because you'll need it. \u00a0Come without AmEx because they don't accept it (much like most of Barcelona...not that I blame them).",
