    "Was there last night. Food was good and reasonably priced. We were starving and of course, ordered too many tapas. A few minutes later I asked the waiter if there was any way to cancel a few of them for we had ordered too quickly and without thinking and I hate to waste food. In some places one is able to do this since tapas come out a couple at a time and you are able to gage your intake. Not here. All of it came out at once. But overall is was worth it. The spicy sausage was just that: spicy, a tad oily but very good. The tortilla was excellent. Nice and thick. On the other hand the fried calamari tasted burned and the salad was a bit tasteless. And so I would give the food an overall rating of 2 1/2 stars. The rating goes up thanks to the wine and service. Here's the deal: If you read the other reviews you will note that this place attracts a young and boisterous crowd. This my friends is an understatement. After we ordered and the wine came served by an English speaking waiter (which made my non-Spanish friend very happy) a group of 54 French futbol fans showed up. 54, not a typo. Holy crap. You would think that Catalu\u00f1a had gained their independence and the French were taking credit. They sang and chanted in every language under the EU flag for the rest of our meal. Tables of older adults ran out like rats on the Titanic and if I hadn't been so hungry I would have jumped ship myself. But the wine was poured and like I said, I hate waste. The waiters apologized left and right and on our way out gave us a bottle of Prosecco as a parting gift. A nice touch. My experience: the meal was good, the crowd was too young for me but the service was divine.",
