    "This place was within a few blocks of our apartment, which makes a return visit easy. It is on a corner, with 5-6 tables out front, seats at the bar, a couple of high tables and some low ones. The walls are lined with wine bottles, the lighting eclectic and bright enough to see the food, and the music was mostly Motown while we were there. The waiters were happy to explain as much as we asked in English, and we tried to read and use as much Catalan and Spanish as we could.I am not a gastronome, so the fact that, to me, the food was creative, exciting, flavorful might not meet the standard of a professional foodie. Too bad for the foodie!We had the razor clams, which kept the briny taste of the sea. We had mini-burgers of waygu beef but then came a plate of seasoned but crisp cooked vegetables in a potato foam peppered with black quinoa, and a chicken cannelloni in a sauce flavored with foie and truffle oil, accompanied by a few crisp saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. We had enough room to share 2 desserts - butter cookie ice cream (as delicious as it sounds) and a cheery \"toast\" on which sat an iced apricot shell, which when cracked released an apricot cream as yellow as egg yolk, onto the toast. Breakfast food was never so good. One of the better meals I have had in recent years.",
