    "I came in for lunch as I was looking for a restaurant with more diverse menu. It was a great choice. They offer a lot of different dishes including vegetarian.It is perfect for people staying in Barcelona for a longer time, who got a little too much of tapas already ;DI had grilled calamari with asparagus and saut\u00e9ed veggies. It was delicious. Their bread is very good too, which is something I did't encounter too many times in Barcelona. Maybe just bad luck.The decor is very interesting and goes well with the vibrant atmosphere of the place. The only thing I could complain about is waiting too much for the service, but that's understandable if you have so many guests. I think they could use two extra people, because I was feeling tired by only looking at those waiters running around. Thumbs up for keeping the smile on your face at all times, I would be dying somewhere in the corner after working so much probably. :)",
