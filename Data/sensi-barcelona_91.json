    "I have been visiting a lot of tapas bars/restaurants in Barcelona. In Born, Gotic and Raval there are a lot of hidden spots whom deserves a visit. Sensi, is one of them.I will start with the food. The tapas is excellent. A lot of creative tapas dishes. They have mixed the traditional spanish tapas with very tasty tapas from the far east and gourmet tapas from the catalan kitchen. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice. It` s a small restaurant with few tables (10-15), and the music is chill. So it makes you relaxed and in the right mood to enjoy your food and have a nice time with your friends.The staff here are very cool (and proffesional). They are helpfull and knows the menu in and out. You get the feeling that they enjoy their job, and they are there for you.Since it is a pretty small and popular restaurant you have to book a table up front (even off season).The prices are very cheap. Went out with my girl and a friend. We ate a lot, 12 tapas and drank at least 12 units of alcohol. The bill was just 85 euros. We had to ask if they had missed something, they had not.",
