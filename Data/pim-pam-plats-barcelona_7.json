    "Yum! This place is great. They have a good variety of burger options (cheeses, bacons, etc) which were all tasty and cooked to order. The patty had bite, great flavor, and was moist. The bun was also delicious.In addition to burgers they also have a huge case of prepared foods. Everything from pasta salads to meatballs to potatoes. They are all priced by weight and you can get them to go or they can heat it up for you to stay. Looked like a lot of locals came here to pick up lunch on the go.Staff was slightly indifferent but it was also busy.",
