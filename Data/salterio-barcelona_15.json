    "Hidden in the Barri you may stumble upon this place. Salterio is tucked away in the old swelling brick buildings that make up the Barri. You could quickly walk pass it and not even notice. Luckily for us, we were hunting for a cafe to have tea at the time and were intrigued by the dim-lit lights in the cozy space. The cafe serves Turkish coffee and treats as well as a variety of loose leaf teas, herbal infusions and a few plates of food; one we overheard was crepes. The paper and cloth light fixtures pare well with the old brick wall and low sitting tables and chairs. My friend and myself shared a nice pot of Darjeeling tea. The tea was hot and sweet. Usually I drink coffee, but it was already around 8 o'clock and I didn't need the caffeine. But our neighbor sitting next to us was poured a cup of Turkish coffee that looked fantastic. In the end, the pot of tea cost us 5 euros, and will an \"adeu\" we were out the door. I recommend this cafe if you're feeling a bit bohemian and want to try something different.",
