    "For the unbeatable classic Catalan meal, do yourself a favor and stop here. Right near the University of Barcelona, this remarkable little restaurant is well worth your time and money. I stepped up to this little place for the first time on Valentines Day after many friends had recommended it to me, and for the rest of my six months stay in Barcelona I frequented it more times than I can count. The restaurant has outside, downstairs, and upstairs seating. It was almost always packed with a wait, so come prepared to eat either at a non traditional Spanish time or expect to wait. The staff is hilarious, and really friendly for the most part. I tried at least fifteen different things on the menu, and not one thing was disappointing. It's delicious, beautifully presented, well made typical Catalan food. My suggestion is to come with a group, or if your with just one, order lots of tapas to share. They are good size and not badly priced.Some of my favorites and must haves: Sangria Cava. Their regular Sangria is also delicious, but this was my favorite Cava version I had tried. Bocadilla de francesa (baguette with warm scrambled eggs and cheese mmmm) and the bacon, cheese, and dates bocodilla are both my favorites, and only 4 euros. Best bocadillos in Barcelona that I found. The goat cheese and vegetable tapa was a favorite of mine, and their jamon with bread and oil is one of my favorites in the city. If you have any aversion or doubts about the Spanish ham, this place will silence them all. Delicious. \u00a0Whenever someone was coming to visit me, I'd take them here to give them the true \"Catalan\" dining experience. It's a beautiful, delicious, and fabulous place!",
