    "7 Portes was a great experience. \u00a0There were no reservations left for the day so we came by and waited and were sat within 20 minutes. \u00a0It was a Tuesday, though, so I imagine it would be longer nearer the weekend. \u00a0The service staff was great, they only forgot to bring our wine, but they fixed it quickly. \u00a0The food was incredible. \u00a0I was adamant that I would not try the Sea Snails, but the table ordered them anyway. \u00a0I ended up eating 5 or 6 of them...incredible. \u00a0We also shared the Tuna Tartare with avocado which was a daily special and it was very fresh and delicious. \u00a0Two of us ordered the plate of grilled fish and everything was prepared perfectly. \u00a0I ordered the Canalons 7 Portes and was not disappointed. \u00a0The meat flavor made me so happy, I wanted to order another plate but refrained. \u00a0The least incredible dish was the seafood paella which still wasn't bad. \u00a0We ate most of it and the seafood in it was great.We sat at a table that Gabriel Garcia Marquez sat at. \u00a0I would definitely recommend a visit to 7 Portes if you have the money, it isn't cheap. \u00a0You will be dining in a restaurant that is a historical fixture of Barcelona. \u00a0It's more than just good food, it's an experience. \u00a0Enjoy!",
