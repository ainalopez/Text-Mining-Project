    "Very cool place but be careful with American credit cards as they may not work. \u00a0The idea of an ordering system based on a terminal is interesting. \u00a0The food was actually pretty good we had the noodles and sushi and both were fresh and tasteful. \u00a0Worth a visit if you are looking for different in Barcelona.",
