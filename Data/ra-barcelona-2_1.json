    "Quite possibly the most delicious food I've had outside of my wife's kitchen. The pear with cheese salad was absolutely incredible with the salty, sweet flavors juxtaposed in a beautifully presented dish. Everything we ate was amazing and there was something on the menu for every taste. Tucked away but close to La Rambla and Plaza Catalunya. \u00a0Can't say enough about how great this place was.",
