    "Lovely peruvian food right near the beach that had many options for a vegan like myself! Staff was wonderful with a great & chill vibe! We came back twice on our weekend stay in Barcelona which says a lot!! You could tell the crowd was mixed with a lot of regulars that was just enjoying their espresso to a bigger posse of exchange students that was enjoying drinks & sharing nachos as a starter. Very nice autmosphere with good music & nice interior. I recommend everybody to pay this place a visit! I will be back for sure!",
