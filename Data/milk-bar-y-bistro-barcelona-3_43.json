    "Nice balance between American and European breakfast! It was a toss up between the milk fry up and the eggs Benedict for my favorite dish but everything we ordered was great! Cappuccino was spot on and a lot of other customers ordering the fresh orange juice and smoothies but we did not try. Place is small as similar to other type of restaurants in the area but probably 6-8 tables so wait time not too bad.",
