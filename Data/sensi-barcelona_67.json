    "Visit Barcelona with my honey the past few days and was told they had the best tapas in barca! \u00a0Couldn't agree more. The cheesy spicy potatoes are to die for and the sea bass ceviche was incredibly fresh! \u00a0Everything was so yummy here and the atmosphere was great! \u00a0We went two nights in a row, that's how great it was!! \u00a0Salmon croquettes are a must try! \u00a0And if you're vegetarian, that's fine, so am I and I left full! The dessert menu doesn't offer an extensive collection of delectable treats, but, do try the cheesecake. It's amazing!!!!! \u00a0Ohhh Barcelona, take me back.. \u00a0I want to eat at Sensi.. Oh! Before I finish this review, MAKE SURE TO MAKE A RESERVATION at least an hour ahead of time! The place \u00a0is jumping and it's small, there are only about 15-20 tables there. We saw many people get told to come back in an hour! The music is loud and fun. They give you a small loaf of chopped bread, try not to eat all of it while your waiting for a dish to come! Sip your water instead and save room for other foods!",
