    "A rather unassuming bar in trendy El Born, Creps al Born turns out to be a knight in shining armor in the emerging BCN 'craft' cocktail trend.Mostly thanks to Argentinian Juan (Think Mr Brainwash) who has brought his South American 'mad scientist' vibe to this cozy food & drink bar a couple clicks down from El Born CC, locals & foreigners alike will love the experience. Sadly we only discovered it on our last night, and totally by happenstance, it actually became our favorite drinking experience during our BCN visit...mostly due to the spirited conversation based on Juan's detailed knowledge of spirits and thirst for experimentation. They also offer one of the deepest spirits selection in town so if you're graving a certain type of gin, rum, tequila, mescal, etc., they probably have it. Averaging \u20ac9 per craft cocktail, a good value for these quality drinks! So don't be shy...grab a stool at the bar, ask for Juan, and let your adventure begin...",
