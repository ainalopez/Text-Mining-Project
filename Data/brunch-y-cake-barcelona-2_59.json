    "We waited for more than 30 mins. But every single second of wait was all worth it! I had salmon benedict, it was well presented and melted in my mouth. \u00a0My friends were also very happy with their meal. Of course, \u00a0we had to eat an oreo cake! The experience was absolutely great.The place is tiny but adorable. I'm so happy we found this while in Barcelona.",
