    "Fantastic little place in the Barri Gotic. \u00a0Choose from three tasting menus at different prices. \u00a0Portions are small, but incredible. \u00a0Our waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful with the menu. \u00a0Offered substitutions to items we didn't like and suggested an excellent wine. \u00a0Don't miss a chance to experience this food!",
