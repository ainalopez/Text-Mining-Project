    "The food tasted excellent here. The place is always busy but service was a bit lacking. The servers seemed cold and not interested in serving us. We ordered the spicy shrimp tagliatelle and seafood rice (paella). Both were wonderful. However when we ordered the server asks if we wanted bread and we responded yes. Later to find out there was a charge of \u20ac1.10 per person for bread. And they cleared the table of the bread before we had finished! Watch out for this in most places. Nothing is free!The food was fresh though and tasted great.",
