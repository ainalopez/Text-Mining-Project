    "I'm no vegetarian. That being said I loved the food here. Super yummy with so many varieties and options. I got the meal deal which comes with a burger, patatas bravas and a drink for 9\u20ac? I was so stuffed I couldn't even finish everything. Large portion sizes, yummy food, great service.",
