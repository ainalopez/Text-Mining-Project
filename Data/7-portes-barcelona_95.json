    "What makes this place so cool to dine at was the fact that the restaurant is so so old 1836 which is 175 yrs old. This place is filled with rich history all around the room on the walls behind the seats are famous diners names from movie stars, artist, to presidents. They offer 7 main dining areas plus many private roomsThey are famous for Paella which we ordered and happy to say they lived up to their reputation. I cant say it was the best I've every had but it certainly hits all the key flavours and was easy to eat cause we ordered the boneless version for only a couple of euros more.This is a must reservation restaurant which I did on line very easily, they responded to my request \u00a0within a few hours.",
