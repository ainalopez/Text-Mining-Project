    "You'll love this place if you're an average tourist. The food is geared towards the American palate. If you're terrified of foreign food but want to feel like you've experienced Spain, go ahead and make a reservation here. The food isn't bad. The waitstaff speak great english and are extremely friendly. However, it can't even begin to compare to the food I had at other tapas restaurants in Barcelona. The dessert was the only standout here, it was very very good. But the octopus was a bit too chewy and really wasn't special. The lamb was great by American standards but again, couldn't hold a candle to the authentic dishes I had at other places. So it really depends on your expectations. Also there was loud American club-style music playing in the restaurant which was a little weird and off-putting. It was hard to relax and enjoy our meal when we felt like we should be doing shots under a strobe-light.",
