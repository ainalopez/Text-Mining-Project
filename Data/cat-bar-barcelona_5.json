    "I am a cat person. I am a burger person. I am a fries person. I am, however, not a vegan person.BUT!Tucked down a small street in lovely old Barca, this place managed to win me over...and not just with the free wifi. Cat Bar had one of the best vegan/vegetarian burgers I've ever tasted. I had the champion burger, which was only 6.50 EUR and hu-u-u-u-ge. While it didn't taste like meat per se (usually one of my requirements for a good veggie burger), it was enormously flavorful and satisfying. My friends and I also shared the potatoes, which came with spicy brava sauce that we also loved.You have to like their Facebook page in order to get the free wifi, which definitely raised a few eyebrows when this came up on my friends' newsfeeds. Their posts, however, are wildly entertaining. I have not unliked them to this day.",
