    "Kiosko Universal is one of those spots that is always packed and gets great shout outs in the Barcelona guidebooks, so be prepared for a wait. As others have already said, the food is very fresh. We shared the mixed seafood and mixed vegetables and enjoyed them, but felt like for the price, we could've done better. However, the staff was friendly and helpful, and in an area of overpriced tourist traps, maybe Kiosko Universal is as good as it gets.",
