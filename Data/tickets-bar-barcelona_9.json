    "A must while in Barcelona!! This ranked restaurant is a creation of the Adria brothers (of elBulli fame). We made reservations far in advance in anticipation of the food (as we were traveling on honeymoon) at midnight exactly sixty days prior. No regrets.The husband and I were seated in front of the kitchen (with a prime view of food prep) and opted to order a la carte. We started with the house beer (which was just okay) and began our food journey. Ham and cheese croquettes: tasty. Small portion.,Raw oysters: fresh and delicious.Chicken over chicken skin: chicken was so tender and juicy and paired well with the extra crispy skin.Pork belly brioche: out of this world good. Melted in your mouth.Chicken in mole: so flavorful.Razor clams: so-so but inventive. Not a favorite. Stone crab: good but not worth the work.Iberico ham with air bread: light and tasty. When in Spain, Iberico.Mango cannelloni: this dessert was foodgasmic with beautiful textures and flavors.Black currant meringues: tasty and very delicate. in flavor and texture.The worms: lovely presentation in a flower pot.The tickets cone: a MUST. Wheeled out on an ice-cream cart and composed in front of you with a \"newspaper\" cone (printed with an article about Tickets). Magical.The dishes, or tapas, here are finely crafted and beautifully presented in a kitschy manner. The interior and exterior are just as kitschy but perfectly embody the Tickets theme. In addition, the pricing is appropriate given the quality of the food - our dinner cost less than 125 euros and we were satiated.Highly recommended for a fun dining experience. No need to be dressed to the nines either. Three thumbs up!",
