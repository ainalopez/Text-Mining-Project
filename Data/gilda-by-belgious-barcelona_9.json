    "My boyfriend and I were staying very close by to this glorious restaurant. \u00a0We looked it up on Yelp and it had excellent reviews. \u00a0We were there the first week in June so things had not gotten really busy in Barcelona yet. \u00a0We had no reservations but it was a weekday. \u00a0No problem getting seated and we got our drinks right away. \u00a0Fabulous drinks no skimping. I don't remember what my boyfriend had but I do remember we had the meatballs as apetizers, croquetas and as my main course I had the lamb. \u00a0 \u00a0I was sucking on the bone much to my embarrasment! OMG it was the absolute best lamb I have had in my life. \u00a0I have beeen to many,many 5 star restaurants in my life and Gilda is by far the best meal I had in Barcelona. \u00a0And we honestly ate our way through the city the 7 days we were there. If you want unbelieveably good food do yourself a favor go to Gilda!",
