    "Looking for fresh seafood? Well this is definitely the place and best alternative if you want to skip the first-class restaurant and server! We stumbled on this restaurant when we were strolling on a long midnight walk in Barcelona. There is nothing extravagant or complicated about this restaurant. It's pretty simple if \u00a0your looking for great seafood! You can eat fresh seafood for an affordable price without the fancy fees. Try to get there as soon as the doors open because the line gets long quick.When you first enter Peix d'Or, \u00a0which translates \u00a0(Golden Fish) you will have to first check the fresh seafood out. Then choose what you want, along with drinks and pay. After, you will grab a seat at one of the tables and wait until they call your number. There is no server, \u00a0so you will have to serve yourself. So enjoy!",
