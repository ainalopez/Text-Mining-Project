    "Granted, this was my first true tapas bar experience, so I was really impressed, but after having been to more, it still tops my list as one of the best. The food was incredibly fresh, tasted amazing, and they had some truly excellent and adventurous options. Service was quick and friendly. They even accommodated our group of 10 without a reservation.We got there around 7:30 and were among the only customers there. When we left at 9:15, it was packed.Would definitely go back!Only \u20ac1,65 per toothpick. A bit more than most places, but absolutely worth the difference.",
