    "Giving the benefit of the doubt because I loved my meal (Canelons de la Fonda Europa de Granollers) and the service was great. I was visiting the city on a business trip and came to this restaurant with friends (locals) who made correct recommendation for me... otherwise would not have ordered what I did. \"Interesting\" (in a good way) location/ambience. Would recommend.",
