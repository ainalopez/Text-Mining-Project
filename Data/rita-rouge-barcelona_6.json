    "After bumping into many tourist traps on my first trip to Barcelona finding Rita Rouge was a great relief. Obviously anything on La Rambla is bound to be risky business when it comes to quality, but veer just a couple of blocks from it and you will find find Rita Rouge.From the outside it looks quite plain especially since it is positioned just opposite a parking place and next to a small road with heavy scooter traffic. But as soon as you enter the dark red colors will embrace you. You can actually enter from either side of the building and walk right through it, but before you leave, I highly recommend you sit down for a delicious ch\u00e8vre sallad, which was my absolute favorite!Should you feel a bit thirsty you should go have a chat with the friendly (at the time at least) bartender and order some of his suggestions and if you like a good Bloody Mary I can recommend that too.My opinion might be a bit biased due to the plethora of bad tapas and paella joints I had visited before this, but perhaps if you have made the same mistakes, coming here will make it all a bit better. I actually ended up going here several times during my stay, better safe then sorry aye?",
