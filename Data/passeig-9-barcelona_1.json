    "We came here on a Saturday night around 9:30pm and were not impressed. \u00a0Both the dishes and service were mediocre. \u00a0This place is a tourist trap (as evidenced by the Cyndi Lauper playing on the speakers, menus in English, and guests speaking English).We asked the waiter for tapas recommendations and he seemed to direct us to the more expensive dishes, which we found annoying. We ultimately settled on the following:- Assorted varieties of cured meat (ok)- patatas bravas (very good - my favorite)- grilled shrimp (boring)- bread with tomato (good, but basic)- grilled octopus with potato (ok)We also each had a glass of Rioja wine, which was good.The waiter never came to check up on us until very late into the meal.Overall, this place was disappointing and we wouldn't recommend it.",
