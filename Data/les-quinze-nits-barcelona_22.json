    "Let me start this review by saying that EVERY SINGLE person I spoke to prior to going to Barcelona raved about this place and told me to come. I really did not like it. It was the worst meal I ate while here. We ordered 2 salads to start (the only good part of the meal.. and it was very tasty), guacamole, bread and butter (you pay for everything.. so this you pay for too), paella for 2, and maybe 1 other dish that I might be forgetting. TIPS: -The salad with the goat cheese was good, get it. -My bf had a house salad, I believe. He enjoyed it. -SKIP the guacamole. It literally is a PILE of bagged nachos on top of a scoop of baby-food-pureed guacamole. We told the waitress that the nachos came but the guacamole never came out and she said \"it's under the chips\"... we wish we never found it. -SKIP THE PAELLA!!! This truly was the worst paella I've ever had. I probably should have realized by the intense brown color when it came out. In all fairness, my boyfriend did not think it was bad... not good.. but definitely didn't have the same reaction to it that I did, but I really, really did not like it at all. The restaurant itself is beautiful and comfortable. It's located in a square of restaurants. There's a line to get in (literally you line up single file in the square), but it moves pretty quickly. We went after the Barcelona-Malaga soccer game and waited maybe 30 minutes, but it was late. Overall, I would definitely skip this restaurant for something else.",
