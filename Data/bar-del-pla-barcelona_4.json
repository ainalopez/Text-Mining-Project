    "Warning: Do not be fooled by the 4 star rating. By far, one of the WORST tapas restaurants during my trip in Barcelona. Let me break it down... 1. There is an air of arrogance with the staff right when you walk in. As it is a popular place, the staff know they do not have to provide good service to their customers. Makes sense if their food made up for it. 2. Their food does not make up for it. Ordered the pan con tomate, house salad, potatoes bravas and seafood platter..all a lazy and poor showing of classic tapas dishes. 3. Once again, absolutely terrible service...If you're lucky, you will avoid this place. There are plenty of other places to enjoy while you're in the city.",
