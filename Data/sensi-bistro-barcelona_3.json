    "We went to several tapas bars during our visit to Barcelona, and this was my favorite one by far! Everything was so delicious, and I loved the atmosphere!We went for dinner without any reservations, so the wait was about 30 minutes to be seated. It's a small restaurant, and it's very popular, so the wait was definitely expected.When we were finally seated, the host was very nice and personable. He kindly seated us as soon as he was able, and we were promptly greeted by our servers. They explained to us the menu and gave us some great recommendations for our meal. We took many of their suggestions and were more than satisfied!My favorites were the Iberico ham and the ravioli, although everything we ordered was absolutely amazing! I left the restaurant completely stuffed and satisfied.After dinner, one of our servers gave us some suggestions for where to go out that night. He kindly took the time to write down some places for us to check out for Barcelona night life. It was overall an amazing experience. I absolutely loved it!",
