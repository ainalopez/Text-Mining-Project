    "1. The food was not worth the visit. Obviously the food was not bad, but for a new 2-star michelin establishment with buzz, we expected much better. Especially when compared to our other michelin-restaurant visits on this trip like el club Allard (Madrid), Paul Bocuse (Lyon), Regis et Jacques Marcon (Auvergne). Several dishes used the same sauces so wasn't that interesting and each course was just ok2. The presentation of each course was stale and not really impressive 3. The service was poor, our servers were overwhelmed and couldn't calmly or smoothly work the room. And at the end, I literally waited 15-20mins for the bill and it was very hard to get our servers attention.",
