    "Hip vegan joint. \u00a0Cat themed art within, so us cat lovers felt right at home. \u00a0Great selection of local beers. \u00a0Ample servings of really good food. \u00a0We shared a burger and hummus plate which was part of their rotating menu. \u00a0The side salad was good, the fries were amazing. \u00a0Free wifi. \u00a0Come in and get cozy!",
