    "I had heard all about this Tapas place and decided to check it out. It was difficult to get inside as it was so packed, but I was able to make it to the bar. I had never had tapas before so I told the server that and asked him what he would reccomend. From there he served me the house wine and 4 plates of tapas. I am honestly not real sure what tapas I ate, but all I know is that they were all exceptional. And the bill came out to less than \u20ac10. I would highly reccomend El Xampanyet, especially over the place across the street.",
