    "Bit unfriendly, or more uninterested staff but very nice food and good wine. Thought it was a bit unclear what they where trying to explain with regards to the portions and rounds but I think that the average table of two orders 4 - 5 dishes. For starters you can get half portions too. If you pick the tuna or salmon (carpaccio) I would go for a big portion though, we really enjoyed those. This place is a bit more expensive then average and it seems to be quite popular. Make reservations and count 40 - 75 euro a person.",
