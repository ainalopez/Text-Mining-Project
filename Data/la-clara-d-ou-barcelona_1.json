    "Spent 3 days in Barcelona. \u00a0This restaurant was by far the best. \u00a0I dined with my wife and two friends. \u00a0The food and service was outstanding. \u00a0The mozzarella with pesto was fresh, the veal and sirloin were tender, and the desserts superb. \u00a0I took business cards back to our hotel desk clerk so that he could direct others there.",
