    "Definitely have to sing the praises of this restaurant. First, as noted, on arrival you're invited to sample the house wine from the barrels, sort of ad infinitum... we were waiting for two more from our group, and definitely had a few generous glasses while we waited. The wine itself tastes a bit young (all of them), but cheap and cheerfully tasty.The ambiance is great, very rustic looking, all exposed wood and farm implements. It gets busy in the evenings, and the atmosphere is bustling. The food is again great. Not your typical Barcelona fare... specialties are meat. The rabbit, as noted, was very tasty with the onions. Catalan sausage, pork loin, etc. all very good. Service consistently excellent (been here twice over 2 years), and they are very patient and helpful with the odd tourist.Prices for mains roughly ~8 EUR, so very reasonable! It's a great place to check out if you're interested in slightly different fare than your usual barcelona seafood paella...",
