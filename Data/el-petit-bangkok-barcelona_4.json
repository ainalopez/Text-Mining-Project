    "Finally, we have authentic thai food in BCN! The location has changed, it's now located on c/ Vallirana. Call ahead for reservations, it's worth the wait! They offer several options for vegetarians and spice it up to your liking! It feels good to get the eyes and nose watering again after years of bland Barcelona thai food. The family that runs it offer family style hospitality and fresh authentic dishes in an open and fun environment.",
