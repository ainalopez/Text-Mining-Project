    "Brunch & Cake has a huge following among students who study abroad or visit Barcelona. And for good reason. It's delicious and would track towards the lighter, healthier side of brunch options most famously known for being the protein salad. However this is not to say they don't offer a wide arrange sweets which look spectacular. Great location and nice outdoor seating, although getting a reservation is difficult, but worth the wait.",
