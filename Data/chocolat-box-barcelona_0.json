    "Lots of gelato choices displayed in gorgeous fashion. \u00a0In a visit to Barcelona last spring we stayed about a 1-2 blocks from Chocolat-Box. \u00a0This quickly became our end of the night jaunt with the littles. \u00a0They got gelato (please do yourself a favor and try the nata flavor), and we got 3-4 euro bubbly to enjoy while they od'd on sugar.",
