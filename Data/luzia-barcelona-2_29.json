    "The food here was superb. \u00a0I'm from New York and eat plenty of Chinese food, both authentic and not - this food was of the extra-super-tasty but non-authentic variety. \u00a0There's kind of a slight Spanish fusion thing doing on, which adds some inspiration to the dishes and makes the whole thing more interesting.The decor was similarly fantastic - very tastefully done. \u00a0There were big communal tables for groups, but my girlfriend and I got half of one all to ourselves, so it also works for a romantic dinner.I'm reserving one star for two reasons:1) The food was very good and very tasty, but not... mind-blowing.2) Service was friendly, but poor in my experience. \u00a0Coming from NY I'm used to a faster pace so this how I felt most places in Barcelona; overall this place wasn't particularly egregious. Food came out fast enough, but we had to struggle to flag down someone to refill our drinks, and then again later to get the check.Overall, I recommend this place as a great restaurant right off the Rambla.",
