    "Loved this place. \u00a0Great twist on tapas. \u00a0I would recommend the ravioli artichoke, the goat cheese salad, duck timbale, and cheesecake dulce. \u00a0All were fantastic and reasonable prices too. \u00a0Busy on a Sunday night so would recommend making a reservation. \u00a0Casual dress was fine.",
