    "hard to rate this one. \u00a0I should've ordered the Italian dishes instead of the 'possible' fusion of Spanish dishes, though the staff were Spanish but suspect co-owners exist with Italian roots, who knows exactly but their intro in their menu somewhat explains it, but just too hungry to read carefully lolOrdered mushrooms & garlic and the seafood panella, which the rice actually the highlight. \u00a0 just one big crayfish, several mussels, lots of squid & baby shrimp, tasted fresh but nothing special.I would return because they apparently have the best meat lasagna: their restaurant name speaks for itself.friendly staff.cant believe they dont know what ginger ale is!",
