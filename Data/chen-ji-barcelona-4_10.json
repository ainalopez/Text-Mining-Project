    "I can't say enough about the food here. The food is very cheap, BUT very good authentic tic chinese food.We were visiting Barcelona and ate a lot of seafood, so we decided to get some Chinese. This place was highly rated, but through previous experiences in Europe Chinese food isn't very good overall. This is the exception.If you have a craving for Chinese food come check this place out. Highly recommended!",
