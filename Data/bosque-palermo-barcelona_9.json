    "Crappy service, and so-so paella.We got at the restaurant around 11 PM, and we knew it closed at midnight. We knew what we wanted, so no need to look at the menu. We got the mixed paella.We had a game plan: order quick, take a few bites, get the rest to go, and Netflix & chill at the hotel. It took 25+ minutes for us to get our paella, so that kinda altered our plans a little. We knew fresh paella would take at least 20 min to cook, but that extra 5 min seemed forever. We got the piping hot paella, and was disappointed. Frozen, salty seafood! Not fresh at all, the shrimp had that frozen taste to it. The pork was good tho, very tender. The rice had an almost curry taste to it. ALSO, how do we serve paella without a spoon?! Our waiter only gave us forks- but we didn't want to bother him for a serving spoon as he was too busy eating his dinner and smoking his cigarette. We are still on the hunt for a life-changing paella in this country.",
