    "AMAZING food! One of my favorite stops so far. We shared a pitcher of sangria that was delicious. We had some peppers stuffed with cheese. These were slightly sweet and very tasty. We also got a couple of tostas. We had an Iberia ham one that was delicious. We also had one called the sesamo that had aubergines, mushrooms and peppers on it. One of my favorites!!! The bar itself is small and is kind of cave like and has a bunch of eclectic decorations. I would highly recommend a stop by.",
