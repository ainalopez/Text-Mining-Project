    "I give this place 2.5 stars. We got in at 8-830pm and got a table quite quickly. It got packed around 9pm. We ordered a salad (fresh and basic), mixed grilled meat (my boyfriend really enjoyed this), and the paella mixta \u00a0(as other reviewers have stated... it was too salty. I was pretty disappointed as I was quite hyped by the reviews). We received the first 2 dishes quickly... then waited another 30 min after eating our first dishes for the paella. We saw 3 other tables receive their paella before us and they had arrived much later than us. The prices were really cheap. So I guess you get what you pay for. Also, don't get the house rose (rosada) wine... it was harsh. Pay extra and get non-house wine.",
