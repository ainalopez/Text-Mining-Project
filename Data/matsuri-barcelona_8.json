    "Yes, I know, Japanese restaurant in Barcelona, \u00a0there's something wrong with me. But being a true Asian I cannot stand more than a few days without rice or noodle, not even delicious Tapas can save me. I'm incurable. So I ended up here, solely to fulfill my noodle cravings. I ordered Yakisoba and my friend ordered Tom yum soup. To be fair this place is more like Asian fusion with an emphasis on Japanese food and decor. It's a lovely place, it's definitely not authentic, nor did I expected it to be. In the end I got what I needed, a stomach full of noodles. It wasn't bad, but \u00a0not very remarkable either. Good ambience for hanging out and dining with friends, staff were friendly too.",
