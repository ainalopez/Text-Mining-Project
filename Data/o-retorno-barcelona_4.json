    "Thumbs up to this local restaurant. The food is authentic Catalan for locals. Found it on Yelp near the hotel where we stay. Despite the language barrier, the lady owner \"refused\" to serve us the full portion that we asked for. In the end we were thankful to her because there would no way we could have finished the full portions of the octopus accompanied with potatoes and steamed mussels with olive oil seasoning. The half portions were already very generous. The bill for the two main courses, a big bottle of spring water and a pint of beer only came out as \u20ac28. We enjoyed the food and appreciate the honesty of the owner.",
