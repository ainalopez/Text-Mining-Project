    "Oh my. You would think that salmon eggs benedict on a sweet waffle would be just be a gimmick or a geegaw, a showy, purple-cow attention-seeking item you would see in East London that would close in 6 months, but they actually pull it off and even get the underlying basics of the benedict just...perfect.Be prepared to sit with a bunch of other, well, tourists speaking English without even trying their Spanish or Catalan. And be prepared for a long wait to be seated too, as well as 10% extra to be outside, but worth double that. If you're not sure, I would go with one of the egg dishes or the french toast, etc - the salads are probably just as tasty but just not as novel. Oh, one last thing on the menus- \u00a0they translate \"caffe con leche\" into \"latte\", etc in the English side of the menu (!). And the English menu is missing a rather reasonably-priced caffe americano. Always worth it to speak a few words of the local language..",
