    "This was the best food I had in Barcelona. The ingredients were excellent, good technique. Spinach salad with warm goat cheese, good Iberian ham, beef loin with foie gras (wow) and some rico potato bravas. Limited menu during off hours, but I can imagine that this place is annoying during the peak. You should go.",
