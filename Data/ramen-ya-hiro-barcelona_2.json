    "Let's just start out by saying that the wait was not pleasant. We arrived at 8:35 and got seated at 9:40. My friend and I ordered an order of gyoza, miso noodles with char siu roasted pork and chocolate mochi to finish. The gyoza was good. There were five pieces (4,50) served with a side of typical soy/sesame sauce. The gyoza peels were thin and the filling was very salty. They were cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of ginger in them. My miso soup base ramen (7,50 plus 2,50 for the pork) was the star. The soup base was at times, nutty but also super meaty and savory. The noodles were a bit subpar--nothing exciting--they were a bit too soft and lacked the elasticity that I look for in noodles. The char siu pork was pretty fantastic. It was tender and fell apart instantaneously upon the chopsticks touch. I ordered chocolate ice cream (3,00) to top off my experience. It was extremely rich and creamy--just what I needed! This place is good but I'm not sure if I'd wait in line for another hour to taste the broth again.",
