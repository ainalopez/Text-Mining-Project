    "No question this was the best meal we had in Barcelona and rivaled our top meals in Paris from our last trip.I'm not sure if it the tasting menu is the same price but when we went it was such a value at 65 euro/pp. \u00a0The dishes felt like they would never end and we were so stuffed but we kept wanting more. The menu changes seasonal but two standouts were the Duck Foie Gras Ravioli (still missing Foie in California, please come back). The other being one of the desserts that was Truffle Chocolate with a hint of real truffle taste. You have to try it, just amazing.Don't miss out and make sure to get reservations well in advance.",
