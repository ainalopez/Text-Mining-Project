    "My girlfriend and I originally came to this restaurant tonight for her b-day dinner. We didn't make a reservation because of last minute decision to choose this place based on reviews. I have to start off and say the hosts at this restaurant are the most friendly I've ever met. They were booked at this location and hooked us up with a last minute reservation at their other location at Carrer de Ganduxer. The host literally walked us to the corner and hailed a cab for us (this is unheard of in the states)...so friendly!We arrive at the second location and looks like a smaller version of the restaurant but still holds the same quality friendliness of the staff. \u00a0Although the menu is a little smaller at this location, my girlfriend doesn't eat red meat. They actually went out of their way to grill a salmon for her even though It wasn't on the menu! That was incredible from them. To top it off they also gave us a bottle of champagne on the house, and when we ordered desert they also put candles on it :) We were very impressed with the speed, friendliness, clean, sophisticated staff. Definitely recommend this to anyone who comes to Barcelona and wants a variety of great food! 5/5 well deserved!!!",
