    "Overloaded on jamon or just a desperate vegan looking for food in Barcelona? Cat Bar is a good choice for tourists and vegans being close to tourist attractions and serving only vegan food. They have specials including everyone's favorite menu del dia most days. Sunday's was \"roast beef\" seitan, with parnips & carrots, roasted potatoes, all very good with some very sad overcooked broccoli, the starters was a tomato soup and the meal ended with a very moist chocolate cake. They have good selection of beer. There is only one server and service is very laid back. The diners are a mix of tourists and some vegan locals. There is free wifi. They close very early at 9pm.It's a cheap place with everything 10 euro and under.",
