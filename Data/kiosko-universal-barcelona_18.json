    "Kiosko Universal(stall 691) is located inside the city's most famous market~ the Mercat de la Boqueria.It stands out as perennial local favorites for their home-cooked, authentically Catalonian flavors. Following are the items we ordered:1. \u00a0Tortilla Zucchini(Zucchini Omelet~ 3 Euros) A rounded 4\" fluffy omelet with cubes of roasted zucchini, a very simple yet flavorful dish, be sure to arrive before 10am, otherwise it might sell out. 2. Bacon Sandwich(4 Euros) Big slices of pan seared bacon in a traditional Catalonian bread(sliced baguette drizzled with olive oil and rubbed with fresh tomatoes). 3. Fried egg with mixed mushrooms(10 Euros) My favorite dish, mounts of varieties of mushrooms sauteed in a generous amount of olive oil, topped off with 2 deep fried over medium eggs and sprinkles of fleur de sel. 4. Razor Clam or Navaja(15 Euros), Razor clams look like long tubes with a shell on them. The texture is between clam and squid. This dish is simply prepared with olive oil, chopped parsley and drizzled with lemon juice. A must try dish!5. Espresso & Cafe Americano(1.5Euros), full of robust coffee flavor, most locals only drink their coffee black, but if you like cream, ask for \"con leche\" (with milk) since cream aren't available in most places.There were so many other wonderful dishes that I would love to try, just have to wait til the next time I visit Barcelona~",
