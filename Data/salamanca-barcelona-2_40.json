    "When we went, the downstairs part of the restaurant was only 1/2 full and only had tourists. We should have left then. We ordered the seafood paella, which came poorly reheated (the cast iron pan wasn't even hot) and several euros more expensive than the delicious paella we had elsewhere in Barcelona. The seafood was dried out and the sauce they had clearly thrown on when reheating wasn't mixed well, including one mussel shell that was just full of sauce. Then they had the nerve to charge up the soggy bread with tomatoes and greasy meat \"appetizer\" that we were given after being seated (that we didn't ask for; when we asked about it on our bill, we were told that it was all inclusive, yet had its own price).",
