    "This is not a place I'd expect to find tourists, and that's exactly what makes it special. \u00a0It's a no-frills restaurant that serves Catalan food. \u00a0The menu is quite large but it doesn't go into a lot of detail because it's assumed that everyone is familiar with the cuisine and knows what to expect. \u00a0You can get a wide variety of tapas to share, or main dishes, which always come with a big helping of potatoes, rice, or bread on the side even if it's not listed. I definitely recommend sticking with the tapas; a little bit of different things. \u00a0The entrees are ok but not amazing. \u00a0Same for the house wine; if you are particular about your wine, get a bottle of something specific (I'm actually not sure if they even have a wine menu).My favorite dish is the goat cheese salad, with a big round piece of cured chevre on top, nuts, and lots of greens, which is otherwise hard to find in Catalan cuisine. \u00a0It has outdoor seating in a quiet plaza which is a lovely way to spend an afternoon.Also, like many local places, it's hard to know what the hours are. \u00a0Their website says they close at 5, which means it's breakfast/lunch only, but I have eaten there late on a Saturday night so that's clearly not true every day (perhaps it's only open for dinner on Friday/Saturday). \u00a0You might want to call ahead to verify that they're open if you're making plans to eat there.",
