    "Without a doubt one of our worst dining experiences in Barcelona. Located in the heart of Barri Gothic, so it's convenient, popular and always filled to the gills. We went because it seemed to be a fixture among the young local scene and had such great reviews. What a mistake. The food is not cheap (45 euros per person) and the only prevailing flavor was an excessive amount of salt. It completely overwhelmed any other flavor. The salt rendering the food largely inedible, \u00a0plus the dirty bohemian vibe, poor service and tiny bottles of water made for a horrible experience. \u00a0There are plenty of gems in this area of barcelona. This qualifies 100% as a tourist trap. We ate the lentils, patas bravas, gazpacho and steak. All lacked any creativity or flavor other than salt. Cava was way over priced and it seemed a huge imposition to the wait staff that we requested a sleeve to keep it cold. ....sorry unlike most tourists. ...we don't enjoy warm, flat cava?....Try bar mundial or el bixto instead. We were generally very upset that we wasted one meal in Barcelona here.",
