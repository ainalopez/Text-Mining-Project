    "Tapeo was one of my favorite places to eat in Barcelona, and lucky for us, it was super close too! We came here for our first dinner when we got into town. It was about 10:30PM on Sunday and the place was full. We grabbed the last table opened and were greeted immediately. My husband ordered a beer and I had their sangria. His beer was delicious (they have an awesome tap/nitro system here!) and the sangria was the best I had yet. They had a few specials written up on the board and we decided to order a few specials and a few of their regular menu items. We decided on:- Iberian ham croquette- Pincho Murono (lamb with mint yoghurt)- Bread with tomato- Grilled Pulpo (one of their specials)Everything we ordered was seriously amazing. It was truly one of the best meals we had while in Spain. The service was prompt and the prices were reasonable. We came back a few nights later and had the pulpo and pincho murono again. Definitely a spot to dine at when in Barcelona! I can't wait to come back.",
