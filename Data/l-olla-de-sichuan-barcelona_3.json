    "Wanted a change in cuisine after being in Barcelona for 4 days. \u00a0 Came across this place quite by accident. \u00a0We were 4 adults and 2 kids. \u00a0Have to say - the food was way better than we expected. \u00a0The dandan noodles wee really good - but could have used more spice (my spice tolerance is extremely high). \u00a0There was a dish called spicy gofu (instead of tofu) - it was phenomenal. \u00a0So were the spicy crab legs. \u00a0Kids got shrimp fried rice and egg rolls - and polished it off. \u00a0Service was a bit slow - probably because it was a Tuesday night and they only had 2 waitstaff. \u00a0Both were super sweet - would definitely go again during this 10-day trip",
