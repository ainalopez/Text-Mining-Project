    "The lunch time deal of \u20ac5.50 for 5 tapas and a drink was perfect and just what I needed. I can't really tell you what things-on-bread I consumed but they were all delicious, some with generous slabs of excellent cheese. As far as value is concerned I think this was the best value meal I had in Barcelona. I would strongly recommend.",
