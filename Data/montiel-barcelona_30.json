    "I heard it's really hard to get a reservation here, but my colleague somehow worked his magic and got us a big table for a business dinner.Still can't get used to the fact that the Spanish start dinner around 9pm at the earliest. I heard the earliest Restaurante Montiel takes reservations is at 8:30pm! I've seen families with small children having dinner at midnight!!! What's going on here?Anyhoo, the food here is exceptional and the service is top notch. They were very helpful in explaining everything in detail, and all the courses came out together at the same time in a timely manner.The food - amazing. Very modern take on Spanish food. We had a prix fixe four course menu for 55 Euros which seems very reasonably priced.If you're into hip modern food, try this restaurant. If you want to explore traditional Spanish cuisine, stay away!",
