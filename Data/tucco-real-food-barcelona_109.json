    "Very nice dishes with reasonable price. I went there for my first dinner in Barcelona, and I was really happy to make this decision. Besides the nice dishes, the staffs were very welcoming and spoke English fluently. Highly recommend to those who want to try something tasted and home-made. Although it's situated in alley but the location is easy to find. Along with tasted pastas, Argentine pies were gorgeous, can't miss these in your order.",
