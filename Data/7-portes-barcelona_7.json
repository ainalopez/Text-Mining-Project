    "This was recommended to us as the \"oldest restaurant in Barcelona.\" Conveniently just around the corner from our hotel, we walked over and waited for a table (reservation is recommended.) \u00a0Every table is named after a famous person that has dined there... ours was the \"Lauren Bacall.\" My friend ordered the seafood soup (and didn't love it) and I ordered some sort of stuffed pasta (can't remember what they called it) and it was ok. The service was 5 star and the d\u00e9cor was beautiful!",
