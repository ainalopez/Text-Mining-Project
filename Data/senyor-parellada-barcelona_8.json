    "We tried to go there a couple of days ago based on good review from our guide book. It was full for the night so we booked our place for today at 8.30. We went there on time, there was a long waiting line but we were seated in couple of minutes then the rush began! A waiter who didnt speak any english nor french and i even doubt he speaks spanish came 3 times to take our order in 5 min. At the end we decided to share 1 starter and 1 one main course and some wine (we were two). Then 3 min later all the dishes came at the same time! We had to repeat 4 time we wanted to share the plates but the waiter couldnt get it at all. Such a disapointment. We would think we were in such a good restaurant but they couldnt even serve the starters before the main dish and they were in such a rush to us be finished before the next round of customer to come in and spend their money on this rubbish cuisine! I say rubbish because it tasted as hell and even our neighbour table asked for creme caramel and they got a half frozen desert!!!! Frozen!!! I tried to communicate my disatisfaction to the head waiter but got nothing but a 'thank you'!! We've been in barcelona for a week now and eaten in most of different places but this is the worst of the worst places we were in!! Such a shame for such a good name. Worst service, worst food!",
