    "Found this tapas bar on Yelp and was very pleased. \u00a0Service was very friendly and efficient. \u00a0Tapas can be ordered from menu or selected from trays of food sitting on bar. \u00a0Don't go crazy with the menu because the tapas on the bar are amazing! \u00a0Items are heated up as necessary after you put them on your plate and your bill is calculated by how many skewers you collect. \u00a0I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Barcelona.",
