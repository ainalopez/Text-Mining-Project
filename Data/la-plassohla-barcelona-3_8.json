    "This is a difficult review to write. If I had written it just after we had dinner there I would have written something like: This is an upscale tapas bar that serves good tapas that could be excellent if they tried a little harder (e.g. our veal was good but not spectacularly tender especially given that it was very rare). The service, however, was very friendly and excellent.But I write this review after recovering from a serious bout of food poisoning (that both my wife and I had about 24 hours after our visit there). With these things there is never certainty where you get them from but our biggest suspect have to be some razor clams that did not taste very fresh when we ate them there. We finished them nonetheless and had a terrible day afterwards (I spare you the details but it was not nice).That should not happen anywhere but even less in a place that seems so upmarket.",
