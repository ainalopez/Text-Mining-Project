    "I found out that I'm not a fan of most tapas bars or paella, and so finding excellent food in Barcelona quickly became a challenge for me. \u00a0Even worse - I prefer cook-to-order food and hot meals. \u00a0(I get it; I'm a high maintenance eater!)Gut was about a block and a half away from where I was staying and delicious! \u00a0I came in for a pre-fixe lunch that included bread service, water, a drink, soup, and a small lunch portion for 11 euros. \u00a0(Americans, bread and water do not come free with any meal in Barcelona.) \u00a0It was perfect! \u00a0The food was simply outstanding, and this was the first thing I gobbled up on the trip (and maybe the last!)The staff was very friendly and able to communicate in English with me. \u00a0The place was trendy, modern, small, and rather intimate. \u00a0It must be a local favorite because it was simply packed by the time we left (1pm?)I would highly recommend this place over MANY, MANY others in Barcelona. \u00a0It's sort of tucked away, but it is a gem!",
