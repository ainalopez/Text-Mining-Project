    "Ready to be a SashaLover?SashaBar is a new bar-restaurant in the neighborhood, and it is by far the most attractive place to go either for some drinks or to eat something.Their Menu is always improving and the chef is innovating every time and then. Ask to the waiter to recommend you something because depending on what they bought that day they might have an outstanding tuna dish not listed on the menu.GinTonics and imported beers are the best way to go if you are looking for a drink. Their bartenders are well trained, I can tell.I also know they offer vermouth on Sunday mornings and it has quite a success, but I've never tried.Give it a try, you'd thank me later ;)",
