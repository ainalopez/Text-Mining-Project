    "Delicious tapas and wines are served here at this lovely restaurant on my favorite street, Enric Granados. \u00a0My date was French, and well, he was in total luck because most of the staff speaks French there (along with English - and of course Spanish and Catalan). \u00a0I don't remember what the dish was called - but the Octopus (Pulpo) served on potato slices was incredibly delectable: cooked to tender perfection, salted perfectly and it was just all out excellent. \u00a0That was the only dish I remember, though we did have about 3 or for plates to share. \u00a0Prices were correct. \u00a0Service was friendly. \u00a0Definitely a great choice when strolling around the area and looking for a place to eat.",
