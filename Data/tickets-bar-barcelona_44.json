    "First of all the positive, the food was outstanding and the presentation eye popping. \u00a0No question at all about the quality of the food, tickets has it right. \u00a0The problem that we encountered was with the bill. \u00a0Before I get into that, I want to point out we are a Canadian couple living in Barcelona and we have not ever had a problem with overcharging or bad attitude generally until now. So in other words this is not a Barcelona restaurant issue generally, I suspect that perhaps the servers at tickets receive a commission on their food and beverage sales. \u00a0Anyway, onto the review. \u00a0We decided against the tasting menu and ordered a la carte, our server Alex seemed disappointed that we did not opt for the tasting menu but nonetheless accepted our order. \u00a0The first instruction we were given by Alex was that we could not order just one or two tapas/dishes at a time because the kitchen needed an order of no less than three to four starters as well as three to four regular (main) tapas. \u00a0Bit strange we thought as we have never been told about this rule at other restaurants, high end restaurant or not it seemed to be an attempt to hurry us along but okay we went along with it. We ordered the olives for a starter, the price being \u20ac2.20 on the menu and Alex brought us 4 olives without indicating this was a minimum order. If there was something on the menu that indicated a minimum order of olives or that they were priced per unit, it was pretty small print as we missed it. Then for every tapa we ordered he brought 2, which might be pretty normal for this restaurant but we would have thought you let the customer know your bringing two of each. \u00a0The price you see on the menu is \u20ac6.80 for a tapa and you think okay I'll share this tapa with my wife/husband/partner. \u00a0Nope Alex brough us 2 X tapas each time when we thought we ordered one and please note you will not necessarily notice this at the time as you don't think because there are two manchego cheese airbags on one plate that you will be charged twice the price you see on the menu. \u00a0We decided to try one of the \"special tapas\" which in English was \"aged beef\" priced at \u20ac14.00 on the menu, so we said to alex we would like to try this aged beef. \u00a0What happened next? \u00a0A chef came out and cooked up the beef in front of us, served it on a plate for us nice and hot and sliced perfectly. \u00a0The price? \u00a0Four times \u20ac14, you do the math, \u20ac56 on the bill. \u00a0The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9\u00b7sis\u00b7tance of this overcharging party was when Alex recommended dessert. \u00a0He said do you like strawberries, we said sure, you can choose a dessert with strawberries. \u00a0He then proceed to have his colleague prepare a strawberry salad tableside again, for a cost of \u20ac12.40. \u00a0Then he brought another desert, and another, and another, and another. \u00a0Even after we said that is enough food Alex, he said only two more to go. Desert cost approx. \u20ac50. \u00a0Now I know what your thinking, take charge and be assertive and tell him your not accepting any more food, call over the maitre'd and argue over the bill. \u00a0Sure could have done that but we were enjoying the night and it was not until we received the bill that we saw the damage, \u20ac216 euro for a few tapas and a few desserts and a few glasses of wine. \u00a0We decided to not get worked up right there and then and fix it later. \u00a0More to the point is the unnecessary pushing of the food to crank up the bill as much as possible and in a dishonest manner, tell your customers how it works so they can make an informed decision. If you do decide to go to tickets, enjoy the great food, but watch like a hawk with how that bill is going to add up outside of your awareness.",
