    "This is a great choice if you want to depart from the ever ubiquitous tapas. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. They also serve dinner when you want to eat (not 9PM like lots of other places in Barca). We had the t-bone and teriyaki chicken. Both were delicious. Decent prices on wine and food, solid dinner choice.",
