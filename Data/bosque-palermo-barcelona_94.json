    "As you tour through Spain and the rest of Europe, you'll come across many boards in front of restaurants with pictures of great looking food as well as men and women trying to usher you in to eat. \u00a0STAY AWAY!!! Always eat where the locals seem to populate and this restaurant is always filled throughout the night (and for good reason). \u00a0The paella here is wonderful. It is bright with flavor, a bit on the salty side but balanced well with lemon juice. \u00a0The seafood used in it is very fresh, too. It is only 9\u20ac per person and a ton of food per person. \u00a0If you want to go eat frozen paella at La Rambla for 14\u20ac be my guest but if you want the real deal, this is it. \u00a0Wash it down with some sangria (10\u20ac for a big pitcher) and try their Creme Catalan (2-3\u20ac), it is their local creme brulee and is a perfect ending to the meal!",
