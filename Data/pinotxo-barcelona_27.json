    "I think about this place allllllll the time. It's been more than a year since I ate here but I definitely think about the baby squid and white bean dish like it's my long lost love. I can't remember specifically the other dishes I had but they were all wonderful. They were all clean and simple and full of flavor.The service was also great. The man who served us was really friendly and attentive (and attractive!). Ha.The wait for a seat wasn't too bad. I hate hovering over people as they eat but that's pretty much the only way to secure one of the stools.Every time someone tells me they are going to Barcelona, I quickly run for pen and paper and jot down the info for Pinotxo and beg them to go there on my behalf.",
