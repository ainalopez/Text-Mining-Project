    "This place came recommended by our host. Since we love seafood, and this is Barcelona, seems to be a no-brainer to try. We came at around 930PM on Thursday nigiht, and the place was full, but not too bad, perhaps 10 minutes wait before we can place our order. It didn't feel like long, since were still trying to decide what to get.We mostly just point at things, and they know enough English to communicate (and recommend) quantities and style of cooking. Pulpitos/baby octupus, grilled with green sauce (next time try it fried)Razor clam, steamedGambas (large shrimp)Calamaries friedMussels, steamedI love every single one of the above, they are all so good! We added the garlic sauce, but I think marinara sauce might be better next time. We also ordered (and finished) a bottle of dry white wine. Honestly thought we were ordering 2 glasses, but then she popped open a whole bottle and slide it toward us lol, so we went ahead and finished the bottle. For 8 euro it was actually pretty good.Overall it cost us about 50E, and we were stuffed!",
