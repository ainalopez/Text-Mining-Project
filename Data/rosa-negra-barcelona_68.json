    "On the advice of other Yelp reviews, I came here on my search to find authentic Mexican food in Barcelona. I was very disappointed. I ordered a carne asada burrito and a Coronita aka a typical mexican lunch. For the price, the burrito was very small and not authentic Mexican at all. The meat & the tortilla itself were very bland... they basically put your ingredients in a flour tortilla & heat it up on a pan for a bit, apparently with no oil or anything. Also, the burrito had lettuce in it, was severely lacking in the amount of meat contained within & the salsa was not spicy at all... more signs that it's not authentic Mexican. An authentic Mexican burrito usually consists of a large portion of a flavorful meat, rice and/or beans... with minimal amounts of onion & cilantro. With all of that said, though, it was a decent burrito. But it would be more accurate to describe it as tex mex, baja, or a combination of the two. I probably won't be eating here again unless it's to come for their maragaritas & mojitos. If you're looking for an authentic Mexican experience in Barcelona, I recommend La Taqueria.",
