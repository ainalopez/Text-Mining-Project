    "Crepes perfection. Although it has become a chain, the one on Via Laietana has the best crepes made with the freshest ingredients and the finest touch ( the crepemaker is obsessed with quality and the diner's happiness).I can not speak for the other locations. The savory crepes are made with a unique (different but good) tasting flour, my favourites being tomato+manchego cheese+olive tapenade and the red pepper+ asparagus. And the list goes on! The sweet crepes are made with the traditional flour that we all know and love! Too many to choose from, the strawberry+chocolate+port is perfect for sharing! Really romantic at night and perfect for a post-Palau dinner. Lunch menus are great offering a scrumptious salad, a savory or sweet crepe of your choice, and a drink. for under 11euros. The staff are sweet and funny and the ambiance is chill and a nice escape from the bustle of the city center.",
