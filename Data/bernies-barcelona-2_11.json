    "Pretty solid diner when it comes to burgers, fries, and typical American fare. The inside is lined with Rt. 66 signs, James Dean photos, and Marilyn Monroe photos so you get the picture. My girlfriend and I came here after a week into our two month backpacking excursion (Barcelona was our third stop on our itinerary right around Thanksgiving). At this point we were both feeling a bit homesick due to the holiday and since we come from a place where there are more diners than there are U.S. states, we felt right at home at Bernie's. Service was good and the food hit the spot. Thanks Bernie!",
