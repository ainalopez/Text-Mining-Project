    "NEVER AGAIN! \u00a0Was definitely not as reviewed by other Yelpers. \u00a0 After 3 days of trying to sit at the bar, we finally accepted a side table. \u00a0No seat available. \u00a0The waiter provided me with a seat from a departing guest. \u00a0He suggested 3 different dishes and we accepted. \u00a0While waiting for our tapas, the owner stepped out of the bar and demanded I return his chair for a guest waiting at the bar. \u00a0What a big TURN OFF! \u00a0 Immediately our waiter was cordial enough to provide another seat. \u00a0 I thought the food at it's best was mediocre and cold. \u00a0Even though the Mercado is an excellent focal point, in comparison to Quimet Quimet the atmosphere and hospitality was lackluster. \u00a0Price wise by far the most expensive of all the tapas we had during our visit to Barcelona. \u00a0Bring cash. \u00a0No credit cards accepted. \u00a0Disappointed.",
