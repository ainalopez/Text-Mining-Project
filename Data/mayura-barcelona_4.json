    "It was disappointing. Ambience and interior is very nice, not the food. \u00a0We have ordered few dishes and starter. Except paneer Tikka, \u00a0everything thing was below average. \u00a0Even a simple daal was tasteless and sweet somehow. We specifically asked for hot and spicy food but didn't get it.",
