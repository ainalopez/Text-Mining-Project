    "Went in today for dinner. Ordered tapas sea urchin and sea food paiella . Ordered a desert with pistachio and black currant cream, which had pieces of plastic in it. I got 2 pieces of plastic on chewing, so called the waitress who immediately took it away and did not charge me for it. But rest all was ok. Food is not the best in Spain, worth 2 stars ( ofcourse after plastic incident) 1 star for customer service",
