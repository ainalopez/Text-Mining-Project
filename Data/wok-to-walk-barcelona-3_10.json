    "Who the heck goes to Spain to eat Asian food? Apparently I do (and not by choice, I swear!). =PMy friend was seriously craving noodles and I was too pooped from walking around the whole night to object. Walked by and saw a man through the window stir frying some fresh noodles. Ok the food looks appetizing, I'm game! Located in the barri gotic quarter, this place is pretty tiny and there is limited seating. Not great for big groups, but good enough for those who want to eat and go. Basically you order your noodle type, add-ons (meats and veggies), then your sauce. Simple but also with a lot of variety. The ingredients looked really fresh too. The noodles are cooked really fast too. 5 min or so and ta da! My bf and I shared one order. We got the whole wheat noodles, with chicken, tofu and cashews with the Bali peanut sauce. It was really good! The sauce wasn't too salty and had a nice kick to it. The meat and veggies were ample. The noodles tasted fresh. It was a good amount of food, and I think we maybe paid about 7 or 8 euros. The takeaway containers were cute too. Drinks are extra. They don't serve free tap water in Spain. Wok to Walk is budget friendly Asian food in Spain!",
