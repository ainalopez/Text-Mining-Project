    "Beer is cheaper than water in Spain. This fact makes me ridiculously happy, and I don't even really like beer! I was brought here one night on a food tour and really enjoyed snooping around downstairs in what once upon a time were brewing areas and now provide event spaces with cool lighting and mirror installations. We tried glasses of Moritz brewed in house and apparently very different to what you buy in bottles/cans elsewhere as it isn't pasteurised. Strangely, I enjoyed it and visited again a few nights afterwards for a relaxed dinner and a couple more beers!The bombe is the bomb. I don't care that that thing could give me a heart attack, I really just want to eat one every day for the rest of my days. The sandwiches are on excellent bread (made in the bakery next door!) and have delicious fillings. I had one laden with vegetables and pesto and felt rather virtuous.Come in the late afternoon or early evening and this is a great place to sit and read/write. There's decent music, efficient service and of course an endless supply of beer and snacks!",
