    "I wanted to try Gresca because it was mentioned in the places to try by Anthony Bourdain on the Travel Channel website.The first day we tried eating here, the restaurant was already booked... They told us to make a reservation for the next day so we did just that and I am glad we came back!Service was great~ \u00a0we had 2 waitresses that took care of us that were both very attentive and they both spoke English~We started off with a bottle of red wine. \u00a0It was one of the pricey cab that was on the menu 28euros but it was definitely worth it. \u00a0I ordered anchovies for my appetizer and Sweet bread for my main. \u00a0The anchovies were raw but seasoned perfectly and the citrus flavor masked the raw smell/flavor very well. \u00a0Sweet bread is actually one of my favorite dishes, and I must say this was one of the best I've had.Overall experience: 5 stars!",
