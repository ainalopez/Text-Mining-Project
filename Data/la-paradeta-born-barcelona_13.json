    "Incredibly fresh seafood in a laid back environment. They let you pick the seafood on ice right when you walk in the door. The lines are crazy long so be prepared to wait but it is well worth it. Lobsters, calamari, razor clams and shrimp were among our choices. They only prepare the seafood three ways - scampi with lots of garlic, marinara and lightly battered and fried. They have mastered the art of cooking super fresh seafood perfectly. Everything was outstanding. We came back another night before flying out and happily waited over an hour before eating. We will always be back when we visit this wonderful city!!",
