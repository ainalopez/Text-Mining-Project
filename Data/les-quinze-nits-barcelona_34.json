    "This restaurant is located in a nice plaza right off Las Ramblas. Easy and convenient location. We read previous trip advisor reviews about long queues so we decided to arrive early around 7pm. We still had a 10-15 minute wait. We landed a table right in the front, perfecto for people watching.We previously read that the service was pretty lousy, therefore we had very low expectations. This enabled us to have more patience, especially when our drinks did not arrive until 40 minutes after we sat down. I was observing the servers closely and noticed that there were only a handful of servers for the whole restaurant. This is a huge restaurant with a large outdoor and indoor area. These servers were working very hard, the restaurant just appeared understaffed. I would not say it is \"bad service.\"We started off with gazpacho soup and a salad with arugula, walnuts and parma cheese. Both of which were light and tasty. The soup was my favorite part of the meal. I would recommend trying it. We also ordered some chips and guacamole, which was a bit too salty. For dinner we tried the salmon with mixed vegetables in coconut cream. This dish was not what I expected. I thought it would come with coconut cream gravy, however there were only a few drops of cream on the plate for garnish. The fish was still fresh, but a bit dry and overcooked. I also tried codfish with garlic tempura in a garlic sauce. This was tastier than the salmon but still overcooked and chewy.Overall, this is a nice, but mediocre restaurant. The service is subpar and food is fresh, but not the best. However the prices are reasonable and the ambiance is wonderful. I probably would not wait more than 20 minutes. If there's no wait, it's worth a shot.",
