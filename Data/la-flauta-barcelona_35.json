    "Pretty good, but our waiter was kinda off-putting, like it didn't seem as if he enjoyed his job. Didn't crack one smile and had minimal eye contact.The food was a solid 4, better than Taller De Tapas. We had the avocado salad (\u20ac6.85), shrimp & calamari brochette (\u20ac3.65), full size of the anchovies + tuna mini baguette (\u20ac3.90 for half, \u20ac4.90 for full), half size of the beef filet (\u20ac7.80 for half, \u20ac9.50 for full). Not much difference between the half and full size.",
