    "Food 5 stars. Service 3 stars. The place was packed when we hit there around 10pm. It took 1/2 hours to get a table for 2. However, their tapas were what I expected from the reviews and great. Every dishes were great but my favorite was their fried small fishes. Their paella was awesome. But their waiting staff was slow and non-existent. Their daily specials were in Spanish. So they asked us to go to the bar and pick out the dishes we wanted. And they got our dishes mixed up. I don't mind pouring my own wine but not once they asked for anything and something. We will recommend this place based on food. Maybe the service will be better during American dinner time.",
