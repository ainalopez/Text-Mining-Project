    "Fun, self-serve pintxos spot near the Picasso Museum! Like most of the restaurants on the street, Euskal Etxea Taberna was packed when we got here, but my family was luckily able to snag some seating. The staff was friendly and the food options were aplenty. Grab a plate and fill it up with pintxos! Take bites of other people's and make your way up for round two. Don't forget to save the toothpicks! Although the food wasn't mind-blowing, we had a good time and were ready for our adventures around the Picasso Museum.Pro tip: The servers also bring around hot, fresh (and arguably yummier) pintxos that you can snag so don't get too full off of the ones on the counter!",
