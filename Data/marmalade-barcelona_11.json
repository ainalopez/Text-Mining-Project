    "What is Marmalade? \u00a0A very stylishly decorated lounge/bar in the up and coming quarter of El Raval. \u00a0we were there early on a saturday night, so it wasn't too crowded... that didn't make the service any faster, but - hey, this is Spain. \u00a0Sitting at the bar, I noshed on the Cajun fries which were basically fries with a dipping sauce that tasted like ketchup mixed with a couple of spices... not quite what I envisioned when I ordered the fries, but, well, whatever. \u00a0They do have a full bar, and rumor has it, they make a good bloody mary. \u00a0My friend who's been here before swears by their brunch - so I'll have come back for a meal one of these days. \u00a0I loved the juxtaposition of the old original floor tiles with the ultra modern decor - celebrating the old while making it updated and fresh and new. \u00a0there's a pool table, and a variety of seating areas... You can get free wifi, and the drink prices were reasonable.",
