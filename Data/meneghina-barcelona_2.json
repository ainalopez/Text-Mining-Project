    "3.5 stars. This place is pretty good. \u00a0I have had much better Italian food in the states. We had the burrata which was standard (but overpriced) and for the main dishes we had a the spaghetti and rice dish with squid. The squid dish was definitely the best one we tried. Overall, the place is overpriced for what it is. The wine I was too warm. The service was good. If you we in Barcelona on vacation, pass on this place and go to the gazillion excellent restaurants in this awesome hood. \u00a0If you are sick of tapas, go to red ant noodle house across the street or mosquito. Other good places in the hood include Elsa y Fred or picnic for brunch.",
