    "I love to chill here mostly in the afternoon when sun is not very direct. \u00a0There is always something going on, skaters, bikers, runners on the upper deck and surfers and beach volleyball players on the beach. \u00a0There are a few nice clubs- Opium, Carpe Diem and Ice Barceloneta are towards the end of the strip. \u00a0I also love to watch Frank Gehry Fish changing colors to the sunset.",
