    "Honestly the best meal I had while in Barcelona. I can definitely see why the reviews for this place are so good.In my opinion, the tapas are here are some of the best in Spain. My personal recommendation is to get the croquetas for the table. If I recall correctly, they do seem a bit pricey at first glance, but the plate we got was covered and layered with Iberian ham, which more than made up for the price. The pan con tomate they serve is also the best I've ever had.For those of you who don't know (we sure didn't), a pepita (the restaurant's namesake) is very similar to a sandwich. It generally consists of a long, thin strip of meat or vegetables placed between two equally long, thin strips of bread. Personally, I didn't think there was anything too special about the pepitas themselves. The pepita dishes, however, complete with the side items and the presentation, were very visually impressive. The foie gras they serve here is cooked extraordinarily well, and if you're into very fatty and succulent foods, you should definitely order it as a side to your pepita.I would definitely have to agree with a lot of the other reviews on Yelp. If you're in Barcelona for a few days, save this place for last. Otherwise, every place you try after this is just going to be disappointing.",
