    "LOVED this restaurant! The staff is SUPER friendly and great service. The owners/staff are from Napoli. \u00a0I had the spaghetti pomodoro and my husband had the tagliatelle dish. We each had a glass of wine and limoncello, after our meal. After paying the bill, our server brought us another round of limoncello on the house. By far the best service we got in Spain! Highly recommend this hidden gem.",
