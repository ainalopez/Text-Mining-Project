    "Our hotel staff recommended this place and made us a reservation. We walked in and were seated right away. Our server spoke english which was a plus!!! We had garlic prawns, bravas and coco bread. All three tasted great. The most amazing was my drink, mojito a la fresca. It was yummy and served in a mason jar. Overall great experience",
