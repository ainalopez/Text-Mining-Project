    "Food is wonderfully pleasant. Salsas are all exquisite and unique flare to each one and taste authentic. I had the chicken allegras and loved them. Really great taste and spice to them and paired well with the horchata that was refreshing.Ended with a corn cake and filled my stomach while leaving me with a thumbs up expirience",
