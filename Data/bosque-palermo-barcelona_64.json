    "This place is amazing, I almost don't want to write about it so no one finds out about it but then I remembered that I don't live in Barcelona so it's okay to share with my fellow yelpers/tourists!Great prices, large portions. The paella isn't the best thing I\"ve ever had but it's good enough. The service was great, the waitresses were friendly as with all people in Barcelona I feel like. The \"fish platter\" wasn't really a platter of fish but actually a platter of seafood!The house wine was only 3.75 EUR for the whole jug. Despite it being a little watery, it did its job. Maybe just get three jugs...Happy place, great good, what's stopping you from going?",
