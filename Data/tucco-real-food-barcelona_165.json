    "A MUST EAT!!! When I traveled Europe I wanted to try real Italian cuisine, something that had a taste straight from Italy. Tucco was everything I ever desired. Not only was it cheap, but the portions were very generous. With every meal they give you a free dessert. Everything was handmade and fresh and the taste backs up that statement. Plus the service was as good as the food. The owner, Juan Ignacio, treated us better than anyone I have met in Spain. Tucco has set the bar for Italian cuisine and its positioned on top!",
