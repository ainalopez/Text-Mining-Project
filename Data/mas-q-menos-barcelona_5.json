    "I ate at Mas Q Menos twice during my stay in Barcelona. This wine/tapas bar is fantastic for small, tasty meals. The staff was very friendly on both occasions and made fantastic recommendations for wine. The decor is sexy and modern and the food is great. I had the asparagus salad, the omelette tapa, and the serrano and cheese platter. All tasty. Prices are good.",
