    "Great tapas, excellent ambiance, and very friendly service. \u00a0We went to eat here twice during our visit. \u00a0The calamari with garbanzo bean pur\u00e9e was spectacular as well as the skirt steak with chimichurri sauce. \u00a0I really enjoyed the sangria and tomato grilled bread. \u00a0I hope to come back here again!",
