    "Went here on two occasions during our trip to BarcelonaWe had a look at the menu around lunch time and the big queue looked promising for reasonable prices.We went back for dinner and joined the line i was surprised how fast it went to be honest . We had a nice table with a view on the square.We ordered the gazpacho and carpaccio they were both really nice ! Then both had salmon as a main it was nice but a little under seasoned and overcooked for my taste . The price of the wine is defiantly a plus! Then a couple of nights after we went again Before we ordered i asked what wasn't on the menu (the last time we were there they didn't have any squid left ) and were told they had everything except the white fish, but when it came to ordering they didn't have the carpaccio or the penne pasta which was exactly what my friend wanted to order. After another look at the menu we decided on the mixed fried fish (really good!) the tagliatelle with cheese sauce and fresh tomato (again a little overcooked and not seasoned) and my main was cod with warm apple and black pudding. This was such a let down, i love black pudding so was very disappointed to find that there were only crumbles of it in my dish which made the sweetness of the apple completely take over the dish it was more like a fishy apple strudel and therefore i didn't finish it . The service was ok they are not that friendly but very efficient.",
