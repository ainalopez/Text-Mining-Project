    "Our first dish was aubergine chips with goat cheese, it was original and good. I never though about having chips of aubergine! On top they had my favourite cheese: goat's cheese and honey. Tasty and savoury chips.Second dish was dip fried calamari, I wasn't expected to have a full calamari. It was very nice, battered around was perfectly cooked and not soggy at all. My favourite one was the one made with ink. Of course to finish this wonderful weekend, I had my last croquettas, this one was different than all the one I had before. This time there was no cream taste, only meat. The meat was nice and warm, it had the same texture as rillette. \u00a0We had the massive plate of patatas bravas, eggs and Iberia \u00a0ham again, this restaurant had a wonderful twist to this classic dish: truffle sauce. No foie gras this time, but the truffle sauce made the difference. To end our last lunch, we had shrimps, there had been I think marinated before cooking, there were served with lemon and salt only. There were tasty, a little bit juicy too. La Xalada is one of those nice restaurants I will definitely come back with pleasure if I have the chance to go again soon in Barcelona. Service was good, waitresses paid attention to us and food was great. I just hope next time the weather will be as nice as the one we had.",
