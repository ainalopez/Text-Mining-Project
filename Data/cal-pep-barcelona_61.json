    "Great lunch time tapas butbe prepared to queue - 15 minutes. Tell them what you dont eat and let them suprise you. We had Coca bread brushed with tomato, garlic and olive oil, clams in a buttery herby sauce, crispy fried mini artichokes, a sumptious tortilla trampera, tuna tartare, monkfish with baked slice potatoes and tomato, and langustines, two beers and two fizzy water. 84 euros. But all very good and very friendly service. A fun time at the bar watching all the food being cooked.The restaurant area at the back had a very different atmosphere. More subdeued.",
