    "This place feels like the kind of joint you would find in a college town, providing a kind of knee-jerk multiculturalism without much sophistication. Yes, you can mix guacamole and Mediterranean bean dips in a single dish, but why would you, especially when serving them with toast? The ingredients don't complement each other at all. And yes, you can serve Thai curry dishes with Spanish tapas, but why? Though I am responsible for my own choices during my meal here, the answer was that the dishes combined poorly, making for a meal that was scattered and unfulfilling.",
