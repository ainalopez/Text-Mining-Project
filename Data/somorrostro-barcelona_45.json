    "We had a big group and finding a place that can accommodate is not always easy. \u00a0They were great to work with at Somorrostro. \u00a0Our waitress did everything possible to make our experience the best - she translated to English for those that needed it, made great suggestions, really took care of us. \u00a0The food was fantastic, the drinks moderately priced, the atmosphere fun. \u00a0It's a tiny place on a small little back street in Barceloneta that's packed with people of all types. \u00a0The only downside was the table next to us who wanted a more quiet, intimate place - which this place is not. \u00a0They complained about everything and actually asked us to laugh more quietly. \u00a0I'm pretty sure they won't be back again, but we will!",
