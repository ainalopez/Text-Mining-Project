    "As close to a 5-star I can give, but a solid 4. \u00a0I probably expected too much from the hype but for sure, this is a place to be seen, date-worthy and eye-candy all around, well at least tonite anyways.Popped in late around 11pm, and still humping busy; waited 5 min from the assuring eyes of the hostess, so took it after these glowing Yelp reviews. \u00a0Probably the decor got in the way of my judgement but still glad I partook in the following:bravascava sangriaand the clear-cut winner, Iberica pork ribs, the best honey-glazed & spices ever! \u00a0so tender along the edges, bursting with juices. \u00a0I wish I had ordered two but stay away from the octopus, way too moist (ironically) and the sauce just didn't do it.Pulpo: lamb skewers, good, tender, the green mint yogurt dip but nothing specialcatalana for dessert: tastes like creme brulee, super light as it's whipped cream so in that sense, it was easy to eat. \u00a0Probably wont need to order it again but if it's a spanish dessert, sure why not, I can't get this back home.And pretty tough to find in a way, as it's in a cool neighbourhood off the main track, in the alleys with close to tight buildings. \u00a0Kinda spooky at night coming off the cab at the main road walking in, as it's quiet and semi-dark, but after 20 feet, the bustlin' noise comes out like a night market ;)Only stammered in here by accident after an uneventful dessert at Bubo Bar.",
