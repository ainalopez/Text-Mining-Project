    "This place might not immediately grab your attention, but it's certainly worth a stop. The decor and atmosphere are charming and relaxing. Service was excellent.The food was not the most amazing you might find in Barcelona, but not at all disappointing. Despite somewhat high list prices, the portions are surprisingly large. We found that the five plates we ordered were a bit too much for two people.",
