    "Came here this afternoon upon exploring the beach scene. This place is awesome! Plenty of outside seating, friendly staff and delicious food. We had been traveling in Spain for days and were craving some salad and healthy bites after all the croquettes and fried food. My friend and I split the Caribbean salad and veggie burger and both were amazing. They also have a great drink menu. We tried the Flower Power and it was great! Definitely recommend.",
