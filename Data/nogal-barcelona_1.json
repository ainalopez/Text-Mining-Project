    "Amid many small \"shotgun style\" eateries populating Barcelona's streets, this corner restaurant offers charming indoor dining, a beautiful interior patio & cafe/street tables. \u00a0Terrific service by enthusiastic staff with excellent recommendations, the menu offers beautifully prepared and presented, flavorful Catalan style paella (with pasta) in addition to the more traditional version (over rice) with fresh & tender ingredients.I enjoyed the best caprese salad I've ever had (a feat having been in Italy for a week and having many!) and my friend's goat cheese salad was extraordinary (we were hard-pressed to decide which was better as both fell into \"the best ever\" category).The cannelloni was a bit bland (perfect for anti-spicy folk), and the home made caramel (bread) pudding was delightful. \u00a0Nogal was also open earlier than many of the area's restaurants & doesn't get busy until about 10:30 pm",
