    "My husband and I went to the market for lunch and the first place on my list was this place. Luckily we got there before the rush and were seated within 5 minutes. There's a sweet older man who works here and apparently knows all the other sweet older folks that shop the market. He asked us if we wanted fish/seafood or meats and proceeded to bring us our dishes. We got the seafood so he brought us grilled octopus- so tender and tastey and an egg/veggie/shrimp thing that was really flavorful too. There's no menu that I could see so he will make the decision for you! Prices are cheap and food was good. Lots of locals also dined here too. It's the place to go because by the time we were done eating, a huge line of people were waiting to eat!",
