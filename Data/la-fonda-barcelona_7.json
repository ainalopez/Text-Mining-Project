    "I went to this restaurant during my short trip to Barcelona for lunch with my family. It is definitely worth it for lunch. Sangria was pretty good and food overall was good. Desserts were too sweet though but gotta give credit for their creativity. I went here right when it opened but by the time I finished my three course meal, the restaurant was filled. So I would recommend going a little early before the lunch traffic comes in.",
