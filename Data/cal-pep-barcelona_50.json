    "Warning: Make sure you come here before they open at 7:30PM otherwise the wait will be long. We came here at 7:25PM and there were a bunch of people in front of us already. We had to wait till first round of people to finish up before we could sit down to eat. The energy is definitely there with chefs cooking up the dishes right in front of the bar stools and master chef Pep yelling and ordering. There is a dining room with tables in the back but is only reserved for groups and people who make reservations. Walk-ins only get bar stools but most people seem to be doing that anyway. We ordered 5 dishes of tapas to try and we enjoyed every single of them. 1. Fried Green Pepper: I mean it is fried so it has to be good; I think it is pretty hard to screw this one up. 2. Fried baby shrimp: Fresh shrimp with crispy edible shells. Yum. 3. Tuna Tartare: This is definitely a must. Fresh and tasty.4. Catalanian Bread: Baked baguette spread with tomato and olive oil. It is pretty damn good. 5. Fried artichoke: Pretty good but greasyWe also got a bottle of house white wine for only $9. That is a steal. We ended our dinner with two desserts: One is the Creme de Catalunya, which is basically creme Brulee and it is very good and two people can share. We were greedy so we got another burnt caramel top rum soaked cake (I don't know what it is called) but it is so damn good. \u00a0I would definitely come back next time. I saw a lot of people order the sauteed clams and fried triple fish and that looks like a winner.",
