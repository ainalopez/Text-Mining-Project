    "Gopal was part of my Quest for Cheap Sandwiches in Barcelona; the place was on my list of must-try food joints, mostly because I don't have a lot of good options for yummy veg places/food where I live, so it's always a delight to find good veg places outside the country.And you know what's also a delight? Finding out that the guy behind the counter is good-looking. I asked him which sandwich he'd recommend (their bestseller). He suggested 1. I ordered something else. He might've been a little annoyed with me. I would've been annoyed with me. This wasn't the first time I did this. I'm not sure why I bother asking.I was a little busy taking pictures & thinking \"I'm putting this on Yelp\" when I saw my \"para llevar\" (to go) order being waved around in the air, after about 5 minutes. I thought, \"oh\", grabbed it & walked out, slightly embarrassed.My plan was to eat about a third of that spicy chorizo sandwich (or burger) for dinner. I ended up eating most of it, because it was so yummy. It cost \u20ac4+.Gopal. Go there for yummy yet affordable veg food in Barcelona.",
