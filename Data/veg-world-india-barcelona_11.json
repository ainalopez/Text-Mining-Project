    "Wow. \u00a0This was a great little hole in the wall style restaurant. \u00a0The dishes we ordered were no cream, all veggies. \u00a0They are vegetarian but I think they do use cream and eggs at times in other dishes.A nice respite from the constant Jambon and Pan con Tomate regimen.We would go all the time if there was one near us in California.",
