    "Saw this little place on Yelp, and thought we'd give it a try, so glad we did great atmosphere, friendly staff (good English) and excellent food. We ordered three egg, ham and mushroom omelette (which came with roast breakfast potatoes) and French toast. Both tasted delicious and we're generous sizes. Add to that the couple of coffee's and teas we had and the bill came to around 22 euros. Will definitely be eating here again, probably tomorrow!",
