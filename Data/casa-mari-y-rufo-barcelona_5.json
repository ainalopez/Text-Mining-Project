    "Well, after a week in France I didn't figure on a small almost hole in the wall in BCN totally blowing all those great French meals away...but that's what happened. The front of the restaurant is the kitchen and prep area with a small bar. Dining room sits in the back with about 10 tables. Do not be fooled by the decor as it's nothing fancy at all- this place is about the fresh market ingredients and GREAT FOOD. \u00a0It's a family business; one brother spoke English with us and made some suggestions while his bro' cooked it up. Started with the most tender, fresh calamari I've ever had, followed by whole , succulent shrimp in garlic, olive oil, and salt...do not miss out on tasting the shrimp brains as they taste just like the ocean! Finished with the special of the day, get this...Fries topped with two sunny side up eggs, sauteed foie gras, truffles shaved tableside, and balsamic vinegar. \u00a0The chef came out to toss the plate and serve us, instructing to mop up all the delicious drippings with bread. It did not disappoint. Absolutely the highest quality ingredients and a fun, inviting atmosphere, no waiting on a Friday night at 10:00...and no other tourists. The chef topped it all off by theatrically preparing his special gin and tonic in front of a transfixed dining room. This is just a great experience that everyone should try if her in Barcelona. EUR 70 including a bottle of wine; not cheap but servings were huge and the two of us left stuffed.",
