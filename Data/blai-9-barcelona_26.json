    "Excellent and cheap tapas (they say they range from 1 - 1.5 euros each, but things on the wall suggested higher prices for other things - can't read Spanish so I didn't know what it was for). However I had about 8 dishes and a beer and the total was 14 euros. Service was good and quick. Will likely drop by again. One thing I really liked about this place is that they used pancakes as a base for tapas instead of bread. It was a nice twist on the typical dish.",
