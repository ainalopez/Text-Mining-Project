    "Having been recommended by a friend, I checked out the place with my parents while visiting Barcelona. The waitresses are extremely friendly and service minded. One of them gave us some great recommendations of drinks, appetizers and main course. We especially loved the famous blackberry mojito and lamb as main course. I look forward to going back there next time I visit.",
