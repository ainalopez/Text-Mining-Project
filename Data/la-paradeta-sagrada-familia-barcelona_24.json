    "Soooo good! Everything was very fresh and cooked to perfection! My favorite was the baby calamari which was deep fried and crispy! We also had mussels in marinara which was excellent and prawns which were nice with the garlic oil. Oysters also great! We got there about 10 min before they opened for lunch and it was great because only like 10 people in front of us already in line.",
