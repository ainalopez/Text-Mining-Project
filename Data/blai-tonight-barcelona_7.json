    "So good, so good, that I nearly do not want to write this review and keep that place in secret for myself and my friends.You need max 10 euro to be full and merry (that is all including drinks and food). Atmosphere is super friendly and guys at the bar give the recommendations to new tapas lovers not to make a mistake in the choice among all of these wonderful small foods.New tapas are coming literally every 10-15 minutes in the evening, so there is always something for everyone.The interior of the taverna is styled with the Papay sailorman theme - kind of funny : )Drop by when in Barcelona!",
