    "It was a nice surprise to find this cute and cozy restaurant in the middle of Gracia neighborhood. Recently renovated following a modern Nordic style. \u00a0Food was delicious and the chef propose a wide modern and elegant menu. I ask for the tataki and the chef cooked it for me with very little crust of tempura as I order. The wasabi foam was delicious, a bit hot and spicy, the perfect match for the tuna. \u00a0My two dinner companions were also happy with their main courses(cochinillo and cod). Our waiter was very attentive, but without disturbing our animated conversation. He suggested a wine that was moderate in price and easy to drink. In sum, we were delighted with our dinner and we enjoyed of the bohemian environment of the rest.",
