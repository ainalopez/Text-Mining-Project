    "You have to manage your expectation. This is Chinese/Japanese Buffet in Barcelona, not NYC or Toronto. It won't be gourmet but you can eat sufficient \"expensive\" item made it as a value meal, especially if you craved for Chinese food. I am planning to have ONE asian buffet meal in Barcelona and I really want to find the best in these OK buffet. I personally visited 3 buffet place in lunch time the day before in order to make a decision (i know i am crazy). The reason I picked this restaurant is the ingredient look fresher than other 2 places, although it's not as many as selection as Dao or Wok. Dao has more selection, but it doesn't look too attractive (raw and cooked), and the lady told me that the coke will be 3.6 Euro (i am very cautious about the drink price because i know you have to order drink in these buffet place). Wok also has more choice but the sushi didn't look as good as Yutaka. So finally the food time. The servers speaks good english to serve and they are quite attentive. Drink is quite reasonable. 2.1 Euro for beer and 1.95 for coke. Food is ok and I enjoy the marisco placha a lot. Not the best razor calm but acceptable. I ate lots of cherries.It's quite expensive in Barcelona. Our bill end up to be 26 euro for lunch for 2 people. Reasonable. For the best of the average buffet, i would still recommend this place.",
