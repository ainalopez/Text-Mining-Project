    "Excellent food and outstanding service this evening at L'Amfora, which was recommended by the concierge at our hotel. Easy distance from the subway. Endless patience from the warm waitstaff. Truly delicious food. We had lamb chops and tapas--gambas, charcuterie, asparagus, beans and baby squid--and a lovely cava. Topped off with a flan. Authentic food, served fresh and hot. Not cheap, but we felt like we were having a luxury experience--treated like most welcome guests--and at about 40E a head, not terribly expensive. Would certainly return.",
