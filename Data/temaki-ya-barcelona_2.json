    "We were craving for some japanese yesterday night and looking at yelp we decided to come here. Our first option, Simpu, is closed on Sundays. First, it is not a japanese per se, it is a fast food that serves a kind of big hand rolls. For around 6 euros you have a big (not huge) hand roll with crab, tuna, salmon or vegetables, and different combinations of sauces and greens. It is a quite small place, with tall tables and stools. They also have some rolls and some makis, salads and drinks. I think the food that you get for the price you are paying is not enough. We had to make some popcorn as soon as we got home, because we were still hungry. Don't get me wrong, quality is good, and it is tasty, but I will put my euros somewhere else next time.",
