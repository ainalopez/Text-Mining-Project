    "This was a perfect place for our evening in the city. It was quite busy bout very helpful staff politely asked to have a drink in a bar next door, and after only a few minutes, we could even take our bottle of sangria with us to La Pepita. Then we had three tapas to share, and we loved it so much we decided to get another round of three tapas with another sangria, and finished with cr\u00e8me Catalana. The bill of \u20ac78 was definitely adequate as we were so happy with the food and service as well as the location and cosines of the place.And try their foie grass with white chocolate. It's insanely great.",
