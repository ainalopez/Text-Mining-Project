    "My brother found this place in a guide book - it was delicious! \u00a0It was a little difficult for us to find because it is located in the fish market and there was some construction in the area. \u00a0The restaurant itself is casual with what reminded me of 80s decor. \u00a0It was also a little difficult to communicate with the waitress since she could not speak English and our Spanish is terrible. \u00a0However, we were able to get what we needed and she was very nice and accommodating.As for the food, this is what we ordered:1. \u00a0Zarzuela (seafood stew) - Yum! \u00a0One of the best dishes I tried in Spain. \u00a0It was a pretty good serving of a tomato-y sauce with different kinds of fish and other seafood. \u00a0Sooo good. \u00a0I used my bread to dip in the sauce. \u00a0My family asked for bowls because we thought it was like a soupy stew but the sauce is thicker than that. \u00a0You don't need a bowl. \u00a02. \u00a0Lamb chops - also really delicious! \u00a0Sprinkled with sea salt.3. \u00a0Some sort of mushroom vegetable dish - also good and flavorful.After we ate, we walked through the market and had some gelato for dessert. \u00a0I wanted to come back and eat here again but we ran out of time!",
