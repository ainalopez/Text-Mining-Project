    "I just returned to my flat after having dinner here tonight. Food was average. The menu didn't have the items pictured here except for the potatoes and they were more like cold, deep fat fried, potato peels. I had the fries, meat, wine and dessert which came to \u20ac30. Service was average for Barcelona. My meal ended with a rude/aggressive encounter with a man standing at the bar who was friends with the staff. (Although I don't believe the staff knew what happened.) Unpleasantness was due to me being American. (Which was particularly unsettling after the massacre in Paris this weekend.) Being a lone diner, I paid my bill and left. Won't be returning during the rest of my stay.",
