    "Ass-some! Good old traditional tapas bar. When going in, get ready for the battle! Elbow in to your slice of heaven spot by the bar and order the pitcher of sangria. Dont ask for prices, because it wont break ur bank. Pretend u r local, because that what the crowd will be around u. Mostly older Spanish ppl, mixed with groups of students that flock to this bar from a university near by. some of patrons look like hey were present during Ferdinand and inquisition! Cold tapas are assorted on plates in front of u on the bar, and u need to help yourself wile sipping n your Rioja or sangria. Than every few minutes or so waiter will pass by with a plate of hot tapas, and you are welcome to grab these from the plate. You must keep the toothpicks that comes on tapas, because that's how they ll know your tab. all tapas are the same price. My personal favorites are the morzilla and the various ages cheeses with sweet marmelad on top. I didn't come across one tapa that we didn't enjoy. Wanted o go there our sat day in Barcelona, but, unfortunately, they were closed on Sunday. this place is now my must-go for all future visits to Barcelona!",
