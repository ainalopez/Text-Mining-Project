    "If you are going to eat here, and you absolutely should, plan on getting there right at 7:30 when they open, or you will be waiting. The restaurant consists of a bar top with approximately 15-20 bar stools, which are the only seats for dining.My friend and I arrived at approximately 7:45 and waited about 40 minutes until we were seated. Our server asked if we had any allergies and if there was any sort of fish/food we did not like. With that, he served us about 6 or 7 plates. We ordered a bottle of wine and dessert. Our meal total was around 80 Euro I believe. This was by far the best dining experience we had in Barcelona. The atmosphere, service, and food were great!",
