    "Bar del Pla! Come on, guys!When in Barcelona, you'll find a million tapas bars, literally several every block. Does Bar del Pla stand out? Probably depends where you've been.To me, it was perfectly portioned tapas, to-die-for croquettes, amazing tartare, just delectable and at the right place, right near the Picasso museum.My recommendation, hit the Picasso, get worn out, and warm up with un crianza and tapas at Bar del Pla! You won't be sorry!Thanks for listening!",
