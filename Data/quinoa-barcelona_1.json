    "Perfect for vegetarians and vegans! I actually ended up going twice because it was close to the apartment I was renting. I had a miso and beet root veggie burger with a pineapple mint apple juice for lunch, and it was excellent!For dinner I had a quinoa salad that had many veggies and avocado, and my sister got a fresco sandwich with pesto, zucchini, tomato, nuts, and mozzarella that she also enjoyed with strawberry mango apple juice. I would recommend eating food to go, or going with two or less people because it has very few tables and space.Delicious food though, would recommend to anyone looking for quick, healthy, delicious food!",
