    "Stopped for a quick noshing. Ordered a grilled provolone with Iberian ham assuming it was a sandwich, but it was simply cheese melted in a dish and topped with the ham. Not that it was bad, but it was not exactly a meal and it was very one-note (salty). The date ordered an empanada (with caramelized onions, goat cheese, and nuts) and grilled vegetables with romesco (asparagus, mushrooms, pearl onions, red pepper, tomato, zucchini, eggplant). All of it was plain but sound and good. We washed it down with more sangria.",
