    "Right near the center city, this restaurant provides a welcome break from the busy streets. The steaks are great, perfectly cooked and quality. The ambiance is upscale and welcoming at the same time. While I don't get to Barcelona as often as I would like, when I find myself in the area am sure to stop in.",
