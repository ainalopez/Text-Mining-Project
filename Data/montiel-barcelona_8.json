    "I found Montiel on Yelp, and hadn't planned to go until I walked past it, and saw the people inside making \"omg I love this food\" faces.Prepare to spend 3-4 hours enjoying your meal, but let me say it was completely worth it. \u00a0The gastronomic tasting menu introduced me to flavors and textures I've never experienced with food.Highly recommend going with the wine pairing. \u00a0Gabbi, the Sommelier, introduced each bottle with a passionate story and love for the process and flavor in each wine. \u00a0Each wine was a perfect compliment to the course.Highlights:-Prawn Tar Tar wrapped in Avocado-Quail Salad accompanied by Olive Oil Sorbet, Oranges, and Mushrooms. \u00a0Incredible pairing.- Seared Red Tuna with Iceberg Luttuce Sorbet. \u00a0Such and interesting pair, and the tuna was perfect and fresh.-White fish with mint and lime sorbet.-Duck and Pear Ravioli in a Foie sauce. \u00a0One of THE dishes of my life. \u00a0I could have ordered 20 of these. \u00a0Or made a trip from out of town just to have this again-The only disappointing part was the wagyu beef. \u00a0It had an amazing flavor, but the cut of meat had a lot of chewy parts that I couldn't eat. \u00a0The accompanying potato and veal mix was incredible though. \u00a0I would go with the suckling pig option if you go. \u00a0Everyone was raving about it.-I honestly can't tell you what I ate for dessert, but it was a symphony of flavors!",
