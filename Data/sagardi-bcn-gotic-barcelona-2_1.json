    "We came here on the recommendation of our Rick Steves' guidebook and had a lovely late-afternoon bite.The set up was new to us - you are given a plate, and are free to pick out whatever items (all bite sized hors d'oeuvres called pintxos) you want. \u00a0You are charged for the number of toothpicks you have used at the end of your visit. \u00a0The snacks are all a mix of meats or cheeses served on bread and tasty. \u00a0The downside is that nothing is labeled, and even if you ask the staff, you may not get a helpful answer (if you are English speaking tourists like us) - so, expect to be surprised! \u00a0The wines by the glass are tasty and inexpensive.Apparently, this style of cuisine is prevalent in the Basque region of Spain, and it's worth experiencing here if you're not making the trek there anytime soon.Overall, this place was a casual, cool place to grab a bite and a drink!",
