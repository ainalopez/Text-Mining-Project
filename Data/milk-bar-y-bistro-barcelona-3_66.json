    "Great spot for brunch but beware - service can be slow when the place is packed (which is typical). Trust me: it's worth it.The coffee is strong and smooth and the french toast is ace. Word on the street is the salmon eggs benedict is the best in Barcelona, so you should probably go there and check it out.FREE WIFI!",
