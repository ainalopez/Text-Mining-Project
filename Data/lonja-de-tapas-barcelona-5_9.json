    "Stumbled upon this place when me and my friend wanted to go to Tapeo anem de tapes next door, which is closed on Mondays. This was our first tapas experience, and we were pleasantly surprised by their tasting menu and their level of service.For 18 euros a person, you can get the tasting menu which comes with at least 8 different plates. I say at least because we got 3 extra plates for free, which was great but completely unnecessary because we were beyond stuffed by the time we had tasted all the plates in our menu. My absolutely favorite tapas that I still dream about:-Catalan beans. Never thought I could like beans so much. -Patatas bravas. We had this dish at 2 other tapas places in Barcelona and I've got to say that Lonja de Tapas does it best. The sauces were phenomenal!Also loved the staff. Being amateurs, we didn't think the tasting menu would fill us up, so we tried to order a paella to go along with it. The waiter chuckled and told us that it's a loooot of food and that we wouldn't need the extra dish, and I'm so glad he did because he was so right!Next time, I'd order the tapas individually instead of the tasting menu, because to be honest a couple of items on that menu were good but not that great. I'm glad I tried it though because I would never have tasted the perfection that is catalan beans otherwise.",
