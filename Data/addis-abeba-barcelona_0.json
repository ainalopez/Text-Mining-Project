    "Fantastic Ethiopian restaurant!!! I really love this place! First reason is because the service was really good. Second of all, the food was super tasty. The ingredients were really fresh and healthy. I like how they serve the food that everything was put together in an Ethiopian traditional big plate for everyone to share. There are many vegetarian choices as well. The meat choices are also very good. The atmosphere was really nice and calm. The tables are kind of lower than usual western type of table. It's just something different and interesting to try. This place is packed really quickly, so it's better to make a reservation before going. I highly recommend this place if you happen to be in Barcelona Sants. It's just about 5 minutes from the station by walk.",
