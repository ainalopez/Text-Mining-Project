    "Best Catalan meal I've had in Barcelona, and astoundingly inexpensive -- my entree was a huge pork sausage that came dangling from a spit above a plate of potatoes and peppers. \u00a06.25\u20ac.Their signature snails are an obligatory appetizer, as well as the cal\u00e7ots, which you can watch them grill over an open flame -- my fingers were covered in charcoal afterwards, but it's part of the ride. \u00a0The servers were fast and good-humored, eager to explain anything on the menu and give recommendations (assuming you can speak a little espa\u00f1ol, or Catalan ideally). \u00a0Can't say you could really go wrong with anything on the menu.My favorite part, though, was that despite the cool jazz and white tablecloths, they had a plasma screen mounted on the wall so you could keep an eye on the Bar\u00e7a game. \u00a0Brilliant.",
