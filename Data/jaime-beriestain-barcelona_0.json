    "Ended up here because it looked nice from the outside and wasn't far from the hotel: important criteria when it suddenly starts raining! It turned out to have been an excellent choice. The atmosphere was relaxed, modern and elegant. The chairs were exceptionally comfortable and the waiters made us very welcome. Try the complimentary olive oil, it's really that good. Prices are rather high (but in keeping for Barca and fair when compared with the quality on offer and the portion sizes). Had the ribs, which fell off the bone and came with a delicious BBQ sauce and apples (\u20ac19). The Cava was also first rate (\u20ac29 - Recaredo Brut Nature). Only criticism would be that they forgot the drinks ordered for dessert. Would definitely recommend it and will be back.",
