    "One cannot live on tapas alone, so when my wife wanted to try something simple for lunch, we stumbled upon this pizza place, purportedly owned by a world champion of pizza. \u00a0While perhaps not the greatest pizza in the world, it wasn't far from it--the four cheese blend in particular was outstanding and memorable. \u00a0Decent wine was available, and prices were extremely reasonable. \u00a0Definitely worth a visit.",
