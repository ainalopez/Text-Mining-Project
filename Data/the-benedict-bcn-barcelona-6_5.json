    "Although the huge lines outside for weekend brunch would suggest otherwise, I actually prefer The Benedict over the tiny-and-crowded Milk across the alley.For starters, they have good bacon. REALLY GOOD. Also, unlike Milk, you can almost always find a seat for breakfast without a wait. The staff are super friendly, and it's got a playful ambiance that makes a meal here really enjoyable.One negative? The scrambled eggs. Their fried eggs are by far the best choice.",
