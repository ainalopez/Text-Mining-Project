    "We went to this restaurant because my friend is vegetarian and we thought it sounded interesting. I am not vegetarian, but I am rethinking my life choices because this place was so amazing. We ordered juice, which was delicious. I've never had juice so good in my life. Our meal was amazing as well as our appetizer, we got the nachos, and the dessert, chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream; that vanilla ice cream was the best I've ever eaten. I regret not finding this place on the first night we were there because we probably would have gone there for dinner every night afterwards! The staff was super friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was very relaxing. All in all I would definitely recommend. Even if you're a meat eater, don't pass this place up! It's amazing!",
