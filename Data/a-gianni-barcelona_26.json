    "I am so happy I found A Gianni -- a family-run restaurant! I arrived a little before they open for dinner at 8:00 and asked if I could wait on the couch in their front area but the hostess told me she'd be happy to seat me. I was dining by myself and asked if, by chance, they had wifi... the hostess was so kind and offered me the password. I ordered a margarita pizza and it was oh-so-delicious (this is coming from a New Yorker and total pizza snob). All the ingredients were fresh and the pizza was cooked to perfection. The atmosphere is cozy and romantic. I highly, highly, highly recommend A Gianni!",
