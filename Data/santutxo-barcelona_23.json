    "Had a late dinner here of tapas beers and wine. The tapas are all homemade from scratch and everything was delicious! The best dish was a homemade cornbread empanada stuffed with goat cheese and topped with a tomato marmalade....super memorable! What really makes this place stand out though is its owner/waiter/bartender who is a singular personality and has a level of positive energy and excitement about food that is rare to find. Highly reccomend!!!",
