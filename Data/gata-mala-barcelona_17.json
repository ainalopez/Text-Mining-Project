    "We had some refreshing tinto de verano s here in around 7 pm on a Tuesday night and it was packed with locals. The bartender didn't speak English but was super nice to us. The owner was originally from Pakistan and was a cool guy to chat with. Lovely bar and highly recommended for a more low key, authentic barca experience.",
