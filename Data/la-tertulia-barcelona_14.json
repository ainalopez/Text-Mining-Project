    "After spending a week staying down at La Ramblas, I was convinced there was no edible food in Barcelona. \u00a0Thankfully, we had to switch hotels and ended up away from the touristy part of town. \u00a0Thanks to Yelp, we found La Tertulia and it was phenomenal!Mostly locals (and for some reason, policemen) were frequenting this place. \u00a0We know nothing about tapas, so we asked our waiter (who spoke a tiny bit of English) for an assortment. \u00a0Everything was delicious, including the sangria. \u00a0Highly recommend La Tertulia if you're looking for good tapas, and yes, it's well worth the trip outside La Ramblas.",
