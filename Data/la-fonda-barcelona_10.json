    "We went here for early dinner by Barcelona standards. Great restaurant, friendly staff, and good food. They are open from 1pm to 11pm daily!They have a special menu (prix fixe) for 17 euros which includes a starter, a main course, a dessert, 1/4L of wine, and bread. Great deal overall with huge portions for one person. The black noodles with squid was too salty. The stewed veal was delicious. The ice cream was just just out of the package on a stick. Also had the goat cheese salad which is delicious. Overall great experience, would definitely recommend a visit.",
