    "Exquisite. The food was wonderful, the service was great and the music and ambience was fun. We had the chef's choice menu which ended up being a ton of different tapas. Personal favorites include the salmon, sea bass, calamari and eggplant. Would highly recommend for everyone and we're hoping to go again.",
