    "I didn't think this place needs another review. But what da heck. Yelp isn't all that popular in Barcelona so having this much reviews should tell u something. We came in didn't expect to get seated and the place was packed (fri night). We were waiting around the bar area and lucky enough we got seats. Don't plan on what u want to eat. Just sit down and point to whatever your heart tells you. This place is legit. Love it.",
