    "5 star food 5 star service across the board! Cute little spot that is definitely a hidden gem. First time in Barcelona and I looked up top rated restaurants and I can see why this one made it to the top of the list. We started with some tapas: must try the flank steak tapas with spinach and mushroom sooooo good!! I also really liked their patatas bravas and their teriyaki pork shoulder tapa was a great choice as well! Ended the night with their paella and it was delicious! Not the biggest portion but after eating all those tapas it was enough. The sangria was also so delicious! The service was great and I'll tell you why. My 4 year old goddaughter was whining bc she wanted ice cream. That wasn't an option on the dessert menu but our waiter purposely went out of his way to a little bodega to buy her one. Such a nice gesture. I will absolutely return when I visit Barcelona again!!!",
