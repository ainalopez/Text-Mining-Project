    "This place is awesome. It's quick and delicious! So basically you pick your noodles or rice, protein, sauce, and toppings. I picked the egg noodles with chicken, spinach, fried onions, and Bali sauce. Best combo I've tried so far! This particular location has some seating options but they are limited and a bit crowded. Good luck finding a spot if you wish to stay.",
