    "Totally random find for late lunch. Off the tourist path, quiet and cozy. We stumbled upon this little gem. Situated right next to a beautiful flower shop, this little place has an open terrace area that looks over the street, the flowers, and is smoking friendly. Service was quick, local, warm and friendly. We were first to arrive, and by the time we left, the entire restaurant was packed, clearly a local favorite.We had eggplant, pepper and anchovies salad, assorted catalonia sausage, and oh the best ever - snail! It was so unexpected, but well, the restaurant has a snail as its logo, so I guess it should be expected! The snails were large, tasty, with a lot of garlic in its sauce, and salted so well that you could just suck and lick the snail shells.",
