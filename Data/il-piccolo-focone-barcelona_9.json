    "Gluten free heaven.This is hands down the best gluten free pizza I have ever tasted. It would make anybody with coeliac disease want to visit Barcelona. The pizza just melts in your mouth. The owner is a really nice Italian guy, and apparently his kids are gluten free, so he serves all dishes with or without gluten. They also have great Sangria and gluten free pasta. I hope this turns into a big franchise one day, it would do so well. It might seem like an odd location if you're a tourist in Barcelona, but the famous Sagrada Familia is just a few blocks away, so you could combine the two in a day.",
