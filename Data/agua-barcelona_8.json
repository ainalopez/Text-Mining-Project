    "This was by far my favorite restaurant in a week of eating at nice restaurants in Barcelona. The food was amazing, service was outstanding, decor is cool, and it's right on the beach. I had the hake with patties and tomato. They cook it in a cast iron skillet and put crushed tomato, Spanish olive oil, garlic and it makes this amazing light tomato sauce. And then thin sliced potato and a nice chunk of super fresh white flaky fish. Amazing. Definitely Mediterranean at its best. And the wine is spectacular. Fairly cheap and really good Spanish red wine. And for desert I had the almond/apricot tart with vanilla cream. This is definitely going to the first restaurant I eat at next time I am in Barcelona.",
