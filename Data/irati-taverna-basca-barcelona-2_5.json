    "The first place I ate at while in Barcelona. \u00a0Wandered upon this place after checking into the hotel and taking a stroll down the Ramblas. \u00a0A few wrong twist and turns, and low and behold there was Irati Taverna Basca. \u00a0Just busy enough to be inviting but not too busy (at the time) for us to pass on it. \u00a0The pinto tapas placed on the counter were beckoning us to try. \u00a0All the diners there were happily munching on the pintxos. The pintxos were all amazing. \u00a0The most memorable on was the pintxo that was both sweet, creamy, and savory. \u00a0Reasonably priced, when you're done just let staff count up the tooth picks to tabulate your bill.",
