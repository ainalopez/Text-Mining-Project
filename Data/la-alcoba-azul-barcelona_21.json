    "I just came back from Barcelona, and too bad I didn't discover this place until my last day there. \u00a0The restaurant looks to be pretty small inside, but we sat outside in the square like most other patrons. \u00a0Our server was so nice and friendly. \u00a0They have a spanish menu outside the door but he handed us an English menu as he saw us staring blankly at their outside menu (yea, I took french in school not spanish, looking back not a great choice). \u00a0We had a great appetizer, the pate, which was very rich and smooth. \u00a0Their menu had \"toasts\" which were large in size and had toppings, kind of like a pizza but imaging toppings on a piece of toasted bread. \u00a0The spinach and goat cheese toast was great. \u00a0Our server said these were all his grandmother's recipes, how endearing, I like small homey restaurants so much!I really think I should've taken the advice of going into the smaller squares and side roads in Barcelona (especially in Barrio Gothic and other touristy areas) because my two favorite restaurants were discovered this way (and confirmed by yelp beforehand of course).",
