    "By now, you know you're pretty much REQUIRED to get carrot cake if you come to Spice, right? ;)We found Spice toward the end of our trip, and it felt like we were home at some of our favorite coffee shops. Top 3 reasons to visit?1. Like literally every review has raved about, the carrot cake is absolutely wonderful. Seriously. Our drinks were good too; instead of chai, our server recommended another tea (something with Yoga in the name?) that was AWESOME. 2. Service here is tops -- they're great, friendly people who would love to have a conversation with you, but are also happy to leave you alone if you're there to study/get things done on their speedy wifi.3. A/C. Glorious, glorious A/C. Limited hours here on weekdays. Make sure you schedule a trip to Spice when you're here!",
