    "MUST MUST MUST! If there's a line wait all day if you have to!!!! Best food ever. It's a whole in the wall. If you can't speak Spanish, just order one of everything. Words really can't express the food, the freshness, the authentic Spanish vibes, and the magic. This is a place for locals. Omggg why am I not in Barcelona right now.",
