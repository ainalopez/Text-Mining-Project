    "Our family stopped by this place after a recommendation from a friend. We didn't have a reservation but were seated without a wait around 7:30. Our family of 4 ordered a salad, the mussels and clams sauteed in garlic, the seafood and fish paella, the black rice with cuttlefish, and 2 desserts- the hazelnut ice cream and Catalan custard. I've come to realize that salads in Europe are not the best thing to order at restaurants. Everything else, however, was wonderful! I would definitely recommend the black rice with cuttlefish and the seafood paella. The desserts were good, but not amazing. And for those that don't know, Catalan custard is a sort of creme brulee/flan mix. The restaurant got very crowded soon after we got there, so if you plan on eating past 8, I would definitely recommend a reservation. They have menus in several different languages and the service was great. A good place to stop if you want to enjoy a nice meal near the beaches of Barcelona!",
