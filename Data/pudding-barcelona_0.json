    "You don't have to take hallucinogens to feel like you are Alice in Wonderland. This whimsical coffee shop was a really great rest spot while in Barcelona - to get some coffee/sweets, charge our phones, and well...feel like we were in a storybook!First the magical creations:Cheesecake with a strawberry jam on top. Very generous sized slice. It was delicious.Affogato was on point! For those that have never had it, affogato is espresso poured over ice cream. I know right? I just discovered this fairly recently and I'm kicking myself for not having it in my life sooner! This was one of the best I've had!Great service! The gentleman that took care of us was super nice, quick and checked in on us from time to time. Cashing out was super easy and fast.Now, to what this places looks like. It obviously looks like Alice in Wonderland came to life with giant mushrooms, unique art on the wall and mismatching plates. The roof is covered with red and white drapes, that sag down. At first look you might think it's like a circus tent, but nope - it's actually positioned to make you feel like you are inside a mushroom! There's a downstairs area, and there are two massive (two story) mushrooms located there - you can see their caps from the second (main) floor. The art on the wall includes portraits of dogs dressed as commanders (haha) and the plates as I mentioned are all mismatching. Such a cool vibe and feel here - you really think you are meeting up the Maddhatter.",
