    "Not really hungry and Yelp bookmarks. That's is how we can summarize how we ended in Bouzu. And of course, we didn't want to cook that night. We can define the restaurant as an Izakaya (Japanese tavern). It is a small place divided in two areas and a terrace. The lobby that has bars on the sides where you can sit and have your meal, and a dining room at the end of a corridor hosting 20-25 sits divided in 8-10 tables. We got in yesterday and we decided to wait for a table inside. They offered us the bar, but we wanted to get properly sit, so we wait around 20-30 min to get a table while sipping a Japanese beer.As we had the menus from before, we had already filled the checklist they have in order for you to order. We were not really hungry so we decided to get raw fish instead of the fried stuff that you can get in a Izakaya. We ate jellyfish and seaweed salad as starter (delicious, it was our first time tasting jellyfish) followed by some sashimi, that literally melted in our mouths and a bowl of raw tuna and salmon with rice. The fish again was delicious as so was the rice. A good discovery thanks to the yelp bookmarks, always useful when you don't really know what to get \u00a0and have the will to discover something new.",
