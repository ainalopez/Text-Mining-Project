    "Date night with the hubby... Had amazing mouth-watering sirloin steaks grilled to perfection, shared fries and baked potato, both were delicious and seasoned very well. Price was also exceptional! Oh and to finish off the meal right, they gave us two shot glasses of sorbet with a touch of alcohol on the house. Delicious and light. Service was great, from the moment we walked in until the moment we left, very polite and patient, especially when your indecisive... A bit like myself :)! Definitely going back there every date night!!!",
