    "Semi casual atmosphere amazing customer service. Clean overall including the restrooms. Great quality food. Being away from my town was the closest I came to Armenian style BBQ. If im ever back to Barselona will definitely revisit this restaurant. I recommend everyone to try this place. Five star overall review from my experience.",
