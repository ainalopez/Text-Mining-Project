    "Most interesting meal we've had in Barcelona.The chef sure knows how to be creative and amazing!Stuffed squid, squid ink pasta, foie gras with truffled poached eggs, marinated beef cheek, cava sangria and a few more (which i forgot the name). The place was not really easy to find. It was in a tiny little alley apparently pretty close to Picasso's museum. When we turned to the alley, there was a huge line of people waiting for something (we got really scared that it might be the line for the restaurant since we have heard so many good things about the place) but as we walked further down the alley and near the restaurant the line seem to pass it! The people in line were actually waiting to visit Picasso's museum! The restaurant can probably sit no more than 20-25 people (i might be wrong but the place did seem really small) anyhow, it's an open kitchen style restaurant and the waiters and the chefs were all very friendly. \u00a0We really enjoyed eating there and will definitely be back next time we are in Barcelona!",
