    "Super delicious and authentic Indian. We're vegetarian so Indian restaurants are an easy go to in a land of seafood spots. We had the naan (of course!), vegetable jalfrezi and veggie masala. We asked for the jalfrezi spicy and they delivered, yum. They also have a nice Kingfisher beer. The service was perfect. Tandoori is tucked away in a little alley in Raval. The comfortable outdoor seating (definitely eat outside) lead to a nice people watching experience away from the trendier tourist districts in the Gothic and Born areas. Highly recommended \u00a0and we'll be back.",
