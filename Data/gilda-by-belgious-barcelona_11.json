    "We were a group of 14, organising monthly a diner. This time we choose Belgium cuisine at Gilda by Belgious. Food was great, atmosphere was nice, service was good, and the free chupitos were tasty. For starter we had the Belgian cheese and shrimp crockets, Mussels \u00e0 la Belge, humus, and pan con tomate, a marvellous start! After we had Stoofvlees with fries and mayonaise, steak frit with pepper sauce and tuna tataki, again yummie! For desert dame blanche and lemon sorbet with vodka and chocolate mousse, the perfect ending. We definetly will come back soon!",
