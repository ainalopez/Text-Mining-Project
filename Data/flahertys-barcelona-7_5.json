    "So, you're in Barcelona. It's a place on your bucket list, it's a place on your significant other's bucket list, maybe it's just where the cruise ship stopped.You've walked Las Ramblas, you're pretty much done with tapas, paella and Sangria (the Holy Trinity), and you think, \"I need a pint.\"First, get a pint. This is a pub, after all. Then, order some Irish Nachos - not really Irish, not really nachos, just awesomeness on a plate.Sandwiches are good. Everything seems reasonably priced, especially compared to places on Las Ramblas.There are a lot of expats here, so be ready for cheering for random sports events. Also, be ready for people on the patio cheering for a game showing inside, so unless you recognize their jerseys, you may never know what they're on about.Staff is friendly. Service is quick. Food is good. \u00a0For once in Barcelona, you don't have to ask for English menus.It's strange to write \"not a lot of locals here\", but given their target audience, perhaps that's not an issue. I get the feeling this is not about exporting \"Irish\" culture (Yorkshire pudding? Really?), it's about providing a place for the homesick who just can't deal with the Hard Rock again.",
