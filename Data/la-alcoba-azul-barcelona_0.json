    "This place lived up to my high expectations and then some. The waitstaff was actually having fun while providing a great service which goes a long way towards setting up an enjoyable atmosphere. The decor is rustic, warm and inviting. The music is old upbeat standards mixed with bluesy takes on new poppy hits, makes you tap your feet as you devour their absolutely delicious menu items. Would highly recommend! P.S. Get the Sangria.",
