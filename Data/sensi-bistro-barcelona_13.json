    "This was our first meal during a 4 day stay in Barcelona and a favorite for some members of our group. The staff was friendly \u00a0and escorted us from the full location to the nearly empty identical one down the street. The duck and octopus were favorites, as was the ubiquitous but always delicious jamon. The cheese platter was underwhelming, but I think the cheeses of this region tend to be fairly mild to my palate. Would recommend this as a decent intro to tapas for anyone visiting this area.",
