    "Dive, local experience. I highly recommend the marinated salmon, super fresh and yummy. We had the 2nd round of it. I normally don't eat fried food but I love artichokes. So I ended up ordering the fried artichokes to try, they were good. Very affordable meal and interesting experience. Note: no a/c if u go in the summer.No English menu, the girl would explain to you what they have. Or go see yourself at the tapas bar for cold items.",
