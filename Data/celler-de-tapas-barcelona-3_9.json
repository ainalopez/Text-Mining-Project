    "Visiting Barcelona, I had been warned it could be hard to find decent food, that one might really have to look around at bit. I stumbled upon this place and really enjoyed the food and the staff.I had the calamari which was wonderfully done, lightly battered and not at all chewy. I like the fact they have dishes outside of traditional tapas \u00a0my husband particularly enjoyed the chicken skewer with soy glaze and a tasty potato salad. The sangria was also quite nice. Staff were very good. It's a shame the prior reviewer had such a poor experience..I liked it so much I went here twice during my 4 day stay.",
