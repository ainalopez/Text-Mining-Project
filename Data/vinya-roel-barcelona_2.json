    "Vinya-Roel is one of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona serving authentic catalan food but is also an excellent wine shop with really good Spanish wines at reasonable prices and at no extra cost in the restaurant which makes the meal a good deal. Try Marques de Vargas for \u20ac33 and then a priorat for the beef.As usual in Barcelona, dinners starts around 9 but they do serve earlier.I love their tapas and the owners are very nice people recommending good food and can also make dishes off the menu, like a whole piece of entrec\u00f4te (prime run) for a larger table.Be adventurous and don't for your standard order. Nice surprise, trust me---------Try take reservations, accept all credit cads, good for groups",
