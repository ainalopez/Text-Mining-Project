    "My friend Angie found this place for us to try and I am so glad we came here!We ordered the sampler - good seafood all around - calamari, clams, croquettes, prawns, jalape\u00f1o peppers. \u00a0This was definitely worth it to try different foods.Shoe string Fries with fried eggs - oh my gosh it was sooooooooo good! Never thought egg yolk and crunchy fries could taste this amazing.Sangria - lots of fruit, alcohol content wasn't very high but it was deliciousFoie gras baguette - we ordered this go, i would say skip this item. The foie gras really tasted like liverwurst.Yes, they speak English too! Very friendly staff and owner - they even told me where I can go for horchata :) \u00a0Overall, a very comfortable atmosphere - bright lighting, not cramped.",
