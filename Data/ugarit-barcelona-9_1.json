    "I got the super ugurat plate. It was incredible. First time having Syrian food and I wasn't disappointed. It was \u20ac16,50 for the huge plate. All the meats were well seasoned and flavorful aside from the chicken, that was dry. Another great thing was that a light dessert and tea was complimentary to the meal. The black tea infused with mint and sugar was amazing!! Would definitely recommend this place if you looking to get stuffed and still eat good.",
