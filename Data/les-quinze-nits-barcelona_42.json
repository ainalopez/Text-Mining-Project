    "Menu del dia for 10 euros. It came with drink, bread, 1st, 2nd course, and dessert. Not a bad deal at all! This place was crowded at lunch time, so we opted to sit indoors, which was fine since I didn't want to breathe cigarette smoke for an hour anyways. Service was fast, food came out quick. Portions were slightly smaller than other menu del dias that I've eaten, but I didn't care. The food wasn't overly salty, which I found was the case for many other restaurants around. Even though I wasn't blown away by the meal, \u00a0it was still very enjoyable with a very nice atmosphere.",
