    "Want to eat like a king? Go here and get the Menu of the Day for lunch!For 15 Eur, each person got all of the appetizers on assorted menu, a main course, a drink, a dessert and a cafe. YES all this food. By the end of the meal, I just wanted to find the closest bed and take the longest siesta!The service was great - they were really nice and accommodating. Food was delicious - paella was GREAT, check out my picture. \u00a0A real gem in the Vila Olimpica area. Recommended!",
