    "This was the first place we went to in Barcelona and loved it. \u00a0This was our first time experiencing the local tapas/pintxos and it was kind of exciting. \u00a0You walk up and grab pintxos on toothpicks or if you can grab a seat you can order off the tapas menu. We ordered patatas \u00a0bravas which we enjoyed and the pintxos were excellent.",
