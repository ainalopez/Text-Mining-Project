    "Horrific staff ruin good food. We came here last Sunday night and ordered food for take away. The service was terrible, but the food made up for it.Tonight, I walked in with a cane (knee tumor) and asked for take away. Tonight they called me a liar, insinuating we couldn't have ordered take away ad they don't do that. Mind you, this waitress was eating sloppily in front if me while talking. They don't know what they are doing at Red Ant amd they've lost my business forever due to their ass hole staff.",
