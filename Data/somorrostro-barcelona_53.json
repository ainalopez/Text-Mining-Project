    "Lovely place. \u00a0I went there for the Sunday 1400 to 1600 \u00a0time so no idea what difference, if any, there is from the nite menus.I ended up getting their 7 course tasting menu, which I normally never do. \u00a0They had so many things I wanted to try on their menu though that I figured it would be a great way to do it (I knew it would be my only time there).I had a scallop tartare, zucchini flowers, lobster soup, skate, veal, yogurt with a chocolate crumble and a pistachio coffee cake (along with a desert wine). \u00a0All very nice and much more complex than I've described.Also they are part of the Slow Food movement and list that along several dishes.",
