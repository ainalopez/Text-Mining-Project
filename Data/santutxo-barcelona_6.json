    "Probably my favorite in Barcelona. Not far from the hostel we were staying at, it looked shabby at first. However once you step to the back it becomes completely different. The owner/chef warmly greeted us and gave us a brief background of what he and the place was about. I knew we made the right choice when I smelled fresh prawns being cooked for the paella. The menu was small but everything seemed delicious. The chef even gave me and my friend a house wine that was simply amazing. The best part was that it had to be drunk out of a spout instead of the typical glass.Im definitely coming back. Words cant really explain it but thats what pictures are for",
