    "The staff at our hotel recommended Cachitos for tapas. Being American, we thought going at noon would be perfect time for lunch. However, according to Spanish time, noon time was still breakfast time and lunch service didn't start until 1pm, so we had breakfast here. We simply had some eggs and ham, and it came with the popular Spanish tomato bread. We also ordered churros con chocolate which was amazing! We tried this dessert at another place and it did not compare to this one. The churros were so crispy and the hot chocolate was the perfect complement. We came back that night for dinner because we wanted to try their tapas. We were seated outside and ordered paella and garlic shrimp. The garlic shrimp was good but the paella was exceptional. It had great flavors and was a generous portion. The ambiance and staff were both great. Overall, a solid restaurant right in the middle of the busy part of town.",
