    "Fantastic, service with a smile regardless of our useless/non existent Spanish. A great introduction into the Barca tapas culture, would 100% bring friends to this place next time. A little bit off of las ramblas but absolutey worth the detour, a highlight was the duck dish (I forget the specifics) and the cheese platter.",
