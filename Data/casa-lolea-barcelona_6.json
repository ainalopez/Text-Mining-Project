    "We managed to get a table for 4 as a walk in although the restaurant was pretty packed. We were initially told it would be a bit of a wait, but maybe there was a last minute cancellation? Would certainly suggest others make a reservation. The service was great and the food was even better - every dish hit the mark. We drank the sangria #3 and loved it. During our travels, we came across their sangria #1 at another restaurant and it too was great, although our favorite is still #3. We spent about 10 days going across Spain and our group agreed that this was the best tapas meal. Also managed to find some retailers in the US that carry the sangria, so stocked up on the #3!",
