    "I went to this little cocktail bar with a friend for my birthday while visiting Barcelona, and it was absolute perfect! I loved every bit of it.The bar is not very big, but it has a great cosy atmosphere. We got a seat at the bar which was quite lucky because minutes later the bar was packed (without being too crowded).We got to try different cocktails during the night with everything from passions fruit drinks to royal mojito with caba. And all of them were yummy!The staff were very casual and friendly yet still passionate in the making of the drinks. They had great humor but not in the tacky kind of bartender-way. And not least, the music was great - \u00a0a mix of good old classics and new ones.All in all, everything was perfect and it will be a birthday I won't forget and a place I definately will recommend others to go to for a great night with fab drinks, cool music and authentic atmosphere.",
