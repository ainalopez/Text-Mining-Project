    "I did research for a few hours on where to eat paella in Barcelona. Several guides recommended 7 Portes and after reading about their history, I decided to give them my business.Did not disappoint! My wife and I came around 3pm on a weekday and there was no line and a lightly dispersed crowd dining. I could imagine it being packed during rush hour.We got the rich man's paella, salad, and sangria. Reasonably priced for the quality and a great dish of paella. Hope they're open for another 200 years!",
