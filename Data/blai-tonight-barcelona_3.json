    "3.5.The Tapas was OK. \u00a0We scored a seat on the patio, and the waiter will come out and get you drinks. \u00a0Then you go to the bar and grab stuff. \u00a0They ask you the table number and bring it out to you after heating the items in. \u00a0Bacon and fried quail egg on bread was not only cute but delish. Salt cod croquettes were crispy and creamy. \u00a0Very cheap and cheerful. \u00a0But beware, part of the patio sits over a sewer and it can become a little smelly at times.",
