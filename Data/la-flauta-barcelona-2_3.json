    "I loved La Flauta. All of our servers we really friendly. They helped us pick out a wine for my friend who loves sweet white wines. The first choice we picked would not have been good for our meal- our friend ordered it with dessert, and it was like honey. They suggested another wine instead, and it was perfect for our meal.There is a long line for this restaurant. We put our name in and then went and got gin and tonics down the street.I would definitely go back.",
