    "Do not miss eating here. It is omakase style tapas- the waiter asks if there are things you don't like, and boom- tapas are just brought. It's very crowded and expensive but all worth it.I started w some tuna tartar on a potato dish- it looked amazing and tasted better. Next, was potatoes and steak- so flavorful. Last I had sliced ham - sliced from the leg sitting there. It's how they roll in Spain . The staff wAs outstanding . Well worth it!",
