    "Wow - what a find! \u00a0Right on the same block as our hotel! \u00a0They serve exclusively pinxos, which are small open faced sandwiches layered with heavenly ingredients -- it's self-serve -- grab some and sit down, and they will get your drink. And then get up and get more. And more. Yum. Very reasonable prices. Sorry we found this on our last day... Only drawback is they don't have outdoor seating.",
