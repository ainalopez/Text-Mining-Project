    "We went to Cafe de l'Academia on the reccomendation of a local friends advice. It was crowded from the start with all the early American diners. It was hard to get the waiters attention and interaction with us at the table wasn't very friendly, rushed and curt. Food was nothing special. My husbands steak was good, but nothing to write home about.",
