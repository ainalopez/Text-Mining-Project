    "I ADORED this place. From the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall. when you walk in you're transported into an authentic tapas restaurant. We got by just fine with English, but we noticed we were the only \"tourists\" inside. We did make friends with the guy at the charcuterie counter, as he let us back there to take photos with him. Another man, who seemed like a regular came over and had a 10 minute conversation with me in Spanish. Even though I don't speak or understand any Spanish.The tapas they have may not even be there the next day, but we loved the mixed seafood, artichokes, cheese, and I asked for Iberico jamon.Upside: Authentic, delicious food, friendly serversDownside: Not as many choices, don't get the pan con tomate (there's better everywhere else!)",
