    "Great food and wine, but everything else is pretty bad. If you're coming here for the experience, I would think twice. And honestly, if you're coming here for the food, you can probably get it cheaper elsewhere. We had the chicken and rice paella, veggie cannelloni, lamp chops, and sea bass. All good. 7 Portes wine also great. Our servers rarely came by the table. A lot of bugs for a fancy place.",
