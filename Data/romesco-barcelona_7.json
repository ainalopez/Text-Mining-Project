    "Everything here --and we ordered meat, fish and vegetable dishes --was overcooked, mushy and inedible it was so awful! \u00a0Those other reviews must be friends and family. \u00a0After a long 5 hour bus ride we were ready to eat anything so we yelped and found this place had great reviews. The food was so awful tasting I was afraid I'd get sick so I just took a couple bites of each. What a horrible experience my first visit to Barcelona and a big waste of money since we had to find a whole new place to eat after paying for untouched food.",
