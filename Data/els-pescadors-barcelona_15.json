    "Wow - had a fantastic dinner here! I have been to Barcelona several times previously but had never heard of Els Pescadors until a colleague of mine found it online and recommended we check it out. A little hard to find (even the taxi driver had a hard time) but really nice locals feeling spot with fantastic service once you arrive. We went on a Tuesday or Wednesday night at about 9 or 9:30, and were basically the only people in the restaurant even when we left 2 hours later. \u00a0I suppose it can get quite busy on the weekends but it was eerily quiet the night we were there. Basic menu of fish and sea food but all prepared nicely. \u00a0Foie gras starter is PLENTY big for 2 people to share (unless you REALLLLY like Foie) and should not be missed, they do Foie 3-4 different ways so there should be a preparation for everyone.Not inexpensive, but I will go back.",
