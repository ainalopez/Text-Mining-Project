    "2 words: Hot Chocolate.Truth be told, you can throw a rock in this town and get the most amazing hot chocolate, but since that's all I had there, this place gets the review.We need this stuff in the rest of the world, thick, syrupy, more like chocolate soup than anything else.If anyone ever offers me \"Swiss Miss\" again, I'm going to slap them.Oh, yeah, and the place had comfy chairs and an excellent view. A good place to spend a afternoon.",
