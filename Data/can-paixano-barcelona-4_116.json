    "One of those places you just have to go in Barcelona. I make it a point to try eclectic places while I'm living here and this was by far the best experience! It's loud, packed to the brim, ridiculously cheap, and ridiculously delicious. It gets hot in here and really crowded, but that's the mark of an amazing place. Filled with foreigners and locals alike, I really seriously recommend the cava rosado. I know I'll be buying a few bottles for friends and family--it's that good. Food is freshly made and all together a must visit! You won't regret it!",
