    "Great little find in Barcelona and it \u00a0deserves all 5 stars. So the general idea here is ... order a few tapas for the table and then everybody orders a Pepita. For tapas we ordered the seabass with spinach and strawberries, fried aubergine fritters in goat cheese sauce, the patatas bravas (best we had in Barcelona) and the hummus and each one of them was not only presented uniquely but also tasted wonderful. Great wine selection as well!",
