    "I'm a big ramen connoisseur, and this is probably one of the three best I've ever had. I showed up five minutes before they opened for Friday dinner and was surprised to see a line stretching down the block. I waited 60 minutes (to eat alone!) before being seated at a shared table. I noticed that people waiting in line were given beers on request -- classy.The service is quick and efficient. I had the miso ramen -- the broth was perfect, the pork was juicy (although you only get one slice?!), and the vegetables were fresh. The noodles were the weakest part, I've had better, but even those deserve a 4/5.Typical reasonable Barna prices. I'll definitely come back here again... maybe on a weeknight, though.",
