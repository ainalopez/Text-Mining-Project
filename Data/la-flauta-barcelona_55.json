    "If you are in Barcelona, you MUST go here. I hate going to touristy places and always ask locals for recommendations. I heard about this place through a friend who was a chef in France and my taxi driver. A lot of locals love this place and there is a line to get seated but it moves really fast. My cousin and I sat outside next to two locals. I told them we were Mexican and that this was our first restaurant in Barcelona and asked for recommendations. Long story short, we joined tables and had a feast (wine, food, dessert, and espresso). My favorites: flauta de jamon, montadito de solomillo, patatas bravas, crema catalana, tapa de foie. My mouth is watering.",
