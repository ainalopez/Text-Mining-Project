    "Come here for the architecture or the novelty of sitting in the same seats where Picasso once Sat. Don't come here for the sangria or service. We were ignored and not shown to a seat for 5 minutes even though there were seats everywhere. The sangria also has a weird aftertaste and very sugary. This place is definitely riding off its reputation for being Picasso's hangout. Admire from the outside and move on.If you do come, ask for a table in the back. The door keeps opening and letting in cold air, and the patrons don't have the courtesy to close it behind them.",
