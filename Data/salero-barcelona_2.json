    "My fianc\u00e9 and I stumbled into salero while we were wandering the streets of el born around 2300. We only ordered two dishes to share- some beef and vegetable gyoza and tuna avocado spring roll type dish. Let me tell you, the spring roll was melt in your mouth! We couldn't tell the difference between the texture of the tuna and the texture of the avocado. It was on the pricier side comparatively but not outrageous. All in all definitely recommend!",
