    "Pinchos (or pintxos) are a sort of food served here in Spain, particularly in the northern region know as Euskadi (Basque Country). It consists of a bread base on top of which sits some kind of meat, fish, omelet or vegetable. There's a wide choice of those, some of them more refined than other but nonetheless always nice. The price commonly ranges between 1.5\u20ac and 3\u20ac (sometimes it includes a small serve of beer or wine as well, but usually doesn't).Although pintxos were not born in Barcelona, we've adopted the tradition and can be found everywhere in the city.The \"Txapela\" is a sort of traditional hat used in the Euskadi and also gives the name to this restaurant chain which food used to be much better that it is now.While some of my previous experiences there had been greatly pleasant, it wasn't so the last two times I've been. Let me expose some details.I know accurately how Cod omelet looks and tastes, and I cannot accept beeing refuted by the attendant when I complain about having been served zucchini omelet instead.Additionally, here in Spain, we have some clearly defined beer sizes (from smaller to larger: ca\u00f1a, copa, jarra and pinta). I expect that when asking for a ca\u00f1a (the smaller) to be served as requested but instead I severed a jarra, just because it what tourists demand the most. Unacceptable.",
