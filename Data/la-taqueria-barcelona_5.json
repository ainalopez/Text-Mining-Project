    "Was nearly empty when we arrived at 6. The tacos (chicken and beef) were good, although they leaned more in the direction of authentic and simple, and the beef taco was a tad underseasoned for my palate. One of the only places that prices Coke reasonably, which I appreciated.It's down an alley, but don't expect budget prices. They'll charge an extra euro per 4 taco plate for cheese which seems high. Our order was \u20ac19 for 2 taco orders and 1 Coke. If you're used to tapas prices, that's steep.Still a good option if you're in the Sagrada Familia neighborhood, though.",
