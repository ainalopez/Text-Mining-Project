    "We tried to go to Brunch & Cake, but our party was so large they sent us here. \u00a0It was crowded but they sat us immediately. The breakfast here was basically the best breakfast I've ever had and the rest of my party agreed - SO GOOD! We'll come back here in a heartbeat the next time we are in Barcelona. We tried six different dishes and they were all amazing!",
