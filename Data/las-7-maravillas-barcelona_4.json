    "We found this little Restaurant on our weekend Trip to Barcelona. To our fortune it was situated 20m beside our hotel.The service was very kind and helpful. The food was awesome (Russian specialty). The location is designed with a great sense to a mix of modern and traditional design.On our 3 day trip we visited this restaurant two times.",
