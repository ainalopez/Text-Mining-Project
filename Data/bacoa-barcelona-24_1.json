    "I was totally floored by Bacoa's burger. I generally have lower expectations for a chain, but Bacoa blew them away.When you enter this place, you grab a tiny pencil and a checklist. \u00a0Use it to construct your personal burger masterpiece. \u00a0Hand it to the cashier, then take your light-up coaster thing to a table. \u00a0When your burger is ready, it is delivered to you.I went with La Bacoa (8.50 \u20ac) - bacon, cheddar, manchego cheese, pickles and mustard. Because I glossed over the fact that it came with bacon, I selected extra bacon for 1.20 \u20ac more. \u00a0Since I love bacon, this was merely a bonus.The burger was incredible. \u00a0Huge and packed with flavor. \u00a0I loved it.I subtract one star because my patatas r\u00fasticas were very dry. \u00a0They tasted like potatoes that had been cooked two days before and were reheated. \u00a0Considering how amazing the burger was, that was shocking.If you're looking to slay your appetite, Bacoa is a great option, especially when you've grown tired of tapas.",
