    "We popped in for a quick bite before going to Park G\u00fcell, lucky enough to have a table without reservation. We ordered the Aubergine cake and pear ravioli. Love the pear and cheese combination. Green tea tiramisu was nice as well but as the coffee and mascarpone's taste is quite strong already that it's not easy to taste the matcha. Having said that, Presentation of the dish was beautiful.",
