    "Great tapas bar and can get very crowded as the evening progresses. We got there just in time when a table by the bar opened up. The bar is s good place to sit as you can see all of the fresh ingredients and tapas being prepared. Ordered from the menu of the day and got the salted cod, grilled beef, fried artichokes, steamed mussels, and bruschetta with fig jam, fried eggplant and blood sausage. For dessert the house cake with whiskey sauce and Catalonian creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.Everything was delicious. The mussels tasted really fresh and sweet. Beef was grilled to perfection - so tender and juicy! Excellent meal and reasonably-priced. I plan to go back again before leaving Barcelona.",
