    "It was a nice chill day and Robert M organized a lunch to meet up with Sharon E. Which was awesome and Thank you Robert M for doing that. Robert M. picked a great place. Right on the money and huge portion size. I love how BCN has set menu price where you can choose from a list of goodies and it comes with a drink and coffee after. \u00a0I pretty much got the same as Robert M. \u00a0salad and 2 empanada. But I splurged and got a extra one. The salad OMG it was delish. I love the cheese they put and the cheese on top of the veggies. OH gosh whoever created my plate THANK YOU for being alive. (he he he). The food was just perfect and made me full. A little extra full with my extra empanada which was the pumpkin one. \u00a0Which was really good. \u00a0My little girl got the hamburger and potatas bravas. I was thinking a 2 buns and a burger nope it was in a empanada form. Cute. \u00a0Her potatas bravas was actually roasted and the sauce oh wow it was delish. I used it with not just the potatas but also my empanada and stuff. LOL. The staff was great. Especially since I was sitting next to 3 awesome Spanish teacher and 1 awesome cousin in law who spoke Spanish. Yay for me that is. \u00a0They have a wide selection of empanada and dessert you can pick from. All you had to do was just look at the display. Awesome... Bathroom was actually very nice and clean. I will return again!!!!!",
