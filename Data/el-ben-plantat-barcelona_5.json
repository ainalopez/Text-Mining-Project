    "We came here for our last dinner in Barcelona. With 5 stars on both Yelp & Trip Advisor it seemed an ideal choice. How right we were... Gabriella treated us like honoured guests. She shared her knowledge of Catalunyan wines with us and offered us tastings of all the wines we were interested in. The food was extraordinary and we enjoyed everything - from the mango, goats cheese & walnut salad, to calamari croquettes, to brandade and bubbling provolone with fig and walnut. It's a tiny place of just 14 covers and if you are the first/only people don't be bashful; you'll have an amazing time and you'll be joined very soon as word is spreading how good this place is. Split of guests was 50:50 visitors and locals. We had 5 dishes and 1 dessert with 6 glasses of wine for under \u20ac60. You can't beat the quality or the service.",
