    "We were hanging out La Rambla in the evening and didn't want to eat on that street given how touristy that st is. So we walked around the hood and tried to find somewhere less touristy. Thanks to Tripadvisor app, we found this place. Menu is simple and limited but was good. We tried the Sausage/peppers/onions on toast, spanish omelette on toast, grilled squid with salad and stuffed cheese hamburger. Everything was surprisingly good but funny thing is no bun on hamburger. It's a good find if you want to get a way from the touristy crowd on La Rambla.Oh cash only, we spent 33 euros (with 2 glasses of wines)",
