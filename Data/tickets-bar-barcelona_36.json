    "Tapas so fancy and delicious it got a Michelin star!You have the option of ordering what you want or letting the servers pick for you. With that said, we opted to pick our own based on Yelp recommended dishes:- Bread with tomato- Sangria infused watermelon- Olives-Manchego cheesePersonally I was not wowed by the bread or the watermelon. \u00a0They were good but again, nothing mind-blowing. \u00a0These 2 dishes came out first and actually had me worried that expectations were set a little too high.Next came the olives that practically melted in your mouth. \u00a0Follow this with the manchego cheese airbags and we quickly understood what the hype was all about. \u00a0This set off another round of tapas that included another order of the manchego cheese accompanied by the server recommended chicken box and the pork ribs. \u00a0Mind blown!Our server was so excited for us that he wanted to surprise us for dessert. \u00a0What came was a trio of deliciousness and an experience like no other! \u00a0We had this chocolate-filled sponge cake shaped like corks followed by a peach sangria poured in front of you accompanied by a faux peach 'seed' that I can't even describe. \u00a0We ended the wonderful experience with a lemon meringue ice cream prepped on an ice cream cart complete with bells and a blow torch. \u00a0Needless to say, it was a pretty awesome show for that side of the restaurant. \u00a0The last dish pretty much epitomizes what Tickets emphasizes most: taste and presentation. \u00a0If you plan on heading to Barcelona, do your research and book your reservation 2 months in advance!",
