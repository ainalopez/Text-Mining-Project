    "I came to this restaurant on the earlier side 9:00 pm without a reservation and was seated immediately.The view from the covered patio was charming and the service was excellent. I shared the Bacalao \"esqueixat\" and fried calamari. Both had clean simple flavors. Despite my tenancy not to order let alone review a common fried appetizer in the calamari, it was worth noting. \u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed the shoulder of baked goat or better known as braise goat shank. My partner praised the hake cheeks in a light lemon cream sauce as excellent. Pricing was on the high side, as many restaurants near the tourist areas tend to be.",
