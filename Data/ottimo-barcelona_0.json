    "I absolutely love this place. Out of the many many many ice cream places I've been to in Barcelona, this is one of the best. The store is beautiful, and next to a beautiful plaza, and the people are nice. There are many different delicious flavors. They also serve orxata I believe, so that's a good thing to know. Totally recommend it, this place is amazing.",
