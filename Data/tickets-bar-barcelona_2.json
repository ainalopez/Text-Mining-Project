    "Despite the fact that Yelp is not as highly utilized in Barcelona, I still would like to dedicate some time to tell you all how amazing Tickets is. If you're reading this, you already know the backstory on Albert Adria and the ingenuity he and his brother have instilled on the culinary world. As such, I will just say this: tickets is by far one of the top 5 dining experiences of my life. What made it extra enjoyable was just how fun and friendly the environment was - from the very moment you are greeted at the door, to my final bite of the layered ice cream/crema/pie filling cone dessert that is masked with corks (I'll spare everyone my unsophisticated ways of trying to describe Mr. Adria's creative genius). Finally, yes, the liquid olives are as amazing in taste and feel as you would expect. Reservation tip: Make sure to set a calendar alert properly to snag a reservation -also make sure that the time is set for the restaurant's local time. Instructions and reservation rules may change, so I suggest to check out their website and read carefully. Also keep in mind the days that they are closed.",
