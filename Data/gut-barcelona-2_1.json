    "We went for lunch on a Saturday and had some great little dishes pad Thai and sirloin steak). The options were all good more generally. They could be had as tapas, though are bigger and priced accordingly. Expect about \u20ac15 for a main. The area around there is lovely, though the atmosphere of Gut is not as good as elsewhere we went. E.g. Menus laminated undermined pretty nice decor.",
