    "I really fancied some good fish when I was in Barcelona. This is not such an easy thing in this city because there are loads of restaurants and many of them are just a trap for tourists, either because they look really fancy and they're insanely expensive or because they're cheap but the food is terrible. There's a third option, which is the one that worked for me most of the times in Spain: looking for restaurant that look cheap where the food is great (in other cities of Spain they're also not expensive, it's not the case in Barcelona). This restaurant belongs to this category and it was the best experience I had during my trip in Barcelona. This is a family run business and they are truly nice and friendly \u00a0not because they want to trick you. They don't really speak English but they make you understand what the menu is about \u00a0oh by the way there's no menu, the waiter is the menu. :) My suggestion would be take a mixed dish, and then eventually order something you really liked from that. The fish is always fresh, which is quite easy for them since the Mercado Sta. Caterina is directly in front of it. One last thing: ask for the prices. Dinner here wasn't cheap, but considering the quality of the food honest. The only thing that surprised me was the price of a mixed grilled plate, which was a bit too high for me, also with respect to the other dishes we had. Nothing TOO disappointing, but still to be kept in mind.",
