    "A wonderful lunch or dinner deal in Barna: a drink, very satisfying/gratifying Italian food, and a great dessert all for just under 10 euros/person. The service is also very good and helpful; the woman working at the ordering counter took a good bit of time to explain the set up of the joint and ordering, and even recommended dishes based on us being vegetarian and still wanting to experience their range of goodies. We got some ravioli (with pine nuts and arugula), the vegetarian lasagna (a true treat with a delicious use of leeks and walnuts!), a lovely glass of wine, and their tiramisu and dulce de leche bar (both of which I thought were outstanding). A great option for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike--and a reprieve from all of the cured meat culinary focus in Spain.",
