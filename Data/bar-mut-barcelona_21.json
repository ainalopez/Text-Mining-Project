    "I came here while vacationing in Barcelona on the recommendation of the front desk at my hotel. \u00a0This was one of the best meals of my life! \u00a0A little pricey for Spain, but 100% worth it! \u00a0The host came over to sit with us, asked us about what we wanted, how hungry we were, etc. \u00a0There was no \"menu,\" so it felt like we were being catered to. \u00a0Everything was delicious. \u00a0Would return!",
