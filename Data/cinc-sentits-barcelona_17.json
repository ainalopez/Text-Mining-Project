    "I am surprised that this restaurant has only 1 Michelin star. It is by far my favourite restaurant, beating out all the other 1 and 2 Michelin star restaurants that I have tried across the world. Not only is it best in class for Catalan cuisine, but its tasting menu is truly worth a detour if you're in the Barcelona area. Every single dish was well-conceived, creative, and executed perfectly with outstanding culinary finesse. Further, the service was impeccable -- they didn't bother you too much but they were always available if you needed them (with only 10 tables in the restaurant, they are truly dedicated to providing you with excellent customer service). Further, its ambiance was far from pretentious, which when coupled with delicious food, hints at a perfect restaurant.",
