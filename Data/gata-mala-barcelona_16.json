    "Gata Mala has consistently been an excellent and tantalizing experience. This is what I would consider a true neighborhood tapas bar. Not that I'm an expert, but there is no menu to be found, you simply point at what you want in the glass case of deliciousness, or ask if they have something. Everything I have eaten here (admittedly, I don't even know what some of the things are) is simply amazing, especially the eggplant. Be prepared to stand. The place has been packed each time I have been there, despite the fact they open earlier than most other places in Gracia, which I believe is a testament to Gata Mala's cool vibe and tasty tapas. The staff is impressive, seemingly memorizing a million orders at once and never forgetting a drink, tapa, or check- and all in a tiny bar and kitchen area. Also a plus: each drink earns you a free tapa. I also received free wine top-offs and unlimited bread- yay!",
