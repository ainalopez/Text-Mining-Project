    "We were staying in Poble Sec and found so many bars / restaurants within a one minute walk of the apartment it was rude not to try as many as possible.We ended up here on our last night in Barcelona. We were planning to hit Quimet & Quimet which is well regarded in the area but found it was closed on a Saturday ( maybe it's their night to party!) so popped our head round this busy & very authentic looking tapas bar. We spied a couple of seats at the bar & started to ponder the chalkboard menu ( all in Spanish).It's been a long time for me since my Spanish GCSE so took a punt & requested some meat & fish tapas ( alongside a glass of white & a beer).The morcilla & chorizo arrived quickly & were very flavoursome. Following this the salmoneta arrived - a salmon dip with some chorizo in. It probably isn't something i d pick but was tasty & went well with the bread sticks & sausage! Sheep's cheese was warm from the bar which brought out all of the flavour. The best dish ( which may be our favourite dish of the trip) was a cone of different types of fried fish including white bait & some fantastically citrus fish nuggets. We finished it off with another wine & beer, some tuna on bread & a vermouth each (1 euro, 50!) which is a local speciality. All of this came to around 30 euro with a 10 % tip for that amount of booze & food was pretty good! The atmosphere was very cool, great music ( which was unusual as other bars had no music).",
