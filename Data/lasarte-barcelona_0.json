    "May this world be established with a sense ofwell-being and happiness ~ Lokah SamasthaWell deserving of their two Michelin Stars, Lasarte is a sensational encounter of balance, refinement, flavor, service and atmosphere. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening here.I experienced the Lasarte Menu and wine pairing. In typical fashion, it's a menu that changes seasonally. Having been to a little more than a dozen Michelin Star restaurants, I'm by no means an expert, but found Lasarte to be exceptional. I expected the food and service to be outstanding and it was. But what made Lasarte so special is more difficult to describe. Like many equivalent restaurants, the tasting menu at Lasarte is an event--an experience unto itself. It wasn't the best food time I ever had or anything like that, but it was, in a way, perfect. There are moments in life when you feel more in sync with the world around you. Instances when the ebb and flow, the rhythm, of life matches the soul...or breath... or energy within you. In these times everything works and everything fits right. The ambiance was lovely, but that's not what I'm talking about. The sum was simply more than the parts for me at Lasarte. It was one of my two favorite meals of 2015 and I feel honored to have had the opportunity.So, when in Rome...or Barcelona in this case...",
