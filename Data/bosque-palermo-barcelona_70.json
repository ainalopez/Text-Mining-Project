    "I have never had paella till I went here and my god was it amazing. The rice was perfectly seasoned and paired perfectly with plethora of seafood. The seafood included mussells, clams, scallops and prawns. I wish I could go back to eat it. Don't forget to get a pitcher of sangria while you are at it. Just be wary of how much you drink because it's delicious.",
