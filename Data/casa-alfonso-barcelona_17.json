    "Spending a week in Spain, someplace is going to be the worst meal. This was it for us. \u00a0The \"tomato bread\" was the worst -- soggy pieces of wheat bread, soaked in olive oil (literally dripping), with smudges of tomato on top. \u00a0We had far better tomato bread elsewhere. \u00a0I ordered the black risotto with cuttlefish, and it was okay but not particularly tasty -- and again, I had much better elsewhere. \u00a0My wife ordered the steak with the reduced wine sauce which was so sweet that it tasted candied. \u00a0The service was barely adequate. Casa Alfonso wasn't *terrible* (except for the tomato bread). \u00a0It's just that Barcelona is really great in general, and Casa Alfonso was kind of the Denny's of Barcelona cuisine. \u00a0It was okay, but you could do much better. \u00a0Definitely not a 4 or 5 star experience.",
