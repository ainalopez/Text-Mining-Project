    "EASILY my favorite visit of my entire time in Spain! \u00a0It is truly a shame if you miss out on the pinxos experience, and this place takes the cake. \u00a0There are plates full of small sandwiches and appetizer like foods and you fill up your plate cafeteria style. \u00a0When you are ready to pay, they simply add up the toothpicks. \u00a0It is SUCH a fun way to eat and you can try so many different things, eat only a small meal, or just get to see what there is to offer before you eat.This place gets BUSY so you need to go early (7ish) or late (10ish) if you want a chance at a table.",
