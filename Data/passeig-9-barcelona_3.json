    "Being in Barcelona for the first time it's quite overwhelming and the range of restaurants is HUGE! Never eat at the big shoppingstreet called La Rambla because the food is really bad and expensive.Take the opportunity to ask the locals and find the best food at cosy restaurants and for a cheaper price. Anyhow we lived near the beach and was told to try the restaurants near our hotel,which was located in the area near Rambla Publenou. We just happened to ending up at this place by accident and I'm glad we did! This is the place to be! Delicious food and really nice wine for a good price! The atmosphere is cosy and you feel really welcome. The service is excellent and people are so friendly there! The boss of this place is such a warm and nice person so please take the time to thank him for the best food in Barcelona!",
