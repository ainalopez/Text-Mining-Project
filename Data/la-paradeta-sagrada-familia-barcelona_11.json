    "Loved it so much!!! \u00a0We ate there twice in two days! \u00a0It was absolute heaven on a plate and a fun fresh experience that you customize to your liking. \u00a0After being carb loaded in France for weeks, \u00a0it was so nice to have fresh protein and veggie options cooked to order. \u00a0If you don't go here, you are missing a true gem. \u00a0It has great energy and lines, but it goes fast. \u00a0Don't let the lines deter you- so worth it. \u00a0Plus, \u00a0it gives you time to plan out your feast and don't worry about knowing exact weights, \u00a0they help you! \u00a0You walk up to the counter and through the excellent guidance of the staff, \u00a0you point out your selections and they help you determine quantities. \u00a0For most options, \u00a0you have the choice of fried or grilled. \u00a0Salads and bread are available too.We had a bit of every option. \u00a0My favorites were the clams and muscles in a light marinara. \u00a0Everyone in our party loved it (that's rare). \u00a0I was sad to leave Barcelona knowing I couldn't go back. \u00a0Please let there be something similar in the U.S.!!!!To be honest, \u00a0I think I could eat there everyday and never get tired of it! \u00a0:)Do yourself a favor and put this at the top of your list!",
