    "Spectacular!!! I was worried that Tickets would not live up to the hype and anticipation...silly me. It is truly a feast for the senses. The d\u00e9cor is fun and fantastical...the service is stellar....and the food...oh, the food....fan-TAB-ulous! Each course is lovingly created and stunning in presentation. We went with the option of letting our waiter choose our plates, and I'm glad we did. Two plus hours of tapas-sized tastes of perfection! Although everything was wonderful, 2 particular dishes make my mouth water as I remember them. The first was the signature Olive dish. (How do they do these?? It's basically olive skins filled with liquid that pop with flavor in your mouth. Wow.) I seriously wanted to go back a couple of days later, and just ask for this dish. It is truly unique and a must-try. \u00a0The other dish which has taken up a permanent spot in my mind was the dessert cheese. It was creamy, delicious goodness. I've never had anything else like it. What a spectacular way to end the meal. So, even though it's quite tough to get reservations for Tickets, it's definitely worth the effort. And quite reasonably priced at only about 200 Euros for 2 people (including a couple of pre-meal drinks and a bottle of cava). All I have to say is, it's probably a good thing this restaurant isn't located in Chicago, or I would be stalking the Website daily for reservations!",
