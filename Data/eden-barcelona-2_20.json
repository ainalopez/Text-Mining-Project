    "I just ate here for the first time tonight, and the food and the service were excellent! The server was so attentive and nice. I only found out later that she is the owner and runs it with her family. It is very reasonably priced and the menu is quite varied. Everything was delicious! I am staying a week in Barcelona and will definitely be back!**Update** I went back again two nights later and had the best fettuccine alfredo I've ever had! I can't say enough good things about this place!",
