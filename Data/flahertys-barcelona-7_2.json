    "So there you are, in Barcelona, so many things to do, so many things to see and yet you find yourself in search of an Irish pub cause the rugby is on.Flaherty's was the second on we came across but the first one to show the match. Atmosphere was good with a mix of locals and rugby-addicted tourists alike, all having a drink and watching the game. I got a bit home sick.The service was exceptional. Friendliest, smiliest waitress in all BCN I'd say, quick to take our order and quick to serve as well. We had a few beers and some food; BLT and chips para senior and pasta salad with olives and grilled chicken para mi. Both were very nice pub grub options and just perfect for the occasion. I definitely recommend Flaherty's for any sports needs you may have, lots of screens, free wifi, Irish draught and craft beers, nice food and friendly service. As if you've never left the home.",
