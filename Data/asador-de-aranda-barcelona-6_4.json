    "what's with all the negative reviews? \u00a0i don't get it! \u00a0I had a great experience. \u00a0Good thing i tried it for myself and not get influenced by the previous reviews.First off - the building housing this restaurant is spectacular - so the setting was a treat in itself.Second - the service was gracious, friendly & prompt. \u00a0And though my friends (who did all the ordering) are native barcelonans and could navigate between castellano & catalan seamlessly, the servers joked around with me in their broken english... no snobbery whatsoever. \u00a0Food: \u00a0we had the baby lamb as the main course - sooo good. \u00a0I'd never had such young lamb before - and this meat was tender and just fell off the bone. \u00a0And the blood sausage (I can't believe i'm about to admit this) was the best thing ever. \u00a0Sometimes i just abandon my food issues, and adopt that Anthony Bourdain philosophy of just going for it & trying what the locals eat. \u00a0I'm glad i did - because although i've had awful blood sausage (murcillo) in the past - this one was so delicious, i ate the last piece on the dish.The place is expensive, but considering the whole - presentation, setting, food, quality - i think it was priced accordingly. \u00a0definitely good for a special occasion. \u00a0especially if you like lamb.",
