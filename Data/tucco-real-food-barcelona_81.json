    "We've been back to this restaurant several times since my first review and I have to rave about the vegetarian lasagna - I'm not a lasagna fan but tried Tucco's because of the Yelp reviews and now I'm a die hard fan. It's incredible! The flavors are rich and complex, and I love the crunch if walnuts in it. We also tried the Milanese sandwich a couple times, ricotta ravioli and a mushroom ravioli of the day. All were delicious! Definitely our favorite hole in the wall restaurant in Barcelona!",
