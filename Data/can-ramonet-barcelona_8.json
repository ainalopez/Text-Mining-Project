    "Our second time here. Had best monkfish ever, sauce was rich yet not too creamy tomato based with fresh herbs--excellent and the fish was perfectly cooked. Had monkfish many times before and often tough and over cooked. Duck was also very good with a delicious syrup-like reduction that was hearty and rich. Seabass with potatoes also a winner, potatoes with peppers made a perfect combination. Angel was our server who was somewhat knowledgeable of English. He Made it fun communicating, he was patient and honest about choices guiding us when we had questions. We finished with chocolate coulant---simply a terrific ending.",
