    "I cant tell you enough how much I loved this place. As soon as I walked in the staff was playful and cheerful dressed in al Capone attire and shooting fake guns. Once the waiter was so nice to seat us without a reservation (they were booked) we ordered their signature blueberry mojito. Went down so easy! We order the croquettes, octopus, scallops, and creamy duck rice. Everything was top notch and at a decent price. At the end they gave us a delicious free shot. One of the wait stuff suggested calling us a taxi and even waited with us and hailed it down! Top notch service and food!",
