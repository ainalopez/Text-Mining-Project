    "The food here was innovative and delicious. \u00a0The service was a little stand-offish, but generally nice. \u00a0The pasta and fish dishes we had here were really good. \u00a0The salad was also quite tasty and something we might try to recreate at home. \u00a0Like many of our other favorite restaurants in Barcelona, this wasn't necessarily \"spanish\" food, it was just wordly delicious food. \u00a0You can make reservations online. \u00a0Definitely do that!",
