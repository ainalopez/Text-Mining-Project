    "Good Food, Small Space, Generally need a reservation to get a table. Plan ahead.Good tapas bar with tasty bites. The tuna skewers were very good. This was my first experience with potato bravas as well. I thought they were great so I ordered some in a few other places later in my trip, Seni's were better than most. In my opinion, when a restaurant prepares a local favorite and everday common dish better than most others, they know what they are doing and the rest of the food is pretty good. That theory held true in this instance.",
