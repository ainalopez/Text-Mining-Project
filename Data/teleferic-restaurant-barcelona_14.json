    "Its prob the best restorant in Barselona that I've been! \u00a0so nice area, people, FOOD, drinks ( dont forgat to try bottle of cava named Marta- best one for sure) Also you have opened table, so you can choose your own food :-) which is incredable! I love it that way! When im able to see what im eating not just to choose from the menu!!!But you also have menu so you dont need to take food from the open table :-)Enjoy your breakfast, lunch and dinner here! You all deserve the best!!!",
