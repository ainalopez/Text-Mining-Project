    "We had dinner at Sensi on the first night of our stay in Barcelona and we were totally wow-ed by the food. Each dish was very flavorful and unique, culminating in a delicious paella dish that we devoured. The server recommended a great bottle of wine that went well with everything on the menu (especially the paella). The vibe is hip and romantic, and it has a great location in the Barri Gotic. A great spot to visit for travelers!",
