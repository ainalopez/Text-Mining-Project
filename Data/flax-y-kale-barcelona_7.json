    "Go here! Tuna burger and grilled watermelon salad. End of story. We are two girls, semi-hungry and we did fine sharing these plates. This is proof that healthy food can taste good. Beautiful ambience, and the price is not that bad if you share. Juices here are 6 euros, a lot cheaper compared to NYC and LA and the same size as pressed juicery plastic bottles.",
