    "The food was terrible! \u00a0I was in during a Friday morning with a date and the place was virtually empty. \u00a0The waiter was incredibly rude and did not attempt to engage in English or Spanish, of which I speak both. \u00a0You can't order off the brunch menu except on the weekend so we had to order something from the case. \u00a0The Spanish quiche was terrible. \u00a0It was lukewarm and cold in spots and was not heated evenly or thoroughly. \u00a0But, hey, if you like day old lukewarm quiche reconstituted in what would appear to be a microwave, this is your go to place. \u00a0Oh, and did I mention it's going to make you sick",
