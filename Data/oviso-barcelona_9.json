    "Seriously great comfortable find for brunch. This was our backup plan after seeing the wait for \"Milk\" and we're so glad we found it.The winner was definitely the exotic crepe with avocado and a nice sauce. The basic 2 egg dish isn't anything to joke about either, it's only EUR 4 and really solid.Juices/smoothies were fresh blended and tasty. The chocolate-banana crepe was perfectly done with not-too-sweet chocolate. Prices are super fair.",
