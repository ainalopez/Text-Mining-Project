    "The best lunch we had in Barcelona! Really adorable neighborhood restaurant with an 8 euro lunch menu that included a drink (wine, beer, soda)+soup of the day+an entree or 2 tapas+coffee. The red wine I had was quite nice (love that wine is as cheap as soda in Barcelona!) and the soup of the day was pea soup with mustard. A bit bland but went well with the bread we were brought. I picked mussels in a white wine sauce and a duck summer roll with spinach and spring onions as my two tapas. Both were delicious! The mussels were a tad salty but very fresh and the duck summer roll was stuffed with tender shreds of duck. The bf had the vegetarian lasagna and said it was really good. An espresso & americano at the end although I had a bit of drink envy when I saw someone else get a cappuccino.Service was all by one very friendly guy who spoke a decent amount of English. Really laid-back atmosphere and pleasant to sit outside on a warm fall day :) I only wish we'd discovered it earlier!",
