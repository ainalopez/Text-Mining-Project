    "You have the choice of either a baguette (veggie, cheese, hamburger, steak, chicken, tuna, or smoked salmon) ranging in prices 3\u20ac-3.8\u20ac., a baguette with feta cheese (4.5\u20ac) or a plate/salad with the above meat choices (4-7\u20ac). We arrived there at about 5:30 so the line was not very long... We had maybe 7 people in front of us. \u00a0The line did move quite slow though, as there were only two people prepping the food, serving the tables, and making food for us in line. \u00a0We ended up with two baguettes that totaled to be about 8,30\u20ac, then went next door to the supermarket to get a drink. Taste was decently good.. I had the smoked salmon and husband had the chicken. \u00a0Quite a decent amount of meat (and actually everything else), but we didn't think that sharing one would have been enough for us :). My salmon was a bit on the salty side, however, so I spent the rest of the night looking for something to quench my thirst.. And then some. As far as quality and quantity of food, I give it 4.5 stars. \u00a0Everything looked fresh!Service: 3. They are friendly and can communicate in English, but they need extra hands on deck!Cleanliness: 2. They cross contaminate meats and have raw meats out the veggies (probably not at the ideal temp), handled money frequently without washing hands, and picked up food and baguette with those same hands... Was a little bit off putting. Overall 3.5- for the quality and value of our meal.",
