    "I was really excited to try this place out because it was mentioned in the Rick Steve's handbook on Barcelona. I ordered the mixed paella, sangria, and the baby octopus with curry mayo sauce tapas. The sangria was yummy and so was the baby octopus dish. They were grilled with onions, laid on a bed of shoestring French fries with some type of sauce and a dollop of curry mayo. Yum! I was a bit disappointed with the paella. It had an assortment of seafood (mussels, shrimps, pork, octopus) and the rice was cooked in a very dark roux. Looked and smelled good, but almost every bite I took had sand in it. Needless to say, I was anticipating the next bite with sand and sure enough, there it was. The service was a little iffy. A friend ordered bread, and it never came. They didn't come back to check on us at all until they wanted to give us a dessert menu...but this might be a difference of cultural expectations. There was a long line to dine outside in the courtyard, but we didn't wait at all since we sat indoors. It was a bit hot and stuffy inside. Also...paella takes an extra 30 minutes to prepare, so be ready to wait.",
