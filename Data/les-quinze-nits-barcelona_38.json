    "We noticed the large line the night prior, so we thought this has to be the place to go. So the next night, we stopped in here for dinner. As soon as we sat down, I noticed several tables were waiting to get their bills or were just forgotten about. So I timed my visit at this place. 15 minutes to get seen and put our COMPLETE order in. 20 minutes later for our Sangaria, water, bread(that we got billed for and she didn't mention) and our first tapa. 45 minutes after that our meal came out and I immediately asked for our bill. She would drop the bill and 3 tables tried to pay right away with their Debit card, and she said she would be right back every time. 10-15 minutes later, she got back to those tables. People were leaving upset.Well, lets get to our long awaited meal. I had Chicken breast. ZERO flavor other then being chicken. My wife and I had to put a lot of salt on both of our meals. For what we paid and the quality of our food, I want to try and clear up the quality of this place and when you see that long line for no reason, you won't have any curiosity of what you could have missed.Looks like Lindsay B. had the same experience here dated 6/26/13. Good call!",
