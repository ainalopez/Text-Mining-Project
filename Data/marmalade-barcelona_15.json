    "Good place for brunch in Raval. Some of the best cocktails in town. Food is good, nothing special though, but the portions are big (the prices are also not on the cheap side). The atmosphere inside is super chick - something you don't normally see in Barcelona. Oh and the waiters are very nice.",
