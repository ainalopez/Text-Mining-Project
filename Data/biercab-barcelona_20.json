    "This place Has a great selection of beers from all around the world in both bottles and draft. However I have 2 issues here. This is the only place in the city ive seen serve a normal (non imperial) pint which is around 100ml smaller than a typical pint glass.Additionally nearly every pint served to my party and i had been poured extremely poorly with 7-8 cm of head. These 2 factors combined with a minimum 5\u20ac per pint price is a very poor value in my opinion.I really want to love this place but there are other places in Eixample that i can get a properly poured full-size pint.",
