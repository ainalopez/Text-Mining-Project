    "This is the perfect spot for breakfast, skillets are amazing, and as everyone else has noted, you have to try the bikini - I didn't get to try a bikini anywhere else but I am confident this one is as good as it gets!The service is friendly, the food insanely fresh and delicious. I had a fish special, with cod, fresh peas and black truffles, mind blowing.",
