    "Big burgers for the money. This place (to me) is a better deal for a filling lunch than going to a sit down restaurant. Lots of toppings and great sauces to complement a fresh grilled patty. Patatas are separate but worth it (if you can fit them). You can spend under 10\u20ac and leave more than full.This is the type of burger place I have been looking for since I got to Barcelona. Big and messy, just like back in the states!!",
