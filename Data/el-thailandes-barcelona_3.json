    "My husband is Thai so we know real Thai food. The people that work here don't speak Thai so that was our first hint that it may not be that authentic. The food here is decent. Not excellent but not bad. They use a lot of bell peppers just like Thai restaurants in San Francisco. Service was good. Good location and close to the Gaudi building.",
