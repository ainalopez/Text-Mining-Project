    "After reading the \"bad\" reviews, I completely disagree! This has become my number one suggestion of places to eat in Barcelona... After standing in line laughing at the pictures on the wall, taking glances at the visual menus of others eating while enjoying some champagne we were seated to an excellent staff that \u00a0helped to suggest the foods that would best suit our pallet. They were lively, always joking and made the guests part of the show. The calamari was perfectly cooked and not over shadowed with flavor as was all of the other dishes including steak and potatoes, cod (highly recommended), potato cake, and even the bread. It was perfect and the price was well, under any meal I would have paid for in America. CAL PEP WAS FUCKING AMAZING AND A GREAT EXPERIENCE!",
