    "We got my phone stolen when sitting at the innermost part of this restaurant. We've never imagined this could happened even in a normal restaurant.We were having dinner at 8pm there. A begger went inside the restaurant, walked around to every table and asked for money. This happened for quite a while and waiter serving pretended not seeing it!!! \u00a0Then that begger come over next to me. She kept mumbling with saliva spattering on me and put a paper with something written on it close to my face. This is very disturbing so I spoke loudly to the waiter to get her out of restaurant. The waiter had no response and action. The begger walked out of the restaurant. After a few seconds, we found our phone was stolen, which was placed on table right in front of me. I believe the incident could have been stopped by the waiter but he didn't. As we noticed, he had the door wide opened which is suspicious that he was helping those thieves. The waiter also questioned us \"is it my fault of your phone got stolen?\" That's so irresponsible and impolite. I don't think this is the first time robbery happened here. It has no CCTV which gives you zero protection and no way to catch the criminals.Food is okay but I believe the key reason of high ratings is its location next to the Barcelona theatre. It is also a perfect spot for thieves as it is close to the dangerous area la Rambla where many pickpockets happen. Tosca has big side windows which enable any thief to see everything clearly happening inside and spot any customer as targets for thief/robbery to steal any valuables.Good luck to anyone visiting Tosca. Unless you are locals in Spain which are less likely to be targets of thieves or robbers, I do not recommend anyone to eat there. If you really dare to be there, be careful with your belongings!",
