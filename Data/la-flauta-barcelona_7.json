    "Authentic AND affordable... La Flauta in L'Eixample district is just that. \u00a0You have the choice to sit inside or outside at La Flauta and if you choose to stay indoors you'll walk past an impressive display of fresh seafood on the way to your table. \u00a0We ordered several tapas dishes including patatas bravas, grilled camarones, and croquetas de pollo. \u00a0All plates came out rather quickly and were equally delicious and satisfying! \u00a0We complemented our plates with a pitcher of white cava sangria. \u00a0There's not much alcohol in it but you have to enjoy Sangria at least once while in Spain! You won't find many locals at this establishment so be sure to get there before 8PM for dinner to avoid waiting for a table.",
