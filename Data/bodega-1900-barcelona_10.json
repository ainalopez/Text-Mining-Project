    "Other than tickets bar on the opposite side, this BODEGA 1900 is one of my favourite.As referred from a Tickets Bar senior staff, we visited this best kept secret tapas restaurant,too. An egg sharp delicacy with Olive Essence , La aceituna-S Gordal c/piparra \u00a0as the first starter with seaweed rolls were unforgettable.The rest of their recommendations were all wonderful. The server also suggested El melon con vermut blanco, fresh Mellon with wine prepared, as the dessert to end this culinary journey.Frankly, they are one of the best. Thanks.",
