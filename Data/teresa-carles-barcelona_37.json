    "Amazing taste. Very fresh ingredients--with many sourced from nearby farms. We took our three boys, who loved their all-vegetarian meals despite being meat lovers. Presentation was fantastic, and the desserts were wonderful. We arrived at 7 p.m. (when it reopens for dinner) and did not have to wait in line at all. Loved the place so much we came back two more times (once for lunch, once for dinner) during our four-day stay in Barcelona.",
