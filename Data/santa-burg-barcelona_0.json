    "The Barcelona Yelpers invited me and my fiance to this place, a local but popular burger bar. We had to wait for a while but I have heard it is all worth. The staff is very friendly and they asked how I want my burger. They also asked if you like the food. That is very special in Europe so I was happy to hear that (Medium, por favor!). There was a lot of choice...dry beef, chicken, fish, veggie, pork...I decided to choose a special burger with dry beef, foie gras and apple chutney, because it sounded special for me. And it was! The burger and the foie gras was juicy and the apple chutney was fresh. It was not cheap (\u20ac10,00 for this burger) but this burger is big and you will not find this one anywhere...and if I am wrong, please send me a message;-). The beer with lemonade was also delicious.Best burger in Barcelona! Now I am craving for a Santa Deluxe..",
