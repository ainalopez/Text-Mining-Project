    "Food here was very good. \u00a0We didn't see a menu if there was one, they just brought out dishes and we ate them. \u00a0Everything was good; most of the dishes were seafood, but we had a steak entree. \u00a0The Padron peppers were the highlight, they were better here than anywhere else we had them. \u00a0Seafood was all fresh. \u00a0Food was generally saltier than I expected but I liked that.My group of 4 did not have a very long wait. \u00a0We got there at about 7:30PM on a weeknight, and there was a line to the door, but a bunch of groups at the bar left right after we arrived and we were soon at the front of the line. \u00a0Then, we asked if there was space in the back. \u00a0At first they said no, but then Mr. Pep said there was one table but that it was reserved for 9:20pm. \u00a0At this point it was only about 7:45, so we were happy to take the table under the condition that we would leave when they needed it. \u00a0It never became a problem as the dishes came out fast, and a much larger group they were obviously waiting out took much longer than us. \u00a0So, we got lucky. \u00a0I'm not sure how I would feel about the meal if I had waited an hour or more for it, but in my experience the wait was overblown.Meal came out to just over 50 euro each, with one bottle of wine. \u00a0Well worth it in my book.",
