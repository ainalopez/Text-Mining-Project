    "Oh hell yes, best meal I had in Barcelona. Came here on a Tuesday morning to have brunch and ended up having one of the better egg benedicts I've had along with a delicious freshly squeezed OJ mimosa. Waitress was super friendly and fast. Place is uniquely decorated. Lots of other American tourists in here so don't come here if you're looking for a Spanish experience, but DO come here if you want a fantastic brunch for a good deal. Also, the earlier the better - we got there around 10 and then a line formed after us. Even our timing worked out.",
