    "Let me first start off by saying that my standards for food as well as wine are set EXTREMELY HIGH. This is my first trip to Barcelona. I found out about Bar Mut by doing some research.....I was suffering from horrible jet lag so I forced myself to go out and get a bite to eat....THANK GOD! I walk in and of course they have no seats....but they made room for me as I was just one.....and I am embarrassed to admit that I don't speak spanish and was VERY grateful that my waiter did! He was AMAZING.......he modified the menu and made it possible for me to try many different things in small portions.....he started me off with scallops followed by langoustines , clams and finally sardines.....which I am NOT a fan of however had! The wine was amazing with loads of variety....you are able to purchase a bottle (they have walls of wine for sale) and take it with you. The chef was incredible and sent out a few things for me to try that I was not expecting....my experience was over the top. If you want incredible food.....excellent service and the best part it was very reasonable!!! *it is best to make a reservation as they are consistently packed. ENJOY!!!",
