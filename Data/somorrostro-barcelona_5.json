    "Wow, I wish we found this spot earlier in our stay in Barcelona (although we had fantastic food elsewhere as well). The best culinary ending. The area it is in (Barceloneta) felt like \"Spain\" to us. I wanted to explore it more, but alas, will save that for the next visit.We were a little worried they may be too busy or we'd have a wait based on the previous reviews but we got a table right away. Menus are written on big blackboards (I liked this practice throughout Europe) in English and Catalan. We tried the duck rice, goat cheese filled zucchini flowers, patatas bravas, scallops and the Iberian ham plate. Every morsel was devoured. We were blown away by everything. Favorites were the duck rice and zucchini flowers which we'd never had. Although fried, they were so light and delicious.Wine menu is great and they are helpful with making suggestions based on what you like. Service was excellent. I wanted so badly to try the plate of chocolate/bread/olive oil/salt but we literally had to run out of there when we realized the last train in Barcelona ran at midnight. Oops!They are opened every day from 1pm until midnight. You must make this a stop if you are in the city. Not far from the beach and off the over-beaten tourist path.Five Full Stars.",
