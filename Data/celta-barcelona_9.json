    "Unexpected surprise while walking around and seeing the line for Paradeta. This place became one of my favorites. Navajas (razor clams) were the cheapest and most tasty we came across. The octopus was tender and flavorful. Pimientos were charred perfectly. Pan was the crustiest and the staff was so friendly. I loved it!!",
