    "Fantastic food and drinks here. Can get very busy but lots of tables inside and out. Menu of the day is SUPER cheap and has four choices. Eaten here several times while visiting Barcelona and was always impressed. Most if not all of their food is organic and all vegan. Cool art on walls and friendly efficient staff.",
