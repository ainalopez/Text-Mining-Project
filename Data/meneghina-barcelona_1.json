    "I stayed across the walk way from this place and couldn't have been happier to. This place is a hidden gem. Great dining experience even though there was a bit of a difference of language. I had the Amazingly crispy skinned salmon with lightly caramelised apples and onions and a bit of salad it was Simply delicious.",
