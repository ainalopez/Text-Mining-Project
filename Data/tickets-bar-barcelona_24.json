    "Best birthday dinner ever. Hard to add anything to the reviews already posted, so I'll just repeat what many have already said - this is a life changing experience food-wise. You have never eaten food like this before. I will always remember this meal, and will dream of the day I can return. Favorites included the \"churros\", the tuna cone, and the \"pizza\". But it's like choosing between all of your angelic children - every single one is to die for. Don't walk. Don't run. Just take the fastest vehicle you can find to this place. And enjoy an unbelievably amazing experience. Thank you Hermanos Adrias!!!!",
