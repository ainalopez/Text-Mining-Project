    "A one of a kind experience I'll never forget. Randomly found this place because I saw a huge line in front of the place before it even opened. Everything is fresh and caught that same morning and made to order, hence the limited opening hours. The razor clams, oysters, and calamari were exceptional. The grilled rape fish was one of the best fish I've ever tried. The flavor and texture are almost inexplicable, buttery and intoxicating.",
