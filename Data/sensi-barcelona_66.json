    "Very rarely do I visit a place on vacation more than once; even more rare to visit on consecutive nights. Well I did that here, and so did the two other parties sitting next to me at the bar. Some of the best tapas in BCN. Aside from speaking English, the owner/servers will carefully explain each dish, supply recommendations, and ensure you experience here is the best possible.I stopped by here after reading reviews online from various sites and it seemed unanimous. This venue is rather small (seats 30 or so people) but is quite the intimate venue. Amazing, delicious food. The selection is not that extensive but every dish is carefully selected and well prepared. Some dishes are better than others but the patatas bravas, ceviche, and paella stood out the most. I highly recommend stopping by here. You will not be disappointed.",
