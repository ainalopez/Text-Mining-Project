    "Well what to say about Rita? For sure I'll be coming here very often. \"La Rita\" is a friendly restaurant with \u00a0very good nice Menu. For 10,30\u20ac you can 2 courses + dessert, what a bargain for this price. Th menu changed everyday during weekdays and the options are quite good. It opens at 13:00 and be sure to be the first one arriving. At around 14:00 sometimes you have to wait 30 min for a table. The portions are not substantial but the 3 dishes menu will give enough energy for the rest of the day. Highly recommend during week days.",
