    "While visiting Barcelona I cannot miss my one of my favorite cafes called Cheri. I normally stay in a hotel only 30 meters from here, Hotel Astoria. It is the perfect location for my needs. Today I started with the pan con tomate, anchovies, Jamon croquetes, potates de Cheri and English tea. The tea was for a change since I have been enjoying too many coffees.Make a stop here when you are in the barrio and you will not be disappointed.",
