    "Amazing atmosphere and food. Host seemed a bit obtuse in assigning tables. There were several tables available but he refused to give us one citing the tables as reserved. A huge turnoff at the beginning, but the quality of food compensated for this bad first impression. We tried the beef stir fry dish, and a vegie stir fry starter.Truly amazing! The wonton soup was out of this world. Quite impressive!",
