    "I met some people at the beach on my first day at Barcelona and our conversation of seafood led some locals to recommend La Paradeta. There are 3 listed but I went to the one in Born area and there was a line out the door... I knew it was legit.The place is super casual and straightforward. When you get inside, there is a table of fresh seafood display like the ones you see in the market. On the walls, there is a list of how they can be cooked (planxa, fritada, vapor). You pick what you want, they measure the quantity for you and give you your table number. You go to the cash register and order anything else (bread, water, dipping sauce, salad, what-have-you), and pay the bill. You wait until they call your table number, Enjoy.The best were the razor clams and mussels and calamari. The gambas were really good too. Actually I love them all. Wish I had more space to eat moar!",
