    "A hidden gem!! For 12.50\u20ac you get an appetizer, entree, dessert, and a drink. I had the pumpkin curry soup, the fish entree, and carrot cake. And a glass of wine :) Everything was amazing!!! Each item was full of flavor and the ingredients worked well together. I will definitely be back!",
