    "Strange mix.I've been to Mama's Caf\u00e8 two times. The first time I came here for brunch and had an extremely badly prepared not amazingly good batch of pancakes. The second time I came I ordered a lunch sandwich whichwas pretty good.The first time I came the service was polite, and the second time too.Very pretty establishment.I had a hard time deciding on the star rating. The first time warranted 2/3, because I felt like it was a rip off to call that brunch and sell it to people who eat brunch (mostly foreigners or of foreign origin), but the second time warranted 4/5, and since the 2nd time was so positive I've rated 4 stars.I'm not sure.",
