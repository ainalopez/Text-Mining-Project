    "Dear Tourists - please skip this restaurant! This has tourist trap written all over it. The fact that they have pina colada's, strawberry daiquiris and Mai Tai's on the \"Spanish\" menu should tell you all you need to know. We had much much much better food in Barcelona.We also had the seat closest to the kitchen. There is no chef, only a line cook preparing the mostly pre-made food. GF ordered the soup. We saw it come out of a boxed carton, like two buck chuck. That went into the microwave and then was served directly to us. I ordered the Iberico ham and specified mozzarella cheese. I got salami and brie instead. Didnt complain and ate only half, i had much better at other restaurants, even other touristy ones. At least the servers were all pleasant!Check my other reviews for places recommended by a local friend which were much much better.",
