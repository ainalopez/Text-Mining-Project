    "I went there after a verbal recommendation of someone. The chef\u00b4s Paella is diferent, and surprises, it is a totally different taste than what you expect from a Paella, and it is not bad at all. But due to the high scores, i expected more of it. Also portions seemed rather small...They also forgot to serve us a glass of wine we asked for.Their excellent location maybe makes them \" lazy\"",
