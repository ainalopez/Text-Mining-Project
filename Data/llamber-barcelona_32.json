    "We dined early to ensure we got in, and this proved to be a good decision. The night before at 10 pm the place was jammed, so 730 while early was so worth it. The decor is casual and comfortable. The food is outstanding. We started with the fois gras, the croquettes, the aubergne, and the cod fritters. Each dish was special in its own way and I wonder how they make something so simple taste so good (aubergne - how do they do that??). I highly recommend. Not to be missed!",
