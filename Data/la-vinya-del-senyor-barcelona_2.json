    "I'm a little disappointed with this place. It used to be so intimate with wonderful service and now the terrace has been overtaken by the restaurants around this bar. \u00a0Also, this has been the second time I've been and the staff is not very well informed on anything, what wine is seco vs semi seco. It appears as though the staff is new?? \u00a0He couldn't tell us about the olives that they carry. :( We had glasses of wine each and olives. A place for tourists, yes. A place for locals : no.",
