    "The place we tried to go to for dinner was totally full and you couldn't eat there without a reservation, so we walked a little and found Salamanca. Lots of outdoor seating, which was great as it was a comfortable evening in the summer in Barcelona. Service here was good. The paella we had was excellent. It's more than enough food for two people and there was a good amount of shellfish and the rice was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. They also make a good sangria here.",
