    "We arrived late to Barcelona and wanted to find a good place nearby. Being mostly a plant eater, I was delighted to find this little place nearby our hotel. The place is quite cosy and trendy, which is a relief considering the shabby Boheme decor of most vegetarian places. We started off with the vegetarian platter - it was good and plenty of it. For main, I went for the Gorgonzola and pear pasta while my partner chose the seitan burger. My pasta was, unfortunately, extremely sweet and resembled more dessert than a main course. The sharp and round taste of the Gorgonzola had all but vanished from the dish. My partners burger, however, was very good and juicy, most recommendable. The pasta was the main draw back why I choose to give a medium rating.",
