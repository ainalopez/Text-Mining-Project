    "I was VERY disappointed that I ordered the BEST gluten free pizza and gf Tiramisu I have ever had and one if not both of them were not gluten free. I have very bad gluten allergies and I was so sick after eating here, and I still am sick days later. I am not sure which of the two were not gluten free but I would never go back and eat there now. My server spoke very good English also so I really don't think it was an error on her part. I have a hunch the Tiramusi is what contained gluten but I don't know for sure. I am so disappointed as I read such great things about this places gluten free offerings,I never thought I would get sick eating here. If you do not have food allergies this place is worth checking out, and if you do have gluten allergies I would not risk it! I haven't been this sick in over a year as I am very good about staying away from gluten, I wish I had not eaten here.",
