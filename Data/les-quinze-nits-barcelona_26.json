    "Super convenient to our hotel, and recommended elsewhere online, so we gave it a try. Meh. The location is fabulous, but that's where the fun ends. The service was inconsistent and weird. Bread without bread plates, no cracked pepper for the olive oil and vinegar, general air of invisibility on the part of the waitstaff. The food was OK, but nothing special. I had the duck, which was a little chewy. The pasta had a hair in it. They mixed up the side dishes on the plate for two of our orders. Bizarre. Save your Euros and go to one of the 1,000 restaurants nearby.",
