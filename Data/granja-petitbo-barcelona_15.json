    "Amazing! I'm a super harsh caf\u00e9 critic, but this place has managed to be one of the best cafes I've ever been in.It is beautifully decorated, and has cool sofas lining one side while also big windows so you can look outside. There are communal tables and also more intimate tables for groups of all sizes, and a really lax atmosphere, while at the same time really classy.The waiters are really really nice in a way that I've never seen waiters be before. I was actually really surprised by how welcoming everyone was.The food. Oh my goodness. I ordered a delicious (maybe a little thin) hot chocolate and a piece of cake that was to die for. In Barcelona, I usually don't find great or good cake but here is an exception, and such a nice one. Wow, so much variety. They have delicious and interesting juices, some more lunchy options, and much more.As if it wasn't already a great place, this caf\u00e9 is in a wonderful area.Usually pretty busy in my experience, and locals go there (always a good sign) although there is a lot of tourism.Pretty manageable price wise too, I have no complaints.Looks like a great spot to study, although I'll have to try that the next time I go...Because I'm definitely coming back.",
