    "Not the first time my experience of a place has differed wildly from that of my dining companion. \u00a0But probably the first time the reasons he had a bad experience were far-reaching enough to sour my own experience.Damn good burger. Funny as hell wallpaper in the bathroom. Solid logistical set-up. Tourist friendly.Here's the thing. If you go through the trouble to create a whip-smart order & delivery system (a necessity with hundreds of customers per hour), and tons of really well thought out and well implemented signage to go along with it, best I've seen really!..... You've got to play by your own rules or the whole thing falls apart.So, when a group of pushy, loud, entitled Italians makes an art out of flouting every rule you have, when everyone else in the place is pleasantly abiding, you need to kick their perfectly-dressed butts to the curb. I know you have it in you. Pretend they're Moors.",
