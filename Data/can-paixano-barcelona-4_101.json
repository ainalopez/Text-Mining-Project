    "What's not to like about cheap and tasty bocadillos and bubbly ?!?! \u00a0This place is delicious and will only set you back a mere for 4 euros or so for any kind of meat and cheese sandwich(topped with foie gras if that's how you roll) plus a tasty little glass of cava. Ok the only setback, this place is normally packed to the brim, and they are very strict about crowding the sidewalk. You have to be assertive to get an order in and some counter space, and you are likely to get at least one glass of cava spilled on you. \u00a0However, the service is quick..and again, what's not to like about cheap and tasty bocadillos and \u00a0bubbly?!",
