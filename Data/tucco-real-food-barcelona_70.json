    "I'm glad we found this hidden gem through Yelp. It's located in a small street and we would never have found it otherwise.Hands down, the best pasta related dishes I've had at any restaurant ever. During our trip to Barcelona we went here twice but only because we discovered this treasure so late. The prices are really humble as well. We (2 people) paid 29 euros for two empanadas (starters), two main dishes, a bottle of sangria and dessert. The vegetarian lasagna was legendary. If you're visiting Barcelona this is a MUST TRY!",
