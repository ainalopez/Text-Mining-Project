    "This is a good place for some solid food at good prices if you're in the area and need to eat. \u00a0It feels like a generic casual chic restaurant with generic waiters that you can find in a big city in Anytown, Anyplace, except that you'll get a good taste of the flavors of the city.We got a tasty dinner here - patatas bravas (meh), croquetas (good), tortilla (very good), sausage (meh), paella (yum!) washed down with some beer and wine. \u00a0Service not particularly warm, and a little bit spotty, but pretty decent experience overall.",
