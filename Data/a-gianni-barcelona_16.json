    "We tried the set menus which comes with appetizer, main, dessert and drink. The sausage pasta in tomato based cream sauce was great and not too heavy. The pasta with truffle was rather plain tasting (though the most expensive with the supplement) and a bit disappointing but good experience overall topped with good tiramisu and a honeyed cheesecake which we felt was the better dessert of the two.",
