    "Love these burgers!!!!! They really know how to make burgers, the bread is good, the meat... just a problem, I don't like the fact that lately is a fashion to go in a place disposed to eat and end up working for the place... I mean... the McDonalsd / BurgerKing style, help yourself is not cool at all. I LOVE to be served at the table instead to get into the place, wait in a long line, order the food and wait again to be called to pick up your meal. It's the only objection that I have with this place. About the quality of the food... 8 points! Besides the area is nice, near the beach and Born neighbourhood.",
