    "This place was terrible. Lured in by the music, our group of five went in to have dinner. My Mocaque, described by the waiter as having a particular taste, was bone filled and tasteless. Not to mention, two of our mains arrived a full five minutes after the other three. One of our starters was also forgotten completely. My rice clumped together and seemed as if it had been microwaved, half cold and half steaming. One friend who ordered the Hake and clams, said it was okay, but nothing special. He said his rice also seemed cold. My other friend had to send his dish back as his Iberica Pork Loin was tasteless and greasy. He had to send it back, but looking on the menu opted for a Caesar salad, which was the most miserable salad I had ever seen. I don't know why the other reviews were so good. The table next to us also seemed to have big issues with their dinner. With countless good restaurants in Barcelona, I'd never come back here again. Oh, and the sangria tastes like juice.",
