    "Tourists---stay away from this place! It's pricey and they will charge you for the bread that they serve once you get seated (but you probably did not order this bread). Just a caution. If you decided to eat here anyway, you would have to verbally decline the bread if you don't want to oay for it. I only had one bite of it and it didn't taste good. Their Paella House Special was not that great for the price either. We were told it requires a minimim of 2 orders and it is more than $30 per person. This is the only restaurant that I've been to that required minimum 2 orders of 1 meal. It's ridiculous. I think they only do it to make you order 2 servings instead of one. I would suggest trying something else or going somewhere else.",
