    "After our trip to Paris and not enjoying the food there as much, the food at this place in Barcelona was much needed!! I have to say the service was very slow (compared to others we went to in Barcelona) but the food was great. \u00a0Very conveniently located since we stayed at Le Meridien across the street. The pizza was our favorite dish to order there.",
