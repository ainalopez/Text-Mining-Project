    "We had a TA Cruise starting in Barcelona. We got a head start with three days there. On one day, we were walking around the city and decided to stop in for a quick bite. I am glad we did. The place was clean and inviting, the food excellent and the service outstanding. The missus had a nice large bowl of soup, I went with a nice beef and rice. Of course we had to do the dumplings. We now know when we are in town, we will be going there. The staff were so attentive!! If you are in Barcelona and want a change of pace, walk the extra few blocks off La Rambla and check L'olla de Sichuan out!",
