    "Great little hip place about 2 blocks from Sagrada Familia. Excellent burgers (not what I'd normally order while in Spain, but you can't argue with success) and very friendly. \u00a0One complaint: was supposed to get a free shot of jaegermeister for checking in on Yelp but they said they were out and refused to provide a substitute. Don't offer a reward for checking in if you can't deliver!",
