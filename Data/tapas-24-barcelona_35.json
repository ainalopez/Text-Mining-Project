    "Solid tapas. Sit at the bar and enjoy watching your food prepared right before your eyes!The bread with tomato was the best I've had in Bar\u00e7elona. Paella was pretty good but a little on the salty side (if you like that, then this is your place). Bikini sandwich is a must-try! Truffly deliciousness!Good food, cheap drinks, awesome service.",
