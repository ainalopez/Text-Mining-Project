    "An absolutely superb meal.We had planned just to grab a main course but when we saw the menu, one of the shared starters (the cheese and bread platter with honey) sounded so delicious that we ended up trying that. It was absolutely delicious and set us up nicely for our mains: a pizza and a pasta dish.Both were cooked perfectly and tasted so good that we ended up having a second unplanned course - dessert. This, again, was sublime.The atmosphere in the restaurant was wonderfully relaxed and the wine did not disappoint. A visit to this restaurant will not be one that you regret.",
