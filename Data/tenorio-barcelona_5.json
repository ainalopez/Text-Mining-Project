    "Tenorio is where Gayle and I had our last dinner (for now) in Spain. It's nicely located on the Passeig de Gracia and right on the \"Illa de la Disc\u00f2rdia\". This place was also recommended in one of my Maribel tour \"books\". We found the \"Touristy\" factor to be low and during our evening walk through parts of this L'Eixample, there were lots of similarly classy choices. In hindsight, it was too early (8 PM) for Dinner and we were just too worn out after 2 weeks in Spain to Dine. We did like the large and comfortable space, that featured an open kitchen, decent service, and of course good wine. Gayle had Lamb and I had Catalan Sausage, of which both of us thought were just \"OK\". Maybe next time.",
