    "The reviews here are really good but I wasn't impressed with the food here whatsoever. The food seemed slapped together, lacked flavor and some of the food (the croquettes) were lukewarm. It was super packed in there which I was OK with since we met some cool folks there. Also, it didn't help that the menu and staff only speak Catalan without even a lick of English. Cava was good though. Overall, I'd pass.",
