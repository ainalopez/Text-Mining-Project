    "I had been craving Indian food even before leaving Austin.So when one of our professors (who happens to be from India) mentioned he'd treat us to an Indian meal, I pushed people over and said, \"Me!\"It was grand. \u00a0Our professor knew just what to order, encouraged us to try some Indian beers, and we sat back and ate until our spines hurt. \u00a0That's always how I know it's good eating; when my spine begins to throb.Silver bowls began to pile up as we worked our way through the menu and laughed and talked. \u00a0We loved listening to our professor order in Hindi and asked him what India was like and how he found his way to Texas State.We went back a couple times and each time was just as fun. \u00a0The service is fantastic and the prices are not too bad. \u00a0It's perfect if you're getting a bit tired of tapas, jambon, and paella...",
