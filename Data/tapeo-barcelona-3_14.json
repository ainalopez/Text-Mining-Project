    "Holy cow. These guys know what they're doing. Amazing food! Had the eggplant with honey and lime- which was amazing. The tuna special of the day which was maybe one of the best things I've ever tasted. The pork ribs with honey mustard was also amazing! And asparagus with romenesco and octopus specials were great too. All this phenomenal food- and 2 wines and 2 beers- was 61 euro. Will eat here every time I visit Barcelona for sure. Amazed (and super full).",
