    "Where to even begin with Mundial?! I've been going here for almost 20 years, since before it was refurbished. It's a classic, and deserves an urgent visit. But always at lunchtime (2pm, or just before to get a table in front) and never on a Monday. In the evening it's not worth it either. Because it's all about atmosphere and freshness. You can go for a seafood platter, or instead have several dishes of their finest shellfish such as razor clams, which are invariably perfect, their baby octopus, their very good bravas, their pa amb tom\u00e0quet and the inevitable pimientos de Padr\u00f3n. This is all about getting stuffed to the rafters with seafood and drinking small cold beers or a simple, light, refreshing Ribeiro wine. I cannot get enough of Mundial, and may it be preserved and protected for humanity's sake, for ever.",
