    "We dined here the other night after seeing the reviews on yelp and it certainly didn't disappoint. We started with the Blackberry Mojitos which were superb and shared the goats cheese croquettes which were absolutely delicious. For our mains, my partner had the lamb and I had the pumpkin lasagna. The only criticism I had was that my lasanga felt like it was lacking something as the flavour to me was a little bland. My partner absolutely loved his lamb dish though!The service was excellent. I would throughly recommend this to friends visiting Barcelona.",
