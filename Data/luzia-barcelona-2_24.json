    "The inside looks quite fancy, but the prices are actually decent and there are many families eating there. I chose the Ravioli with Mushroom Sauce and although there are only a few pieces of ravioli, it really fills you up. The mushroom sauce was extremely rich and other than mushrooms, there were also some sort of nuts or grains in the sauce. I couldn't figure it out. The filling was a cheese filling and went very well with the mushrooms. U had the Chicken with Peppers and Truffle. It was nicely presented on a wooden board with a skillet on top. She said the chicken was tender and the flavours worked well with each other. Extremely delicious she said! Last but not least, U and I shared a slice of Tiramisu. It was filled with chocolate and coffee goodness. A slight hint of alcohol and filled with cream and mascarpone cheese. So good!",
