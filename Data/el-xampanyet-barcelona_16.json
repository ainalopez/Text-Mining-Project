    "My friend who lives in Barcelona loves this place! It's her favorite restaurant and she gets special treatment because she is now a regular. The owner Juan Carlos is there and makes sure his customers are happy. Try the calamari with veggies and the steak and fried green peppers. Sounds like usual food fare but they do it soo good. Just try to order beyond what your see on their tapas display. Also their baked potatoes with chorizo. I was so glad I order tomato toast to eat up all the sauce from the calamari plate. Of course you must get a bottle of their homemade Cava which is Spanish sparking wine. The whole bottle for 9 euros!",
