    "This Basque pintxos restaurant has a lively atmosphere. \u00a0There is a large selection to choose from, but be prepared for mostly seafood dishes, though there was the typical Iberian ham, chorizo, and empanadas available. \u00a0However, they were a little slow, when we were there, to replenish these popular dishes. \u00a0In the back there is a sit down restaurant, but all the activity is around the bar and the pintxos.",
