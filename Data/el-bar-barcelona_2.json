    "Not cheap. Small portion sizes. Not extensive tapas. That said what it is offered is beautifully prepared if on the meagre side. The food is 4 stars the portion sizes 1. One scallop presented was delicious but two would have been nice for 6 euros! Meatballs and cuttlefish were superb but again too meagre for 8 euros. \u00a0Beetroot risotto splendid but tiny for 9 euros. \u00a0So come prepared to splash some cash. Nice quiet relaxed environment and the staff were very friendly and hospitable. Very helpful as we had a hungry toddler with us so they rushed out a tortilla as soon as kitchen opened at 7.30. Cannot fault the food bit think that yelp needs to up the \u20ac symbols to manage people's expectations.",
