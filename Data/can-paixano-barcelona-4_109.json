    "Dive bar indeed. The Cava was flowing, but it's OK, not great tasting. I would compare to Boone's Farm. It did the trick though. We were able to get drunk and meet some people. It was annoying that we had to buy food each time to get a glass of cava. It was very packed and at times, was hard to get service. Like a very busy club.All in all, if you are in the area, its a great place to go late night.",
