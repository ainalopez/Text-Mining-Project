    "Delicious food and a cool spot. I got the Golden Pepita with grilled foie gras and egg, which was super decadent. A favorite appetizer was the eggplant with goat cheese, really cool taste combo. It's different from the usual tapas places and a bit more expensive. The other plus for this place is that it's very lively/ loud with tons of cool looking people. I really liked it!",
