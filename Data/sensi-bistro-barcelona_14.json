    "You must get the duck confit. Honestly, that was the one dish that really stood out to me, and now I have to try my hand at making it at home. It had a tasty layer of potatoes, and was topped with a balsamic reduction that really pulled the whole thing together. I could have probably eaten three of them by myself and called it a day. That being said, the other plates we tried were also pretty tasty. The paella was too salty for my taste and the flavors were just too strong in my opinion, but my friend really enjoyed it, so I'm sure it's personal preference. As far as seafood dishes went, I preferred the calamari with garlic and parsley. The squid comes out pink and tender served on top of the riches, creamiest mashed potatoes I've ever had. It was definitely decadent, but the quality of the calamari won me over.The tapas here are not traditional, so just be aware that you will be getting dishes with a French twist. It was a nice little indulgence though from the more local, less refined tapas places. Be aware that it gets busy later at night - if you eat at American dinner time it will be fairly empty, but the restaurant fills up around 9:30/10pm. The staff is all amiable and courteous, and they really make an effort to accommodate you even when it's busy. A bonus for English speakers - they provide menus in and all speak some level of English. I struggled through as much Spanish as I could before the server had mercy on me and switched over to English.",
