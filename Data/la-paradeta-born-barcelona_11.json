    "We were searching for a place to eat for dinner and happen to find this restaurant via yelp. I really wanted some razor clams due to my first trip to Barcelona when I experience the best razor clams ever. Since this was my 2nd time to Barcelona, I wanted to make sure I got my fill of razor clams again! :)when my husband and I arrived, there was already a line of at least 20 people. We arrived right at 8 PM when they opened. My husband and I waited in line for about 30 minutes & finally got to the front where we subsequently ordered a selection of fresh seafood.Everything seemed reasonably priced and we ordered:1) Half dozen oysters2) Full kilo of clams - grilled!3) 5 packets of razor clams - marinera!4) 10 shrimps - grilled!5) One third kg of baby octopus - grilled!6) 3 bread, coke, 2 sauce containers, beerOur favorite was definitely the razor clams, grilled to perfection! If we were to come again, we would only order razor clams and make it 10 packets!! HahaEverything cost \u20ac at this restaurant including the bread and sauces! It can add up. We spent 79\u20ac here for just 2 of us.We'd Love to come back again next time we are in Barcelona!TIP: CASH ONLY",
