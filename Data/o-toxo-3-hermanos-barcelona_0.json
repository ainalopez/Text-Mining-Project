    "We found this restaurant via Yelp with quite a good rating. And what to say, it was absolutely worth to pay them a visit!! We ordered a variety of tapas, I think about 5 or 6 different types incl. fish, meat and vegetables and not to forget the tasty bottle of red house wine. The food was of good quality, the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and to our surprise the prices are very affordable!We'd go there again!",
