    "Hole in the wall joint - across from Aranea hotel. But food here is excellent. Biriyani is to die for. Perfectly cooked - not oily at all - and there seems to be some fusion of Spanish-indian-Pakistani feel to it. The owner is extremely courteous and made us feel at home. Apart from the biriyani - shwarma, escalope (cutlet), burgers, pizza - all were very very good. I'll definitely be back - despite of being 2000 miles away.",
