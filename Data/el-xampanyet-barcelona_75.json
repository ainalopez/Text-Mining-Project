    "This is a very busy tapas place in El Born. \u00a0I think I ended up walking up to the counter from the back of the bar to order from the young woman working there. \u00a0She was pretty helpful. \u00a0We ordered everything from mussels to salmon, tuna, anchovies. \u00a0Everything came out nicely presented on our plates. \u00a0It's very hectic at 2pm so there might be a little wait outside. \u00a0Everyone surrounding us seemed to be a local which was a good sign but I'm sure it's touristy too. \u00a0Be careful in this neighborhood. \u00a0The area is near the Picasso museum in the alleys but it's a popular place for the pickpocketers to hide. \u00a0Almost happend to us after we ate here and they are very sneaky. \u00a0Luckily, we didn't have anything on us.",
