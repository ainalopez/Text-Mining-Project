    "Awesome beers and fantastic food. If you guys are soup fans I definitely recommend you try the oxtail soup, one of the most delicious soups I've ever tasted. Not to mention their brewed beers are the best! Especially if you are a fan of ipa and different blends. As a fan of spicy foods I \u00a0was pleased to see they had sriracha sauce, after having looked for it around Europe for a month. A must stop bar to visit in barcelona, if I were were a local this is where you would find me on the weekends!",
