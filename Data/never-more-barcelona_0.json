    "A creatively inspiring, original, funky, labyrinthine space in the heart of the Raval neighbourhood, complete with a stuffed raven and an antique upright piano embedded into the wall overlooking the bar area. Decorated with mostly recycled objects by a celebrated Barcelona designer, formerly the window-dresser of the legendary Catalan fabric store Gratac\u00f3s, currently of the upscale home furnishings store Vin\u00e7on. Teeming with personality, Never More offers a bar, open kitchen where you can take cooking classes from its charismatic chef, Alfons, as well as private dinners and parties in a whimsical and homey setting.",
