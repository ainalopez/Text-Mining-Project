    "Excellent service, \u00a0the waiters speak English and they have separate English menus. I ordered the Spanish omelet, gazpacho, \u00a0patatas bravas, grilled calamari, tomato toast, and Sangria. Everything tasted pretty good except the calamari- tasted a little weird. The waiter even brought us shots of a sweet alcohol free of charge at the end of our dinner. Would come back here again.",
