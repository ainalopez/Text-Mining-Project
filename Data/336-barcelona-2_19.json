    "We had a 5 course, 2 person dinner for \u20ac17/person. Drinks were included (we got a huge pitcher of sangria), food was fresh and well-made, and the staff was extremely friendly. Overall, fantastic dinner location run by a local chef. Dont pass up on this place, especially if you're staying downtown!",
