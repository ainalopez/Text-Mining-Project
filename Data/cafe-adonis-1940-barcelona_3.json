    "Cheap beer, great atmosphere, great staff, and free Wifi. \u00a0My wife and I stopped here early in our Barcelona trip and the staff was great and accommodating. \u00a0Not over touristy since it was outside the center where most tourists venture. \u00a0I'll be back here some day to work and if I lived in Barcelona this place would be my backup remote office.",
