    "Maybe it's the tourist in me, but La Plata is one of the coolest stops in Barcelona. In the 3-ish days I was there on vacation, I made a stop every evening. Between the gimmick of drinking house wine out of that porron wine decanter, the fried smelt, and the lovely old timer working the bar, it was the perfect pit stop when meandering through the narrow streets of Carrer de la Merc\u00e8. I never quite perfected the wine stream drinking method and I ruined two different white shirts, but hey - it is what it is.So much fun.",
