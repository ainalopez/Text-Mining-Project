    "stumbled on this place by accident when we were visiting the Picasso museum and it ended up being one of the highlights of our trip.after a few days of eating in some mediocre restaurants in Barcelona, this place is a real treat. food and service is great! downside, the restaurant is a bit cramped with space. we arrived around 1430 and did not need a reservation for 2. did not give 5 stars as some items were a little pricey for the tapas portion size  this is one of the few places I believe is worth multiple visits.",
