    "So glad I found this place! It is a cute little place that is mostly frequently by locals and some very lucky travelers! They don't have a menu to order off of since they only have four food items: 1) boquerones which are fried anchovies - my favorite! It's not pickled like some other places before frying so you get the freshness of it 2) pan con tomate - just bread with crushed tomatos on top, beautifully simple ingredients that taste amazing for its simplicity 3) some sort of spanish sausage served with bread 4) onions tomatos and olives marinated in olive oil - again, simple ingredients that just taste good. They also give you a complimentary dessert, it's some kind of fried dough with cinnamon sugar.I think most locals come here to drink as they serve wine in these pourrars which is pretty fun to watch them drink out of, especially as they get drunker and no longer have the hand eye coordination to pour into their mouths!I prefer beer though, and the best beer to get anywhere in spain is Estrella Damm! Wish I could find that in the US!",
