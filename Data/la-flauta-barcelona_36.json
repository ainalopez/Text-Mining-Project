    "Some of the best seafood tapas in Barcelona! We went there pretty early so there was no wait, but I'm sure there's a line around 9. The waiters were friendly and there was an English menu!Our favorites were the garlic prawns and the shrimp and calamari on toast.Price was reasonable and the food was great. Would definitely recommend!",
