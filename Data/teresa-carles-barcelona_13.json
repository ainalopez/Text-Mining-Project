    "Heard a lot of buzz about Teresa Carles lately, so I decided to give it a try. I'm not a vegan or even vegetarian, but I still found the menu very appealing and everything sounded great! I had the house specialty risotto, and enjoyed it. It wasn't anything special, but still very good. The atmosphere is nice, definitely a great place for dinner with friends!",
