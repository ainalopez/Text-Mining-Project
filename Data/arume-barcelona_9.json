    "Tasty and homey place in Barcelona. In contrast to the multitudes of tapas places here, this restaurant was a nice respite with its larger dishes. Not that I don't like tapas, it's just nice to have something that is a bit more incorporated and larger. Wait staff was good and friendly, and the manager visited and chatted with us about his knowledge of our old home (Seattle). We recommend it!",
