    "This was not my first Al's experience, I've been to one of the locations in Sitges. Everything is awesome, my favorites are the pulled pork nachos and the cajun chicken salad (it really satisfied my craving for American style big salads!). The service is friendly and attentive. The best part is everything is homemade, the chips, the hamburger patties and even the buns! The desserts are not always same each visit which is nice. I love this place, it satisfies my craving when I miss home.",
