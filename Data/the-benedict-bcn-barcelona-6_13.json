    "This place is to be avoided at least in the night.I now realize it is prime target for north-african gangs of wallet and phone thieves.The reason why I blame the venue is that they \"waste\" two bartenders at the door with the sole purpose of constantly droning over how we as customers cannot stay even one millimeter outside the door with a glass or a beer. But they sure let a three-man gang go in, literally pat everyone till the end of the bar and back and let them out.With me one of them stomp my foot and stood there at a standoff, raising the tension. He knew I would have looked at him, cos I'm big and I don't start a fight for something like that. His friends bumped and took my iPhone.The fault is primarily mine I know. But this place let one bartender behind the bar and two doing nothing useful outside?As a night bar avoid this venue...",
