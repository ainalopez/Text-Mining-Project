    "Fantastic eating experience. Great service as well. The night we were there (wednesday) you couldn't get a table but there is seating at the front in the bar area which worked out great. The grilled squid with pumpkin puree was the best of the dishes we tried though we left with me complaints. Definitely worth checking out!",
