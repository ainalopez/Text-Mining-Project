    "The best meal I've had in Barcelona --\u00a0beautiful space (away from the tourist crowds, too, for an extra bonus), incredible food, warm service. We had the 3-course market menu for dinner and it was just exquisite --\u00a0fresh, simple food at its best and most elegant. Will absolutely come back next time (and every time) I'm in town!",
