    "Fun, but tiny, spot that serves an awesome made to order sangria. Not sure if there is AC here, but it was blistery when we went. Really nice owners and it looked like 3 people did all the cooking and serving here. The guy behind the bar/kitchen had a great rhythm to everything he did, especially when making our sangria. In California we were used to pre-made batches of sangria, so seeing it made to order was a treat. To make a long review short, that sangria disappeared way to fast and was way too easy to drink.",
