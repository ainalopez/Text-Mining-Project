    "So glad we were able to find some decent sushi in Barcelona! Temaki-ya obviously specializes in temaki and they certainly don't skimp on the filling. It's kinda like a hand roll, but on crack. We enjoyed four different kinds with mostly salmon as the filling and to be honest, they all kind of tasted the same. However, all were delicious tasting! Using the check-in offer, we got 50% off of the hot roll. (Thanks, Yelp!) One nitpick was that I think the bottle that has soy sauce and wasabi mixed together was very unappealing looking as well as downright sacrilegious. Even though they're not supposed to be mixed together to begin with, if one chooses to mix, it should be done according to his/her own taste preferences!Anyway, I definitely recommend this cute sushi place and would return. :)",
