    "tripadvisor.com/Restaura\u2026best place in barcelona! i'm just going to copy this review from tripadvisor: \"Muy bueno, comida y bebida a MUY buen precio pero hay que saber los truquillos\" Reviewed April 5, 2012 I love to go in Xampa\u00f1eria, a great place for drinking and eating for a low price.Buuut, you need to know the trick, or you are not going to be able to eat or drink anything..1)Go straight to the end of the bar.. 2)The person who order the food need to be always the same and order always to the a specific bar atender. And you pay just in the end.3)You need to eat for drink! I mean, they don't sell just the cava, you need to order some food as well...4)Try the \"cava rosada\" and the \"plato combinado de salsishas\" is super awesome!Positive points= Quality of the food, price (very cheap), atmosphereNegative points= Always VERY crowded, and you need to know the tricks to order the food. Close at 10:30pm and on sundays. Best time to go is on afternoon and on weekdays.",
