    "This place is a hotspot for brunch, very busy! I came on a Sunday around 12:30pm and there was an hour wait. However, it was worth the wait! I ordered a chai latte and fresh squeezed orange juice. They were wonderful! The ricotta pancake with fruit and maple syrup was incredible! Also, the scrambled eggs with ham and on toast was great. The food always comes out with beautiful designs. If you can withstand the wait, I highly recommend coming here!",
