    "The pealla was really good.. We ordered paella negra and a red paella with seafood. The only catch is - the paella is about 17\u20ac per person with minimum of two person order. One 2 person paella is probably good for 4 i would say, we ordered two orders of a 2 person paella and it was more than enough. I wouldve given it 5 stars but it was a bit expensive.",
