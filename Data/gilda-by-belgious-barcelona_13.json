    "Great find. Great food. Great drinks. Amazing stuff. The owner really puts his heart and soul into this tapas bar because it shows. I highly recommend ordering what the staff there likes. We did that and they were on point with their suggestions. Going to Gilda was such a great experience for a foodie or for someone who wants to experience Barcelona like a local. ..we will be heading back again. Order the ceviche and potatoes bravas.",
