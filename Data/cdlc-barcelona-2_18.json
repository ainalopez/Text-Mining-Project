    "Incredible food presentations, and the scallops were perfect. \u00a0The atmosphere is extremely loud (even on the Tuesday night we visited.) My date and I chuckled about yelling to each other over our swanky dinner. The lychee martini was the best I've ever had. We shared the Osaka appetizer, which was a selection of Asian tapas, including mouth-watering scallops, veal dumplings/potstickers, and grilled chicken skewers, all with two yummy dipping sauces. We shared 6 oysters, which were fine, but I would not order them again. We ended the meal by sharing the \"Delicious\" dessert, which was a beautifully arranged assortment of fresh fruits with melted chocolate and whipped cream dips. Essentially, this was fruit fondue for 12 euros/pp. We didn't have room in our stomachs to order an entree, which was fine because with a tip we spent 130 euros. *Tip- Dress nicely and make sure you have a reservation!",
