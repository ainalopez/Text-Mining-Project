    "Best food and atmosphere in Barcelona. \u00a0The guys who work there (Sebastian and Brandon) are super cool and authentically hospitable. \u00a0Yuri (sp?), the owner, also has Sensi Tapas nearby. \u00a0We had a few tapas dishes that were to die for - veggies in a warm tomato sauce, pork, paella and clams in some creamy white sauce. \u00a0Highly recommend this place!",
