    "I finally found the best tasting food in Barcelona. Food in Barcelona is generally good everywhere, but this place is excellent. we discovered it by chance when walking in the Gothic Quarter just off La Rambla. \u00a0I had Kir Royal for a drink which was excellent. We had several tapas and each was to die for. We also had gespacho soup - excellent and. Ceviche \u00a0from the cold starters menu - was very fresh and full of flavors, came with some little crispy chips which were delicious. Tapas we tried: fried calamari, marinated olives, \u00a0grilled octopus, baked asparagus with almonds , risotto with ham and wild mushrooms. Excellent. All made from fresh ingredients and full of flavors. Instead of desert i ordered baked camembert with cameralized \u00a0onions and balsamic vinegar souse - it has sweet taste. The bill for two came to 60 euro, including 2 euro tip ( to round up the bill) for: two glasses of red house wine, one cocktail, 6 tapas, one cold starter and two soups. Would love to go back.",
