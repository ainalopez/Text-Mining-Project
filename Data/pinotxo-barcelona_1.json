    "We stopped by for lunch ad a could and the food was excellent. I don't think it's the best tapas in town, as some guidebooks suggest, but the staff were very friendly and the food was still very good. Expext to pay about \u20ac50 for lunch with a couple of glasses of cava for two people. There aren't many seats, so expect a bit of a wait during busy times. The pork with chickpeas was our favourite of the dishes.",
