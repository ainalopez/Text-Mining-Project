    "Wow!!!! Loved, loved, loved this place! I read reviews which lead me to make reservations in advance for a group of 6. The service was OUTSTANDING and the food was as good. We did the chef choice menu since we had a group and it was perfect. Being from Chicago we know good food and this place was by far the best we had in Spain all week. We even went back out last night because we loved it so much! Go here, you will love it!",
