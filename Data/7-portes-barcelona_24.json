    "Really enjoyed this place. I made an online reservation about a month in advanced and was seated right away at a nice table outside (we watched lots of people waiting for tables so come before 8p or be prepared to wait) we had a lovely cava sangria, green salad and grilled fish platter for 2 people. The food was fresh, the service was very attentive and price was right at 79 U.S. Dollars. Also by the port so we had a nice walk after dinner.",
