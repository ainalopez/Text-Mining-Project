    "This place is all about the experience. You walk in, everybody is standing somewhere with some kind of food in their hand, keeping an eye on their glasses of cava that they have set on the counter, eating and simply enjoying life. Can Paixano has a great vibe. You go in, find a spot, get your drinks, and order food as you please. Prices are cheap and the food is delicious. Fast service too. I think it is a perfect lunch spot. It's a must when in Barcelona. It is packed with tourists, but who cares; just bunch of people there to eat good food, and drink Can Paixano's cava...",
