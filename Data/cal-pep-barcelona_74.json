    "Being vegetarian, I thought it would be hard to find tapas that I could eat. When my husband suggested going to Spain for vacation, I prepared myself to be hungry for the duration of your trip.We went to Cal Pep the first night in Barcelona and let me tell you, this place is AMAZING!!!!! There was a long line but definitely worth the wait! We got lucky and were seated in the back room because someone cancelled their reservations (there are only a few tables and reservations are required back there). Service was fantastic! They recommend dishes for you based on your dietary requirements and likes/dislikes. The food was so good. I have a new found love for tapas! It's been a month since we ate at Cal Pep and I still dream about this place!Our waiter suggested the following items for me, all of which I could eat over and over:Spinach with garbanzoGarlic mushroomsFried artichokeGrilled PeppersMy husband also loved his dishes which included:CalamariMusselsJamon",
