    "Mama's was the first place I saw multiple people on their computers in a cafe, just working. \u00a0We had the all-day breakfast for lunch out on the back patio, which was very enjoyable.The food was fairly simple American. \u00a0My friend had the pancakes and thought they were good. \u00a0I got the beef and scrambled eggs, which was hearty and delicious.Their hours are also fantastic for Barcelona, open 10am-11pm on Sunday.",
