    "Owned by the same wonderful folks at Cera 23, Arume, like its older sister is somewhat difficult to find. It well worth the search. \u00a0Again, outstanding service and food in a really fun location. \u00a0Wonderfully inexpensive for a quality and service and again, those blackberry mojitos were a delight. \u00a0We ordered the well reviewed paella as our mains and assorted appetizers to begin and loved everything. \u00a0What really makes this restaurant one step above is the outstanding service. \u00a0We even ended up talking with one of the partners (Andrew?) and he was as delightful as his staff. \u00a0Be sure to make reservations as here again, the place is packed but never feeling overcrowded. \u00a0A not to be missed dining experience and I don't believe we broke 60E for,the both of us.",
