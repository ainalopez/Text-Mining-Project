    "Came back on my last day in Barca and I'm glad I chose here for my final cappuccino! It was wonderful and the presentation was lovely (mmm, cinnamon stick). I got a slice of carrot cake to go and as I was about to put it in the fridge I abandoned all self-control and just about inhaled half of the cake. I can say, without a doubt, that this was the Best Carrot Cake I Have Ever Had. Carrot cake is my dad's favorite cake so I've been eating it quite a lot during my nineteen years on this planet. This cake is moist, the icing creamy and not overpoweringly sweet, and the layers make it difficult to fit one bite on your average fork. The carrot bits are neither too chunky nor nonexistent, and the harmony of cake part and icing part is melt-in-your-mouth bliss. Heaven can be bought, people, and it's yours for \u20ac3,50 at this fantastic caf\u00e9!!!",
