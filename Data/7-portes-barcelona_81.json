    "We heard mixed reviews about this place but enough people gave it high marks so we gave it a try. Really great looking restaurant, great atmosphere, supposedly one of the oldest establishments in Barcelona. After a 45 minute wait, we were seated. We ordered the seafood appetizer and it was the perfect way to start the meal. Nice selection of regional seafood bites, mussels, shrimp, sea snails, anchovies, etc.I was there for paella and I was not disappointed. Nice presentation in their blackened pans, everyone around us was eating paella. Perfect textured rice, great flavor but perhaps a bit light on the shellfish. I loved it, but my wife and our friends were not as impressed. Perhaps this regional style did not meet their expectations. This visit to Spain got me drinking priorat wines. We enjoyed a really nice bottle with our meals at a very reasonable price.",
