    "I live in New York City and Montiel is one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. I came here alone and had the tasting menu with wine pairing. The food and service were impeccable. I found this restaurant on yelp and understand why everyone gave it 5 stars. If I could give it 6 stars, hands down I would. I was so impressed with each dish and the way it was presented by the wait staff as well as on the plate.",
