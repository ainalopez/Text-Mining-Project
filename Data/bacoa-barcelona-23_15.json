    "The burgers here are pretty much phenomenal. \u00a0Not a lot else to say. The meat is clearly recently ground and cooked well (seared crispy with red inside, thin patties). All the accoutrements and house sauces are fantastic as well. Even the rustic potatoes, which are tough to make as crispy as they do. And you can't beat the price for Born/Gothic",
