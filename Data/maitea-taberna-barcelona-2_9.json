    "Fantastic little cafe with both hot & cold tapas. \u00a0Cold tapas are self service from the case along the long counter. \u00a0It's absolutely empty at 8 pm, but by 9:30 it's packed. \u00a0There a lots of other cafes in the area, but they were all dead while this one was hopping and for good reason. \u00a0You can have a simple meal as fast or slow as you wish. \u00a0Great place to have drinks, beer or homemade sangria, custom mixed fresh each pitcher. \u00a0Popular locals gathering spot.Food is fantastic and varied from simple/safe to the more challenging for the adventurous. \u00a0The staff is very accommodating and happy to explain all the dishes. \u00a0This has to be one of the least expensive meals in BCN, yet has incredible quality. \u00a0Definitely a must-do when visiting Barcelona. \u00a0Lots of families with kids go early.",
