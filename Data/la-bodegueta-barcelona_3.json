    "This is a place that I really enjoyed having dinner while in Barcelona. Near to la Rambla but not as touristy as most other places. The service is 100% Catalan and the dishes are really good - the Jamon Serrano and Cecina were delicious. This is a place I recommend to anyone who is in the neighborhood.Gracias!",
