    "Having dined at two traditional sea food restaurants before my third night this was a welcome change as lower key and more tapas focused. Not sure what all the hype is with tickets (tried to get an online reservation when they opened 60 days ago and day of) we went to this smaller version directly across the street from tickets. I loved it. Dinner for two was about 80 U.S. Bucks. Wasn't going to try the house vermouth and did and highly recommend it! Tasted the olives, grilled octopus. Ham pate, the sandwich special, salmon tapa, tomatoes and eggplant. Along with a glass of wine for each of us and we were stuffed! Would suggest you try it!",
