    "First of all, I want to thank you (the owner, I hope you are reading it!) for feeding me one of the best meals in my life. I was on a solo trip throughout Europe and had obvious difficulties finding vegetarian food everywhere but this place was like sunshine on a cloudy day.First and foremost-Cheap food-9 Euros is as good as it gets.AND IT IS 4 COURSES! After a short wait the owner seated me upstairs and it has great ambience.I was helped by a server/waitress who understood my obvious difficulties communicating in Spanish(hint: I dont speak any Spanish) . She was very nice and patient with me and this was a welcome experience compared to the other cities that I have visited in Europe. The food is incredible and I still remember the flavors! They use a simple handwritten menu which is a very different experienceTipping is a social norm(requirement) in the US which is where I live, but the server here totally deserves my tip.I might have committed a faux pas by leaving my tip on the thing they give you to keep your credit card in. I apologize if this is considered a very rude thing but this gesture was never done with wrong intentionsI highly recommend everyone, vegetarian or otherwise, to visit this place. Additionally, if i ever vist the great city of Barcelona again (which I hope to), you will see me here",
