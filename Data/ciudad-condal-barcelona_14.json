    "One of my favorite tapas restaurants, if not my favorite choice for tapas I had in Barcelona. This restaurant was recommended by our driver and my husband, friends and I enjoyed it greatly! Such a variety of tapas, unique flavors, cute presentation, great/2 story space and wonderful customer service at this restaurant. The shrimp skewers are absolutely delicious and was the favorite among my group of 6. We actually came to this restaurant 3x within 4 days!",
