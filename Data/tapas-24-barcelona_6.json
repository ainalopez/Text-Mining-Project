    "Asian female server has a terrible attitude, system for seating is disorganized, and food is overpriced.When I asked if the line I was asked to wait in was also for seating outside, she literally yelled at me to just wait in line.There is no sign-in, there is no system, and people who had been waiting longer were out-bullied for tables by people who took more initiative.Go and enjoy El Nacional instead.Eff this place. \u00a0It almost ruined a perfect honeymoon had we not got up and left.",
