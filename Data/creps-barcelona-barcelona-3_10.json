    "Visited here in March 2010. I was in Barcelona for 6-7 days and came here two or three times after the first taste. It's a perfectly-situated snack spot since you can visit it on the way out or on the way back to your ho(s)tel. The crepe dough was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. All fruit and chocolate tasted very fresh. Overall a very tasty crepe that's not too sweet and certainly not bland at all with a large menu to choose from. Friendly staff too.",
