    "A strong 3.5, but not quite a 4.Service- 5/5 excellent for being kind and polite. Atmosphere- 5/5 really nice! They want to emphasize a quality meal that doesn't cost horribly much.Food- some things done really well, some aren't as well. We did the prix fixe menu, which had plenty of variety. - bread with garlic and tomato- 5/5! - Mushroom croquettes- 3/5 the barbecue sauce with a mushroom croquette is honestly pretty strange!- shrimp starter- 3/5 the portion is crazy large!! Served sizzling in front of you. My biggest beef (or shrimp?) is that they don't devein the shrimp at all, which is a hardcore rookie mistake of any nice restaurant! You're trying to eat shrimp while picking the poop out of them, and they end up overlooking quickly if you're not careful also.- lamb- 3.5/5 juicy and really fatty. Served with sides that were in a lot of oil. - steak- if you order medium rare, it will probably come out raw. Three other tables ordered hot stones for the meat to be cooked on again. Other than that, taste was nice. - Catalan cream- 3/5 it's an egg custard tart. It was okay, just not particularly good.This place is really nice and was a nice find, but a some of the dishes just had something strange or wrong about them. In general a very nice dinner for the price, and I'd give it a second shot.",
