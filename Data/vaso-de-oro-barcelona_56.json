    "From the street it is unassuming, we walked right past before checking the street number and doubling back. Inside is a different story: it's loud and crowded. But once you have fought for some elbow room at the bar the food is great and the service snappy. Contrary to some reports there are menus, in Spanish and English (though some of the translations are wacky - \"snuff\" or \"spawns\" anyone?). \u00a0A great experience!",
