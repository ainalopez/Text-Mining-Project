    "Thank you yelp for coming to the rescue in Barca! It was the last day of our 10 day vacation in Spain, and we just had way too much tapas and not enough veggies. We were able to yelp this place close to our apartment and decided that a cheap and absolutely delicious sandwich was the perfect way to wrap up our vacation. Boy, we were not disappointed! For 7.3 euros, we got 2 sandwiches - chicken and beef. The huge chicken chunks were moist and flavorful. The beef wasn't tough. Loved the sauces they generously apply. But best of all were the veggies packed and stuffed into the sandwich. Oh veggies! How I have missed you!!The place gets crowded as it only has 4,5 tables. Get take away and eat along the marina.",
