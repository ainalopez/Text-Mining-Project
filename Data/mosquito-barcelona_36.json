    "Really enjoyed this Asian Fusion restaurant! My husband and I had lunch here on the way to the Picasso Museum and beat the lunch crowd as we were seated right away at the bar before the place started to get packed. As we saw down we looked at the menu, it is in Spainish and Chinese, you just have to figure it out. They started a waiting list and once we were just starting to get our food there were 17 parties already on the waiting list 30 minutes after we arrived.We ordered the:Duck- AMAZING! they smoke it, then steam it, then fry it up! Then you dip it in a gravy sauce that was yummy delicious!Pho Camp- \"Country\" pho. Very good flavor, it was rice noodles with beef, and they give you a side dish of bean sprouts, mint leaves, and lemons that you add into your soup! Very flavorful!Side of Bok Choy stir fried- Very crunchy and fresh2 orders of Pork wontons!- SOOO good we devoured them all!The only negative thing about this restaurant is that there was only ONE girl server running the restaurant while the mom and son were cooking in the kitchen. The wontons and dumplings are MADE TO ORDER! When you order your food, they roll it up and cook it then so it may take a little bit of time for your food to come out. Expect to wait, we were there for at least 2 hours but the food was definitely excellent!We ordered a water and 2 beers. They have a wide selection of different types of beers here. Our bill came out to be 34euros.",
