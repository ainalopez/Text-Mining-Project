    "My friends and I went here for our last dinner in Barcelona. We heard good reviews so thought we would try it out. Sadly, it didn't live up to those good reviews. The food was okay but the service was terrible!! We had a group of 9 (so yes we were big) but it felt like we were being ignored the entire time! We got seated and no waiters came to our table for a good 15min..they would go to other tables frequently and we would try to wave them down but no one came!! When they finally came over, we were ready to order \u00a0but only took our drink orders and went away.Because of this it took over 45min-1hr to get our food. The only good thing about this place is that the food portions are large and it's affordable. The reviews said they have the best paella in town but I didn't think so...I had better ones! If you want cheap and a lot of food, you should come here..but it also comes with a side of TERRIBLE SERVICE!!",
