    "The dish was really good, cocktails too! Waiters were really nice. Service was fast and the room is beautiful. Perfect for a girl dinner or romantic dinner. I recommend this place, not too expensive, around 30\u20ac plate + dessert and 2 cocktails. You can eat many differents things, tapas, fajitas, risotto.. Such as a great place!",
