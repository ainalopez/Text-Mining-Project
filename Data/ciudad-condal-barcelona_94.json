    "Best place we went to in Barcelona while on our honeymoon. Excellent service, fresh awesome food, friendly waiters. Whatever you do, don't go out without eating and don't get scared looking at the crowd. One tip if you are a first time visitor, you have to give your name to the maitre d' to get a seat. As per classic european style, there is no line, you have to plough through the crowd.",
