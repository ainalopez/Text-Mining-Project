    "Great handmade pasta and bread in a cozy restaurant where the proprietor is constantly checking in to make sure you're having a good experience. I had a lovely tagliagtelle with mushrooms and my fiance had an amazing orchiette which was perfectly al dente. \u00a0Prices were very fair. \u00a0Would go again.",
