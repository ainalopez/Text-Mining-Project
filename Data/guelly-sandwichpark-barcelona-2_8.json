    "Such an amazing place! We stopped by before entering Park Guell for a drink and loved Tony and his family so much we had to trek back through the park to have lunch there! \u00a0The food was delicious, the friendly nature inviting and you have to write on the inspiration wall! \u00a0They also have picnic lunches you can take with you for the park! \u00a0The perfect day trip when you are in Barcelona!",
