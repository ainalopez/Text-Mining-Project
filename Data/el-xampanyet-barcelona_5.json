    "It's in a busy area, literally few stores over from the Picasso museum. \u00a0Being hungry, having finished a 1.5 hour tour of the Picasso museum, and with a full plate of to do things on the site seeing list, El Xamplet seemed like a right choice at the time. It was not an experience of food gone wrong dish after dish. \u00a0Some items worked well such as the house cava and the grilled calimari (the last item come out and saved the meal). \u00a0Items that were bad, include: (1) grilled beef and fried peppers, what's worse than a terrible cut of beef, is the terrible cut of beef over cooked and over seasoned; (2) sardines in oil - over salted, and a tad too \"fishy\" for my preference- think of those unfortunate times where the salmon oil tablet burst or the after taste of taking the fish oil tablet; (3) mixed seafood - I should have waited to go to Quimet and Quimet from what I've read, this was bland, and not my cup of tea.",
