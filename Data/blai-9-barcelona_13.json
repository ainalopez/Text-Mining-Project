    "Do not understand why this magnificent place have not received yet hundred 5* reviews. It is extremely good!The Carrer Blai has a lot of cool pintxos places, even the famous Quimet y Quimet is in the neighbourhood, but Blai 9 overcomes all the expectations.We have been there 3 times in our short 5 days trip and would like to come back there again and again.The staff is super friendly, interior is well designed, food is creative and tasty. All pinxtos on white plates costs 1 euro, on a black - 1,5 euro. A glass of wine - 1,5 euro, a bit less for beer as well. The cool detail about this food-bar is that pintxos here are not on the baguette bread, but on small tasty pancakes. All pintxos are very creative and real piece of art, and a real festival of tastes in the mouth.The whole atmosphere is very warm and just right, strongly recommend to everyone!",
