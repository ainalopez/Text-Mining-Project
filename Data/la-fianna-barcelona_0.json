    "The ambience is dark and borderline burlesque, mostly because there's a part of the bar that has elevated beds. \u00a0I'm not here to review the sexy time I went on a date at this dimly-lit bar in Barcelona (I'm sure you're thinking, \"Which one?\"), but instead, all the times I went here with my girlfriends to get the best strawberry mojitos in town. The food was fine, nothing impressive in particular. The service--on less busy nights--was commendable and 'friendly' (loose term in Espa\u00f1a). There is plenty of space, but also plenty of people--so come early.But like I said before: Strawberry mojitos! They're 7-8 euros a pop, but my friends and I came here so often that we stopped getting lost in el Born (miracles do happen).",
