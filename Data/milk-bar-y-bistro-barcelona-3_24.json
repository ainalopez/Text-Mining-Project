    "EVERY item that came out of this kitchen looks amazing!!! We ordered their eggs florentine and salmon benedict...and, I had their bloody mary. Soooo yummy! My stomach is super happy right now. \u00a0I would give them a 5 stars, but their bar staff was not friendly! \u00a0Our waitress was awesome though.",
