    "This is for me, the best italian restaurant in Barcelona.The pizzas are great, but everything I've tried so far is amazingly good. The ingredients are super fresh, and include some italian classics like burrata or bresaola, that I really can't find anywhere else.You tend to overeat and feel stuffed afterwards, because everything looks so good that you order more than you can eat.",
