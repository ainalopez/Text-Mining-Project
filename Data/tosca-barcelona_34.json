    "What a great find! Just wandering through the Gothic Quarter and we emerged right at the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana. This was our first delightful surprise. The second was turning around and finding Tosca right there across the street. If you like Mojitos, theirs are especially good, large, and only 5 Euros. And the food was delicious. We had the salmon with bok choy, goat cheese and caramelized onion empanada, calamari friti, and a selection of gelato (lemon with raspberry sauce and dulce de leche with chocolate sauce). Prices were a bit high, but realistic for such a touristy area, and staff was friendly and spoke English. My only complaint (and the reason for losing one star) was that after taking our order our waitress disappeared completely. From then on the food runners brought our meal, but no one stopped to ask how everything was or if we wanted more drinks (which we did.) I finally flagged down one of the other waiters to get that delicious Mojito, but by then we were almost finished eating and we wanted to be on our way, so we left without indulging in any more. But, I can still recommend it for the food and location.",
