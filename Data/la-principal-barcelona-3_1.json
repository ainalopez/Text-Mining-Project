    "It is a pity that yelp doesn't allow to give 4 and a half stars, because this deserves a 4,5. Located in Sant Antoni, but really really close to the eixample and the raval, in Goya's square, I remember this place from my beginning in Barcelona, and that was 20 years ago. They have remodelled, but in a really good way, still have the vibe from an old place, the place were our grandfather went to play cards or domino with their friends meanwhile fixing the world. It is a really nice place to have a drink chatting with an old pal, because the music is not too loud and the light is bright enough to see faces. Service is fast and the prices are really good. I didn't have the chance to taste any of their tapas but the bravas looks really nice. They also have vermut combos, olives plus vermouth, chips plus vermouth and more, not too expensive. I will be back for sure.",
