    "Three and a half stars. If you have been backpacking across Europe for months, eating nothing but granola bars and Egg McMuffins, this place will seem like foodie paradise.I had the \"surprise\" menu. The only real surprise was a chilled shot of soup made from the water inside of a tomato. Everything else was fairly standard. The first dish was the best... A shrimp paella plate. Beyond that, I had a tuna steak that was overcooked, a rice dish with a mushroom sauce that could have come from a box, a sour lemon sorbet, and a pretty basic flour less chocolate cake.When I heard \"surprise menu\", I guess I expected some really exotic concoctions. I also hoped that there would be some actual Catalan speaking Barcelona residents eating here. Nope, all Americans, Canadians and Brits. Easy to tell because the place is very small (room for about 20).The setting is intimate and the service is reasonably good. They also do a good job with the wine pairing. Of 5 wines, at least three were exceptional.For about 100 Euros per person with wine, Con Gracia is simply not all that surprising or valuable.",
