    "Stopped in around 1pm for lunch without a reservation (although they asked), and the restaurant was pretty empty (although it filled up while I was eating for typical Barcelona meal times). \u00a0I think I was the only American in the restaurant, but they did have an English menu, which I read with the Spanish one side-by-side. \u00a0The daily special menu was only in Spanish and Catalan - I opted for that (maybe not advised if you're not used the cuisine, it was not at all what I expected). \u00a0I started with a lukewarm mushroom out, with ham. \u00a0The soup base was great, but I would have preferred it warmer. \u00a0Next, I had a albacore tuna steak with ribbon-ed carrots and cucumber. \u00a0The waiter said it was lightly seared, but I couldn't see a sear on the meat at all. \u00a0I didn't like it. \u00a0Last for dessert, red wine flavored italian ice over oranges and cream. \u00a0Nothing was what I expected, but maybe I should have ordered from the regular menu or asked for a more detailed description of the food? \u00a0Nice restaurant, but probably won't go back, although they did have cute (custom) bread plates...",
