    "We were roaming the area looking for a guidebook suggested place that was actually not there when we stumbled upon Cal Chusco & I'm so happy we did! The food was inexpensive, cooked in the tiniest of kitchens by the friendliest of staff, including the hard-working owner. We were probably 1 of 2 tables that were English-speaking, which was amazing after the touristic feel of Barcelona as a whole. for 12 euro we had a sizzling plate of gambas planchas with salted and cilantroed olive oil so tasty, we literally licked the plate clean. We also had a couple other tapas, a couple beers & a very worthwhile check for our afternoon feast. I'd recommend this to any traveler who loves finding a tiny gem off the beaten path.",
