    "This place deserves every single star. We were visiting Barcelona and after one too many tapas, decided to try Italian at Brunaqui, which happened to be close to our hotel. After our first visit, we just kept coming back everyday for lunch (unfortunately they are closed for dinner). This is a small family run restaurant and their menu changes daily. We tried the spaghetti in tomato sauce with ricotta, the cous cous with vegetables, their pasta and a couple of other dishes over the course of a few days and every single dish was outstanding.They were attentive to the fact that our 11month old was also scarfing down the food and made suggestions and altered it to be suitable for him too. I cannot say enough nice things about the food and the people who run this place.I'd have loved to say 'we'll be back' but unfortunately, we're bout 8000 miles away.Thank you, you guys. You saved us a lot more trouble than just hunting for a place to lunch.",
