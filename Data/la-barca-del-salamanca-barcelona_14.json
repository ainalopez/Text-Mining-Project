    "There are no menu provided to us, the waiter lead us directly to the fresh seafood, and not tell us the price of the seafood. Also the offer desert without asking us and it comes to the bill. We are 3 people ordered little seafood with a paella, finally it comes to over 300 Euro!!! Another thing wired because the vote on Yelp under this restaurant either 1 star or 5 star...I believe only the 1 stars are real comments.",
