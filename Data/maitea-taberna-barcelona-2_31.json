    "I came in here around 9:00 on a week night in the summer, and luckily ended up beating the dinner rush. Within 10 minutes of securing a seat at the bar, the place was completely packed.The deal at Maitea is that you serve yourself from the various trays of pintxos on the bar (or grab a fresh hot one when the bartenders come around), and at the end you pay based on the number of toothpicks on your plate. This place is a great value for money as I left super full and I think I only spent \u20ac20 for two people including a bunch of drinks.Particular favorites were the two hot sausage pintxos that came out fresh. One was blood, not sure about the other, but it was topped with a melted cheese that was absolutely delicious.Fair warning: there are some items here that are not that great (a bunch of the fish ones, \u00a0much to my surprise), and there is a strong urge when you are in here to just take whatever is put in front of you. If I ever end up back here on a future trip to Barcelona, I know to limit some of my selections so that I can enjoy more of the quality items.",
