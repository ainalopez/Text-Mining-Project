    "Wow, I loved Barcelona and the food they make!! Quimet Quimet was recommended to me by a friend and the hotel I was staying at (5 minutes away at the foot of Montjuic) so after seeing the Yelp pictures and hearing that Ferran Adria stops by for a bite sometimes, I had to check it out. It's a small restaurant on a quieter street off a larger street with several tapas restaurants so make sure to note the exact location. To provide some imagery, the whole restaurant is probably half to 2/3 of the size of my NYC bedroom. Wine and spirits line the walls but a few chefs nimbly put together plates to serve to those at the bar and a few small tables.If possible, get a spot by the bar right in front of the chefs! It is SO much easier to order and a lot of fun to watch them get orders ready. It'll also give you an idea or what you want to try next. We came soon after the restaurant reopened for dinner and it was already packed. Our favorites were the salmon, yogurt, honey (got 3 of these), shrimp with red pepper, and pate with mushroom. Each one was about 2.5 euros. Great place to stop for a bite before a late dinner or to sample the many tastes Quimet Quimet has put together.",
