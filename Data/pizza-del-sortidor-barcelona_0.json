    "Let me start by saying I'm a New Yorker so I know good pizza. Pizza el sortidor serves magnificent pizza... by New York standards. Factor in the fact that every pie is 7 euros on Tuesdays and Wednesday's and it would be in the running for best pizza in New York. I ordered the Ramon and it was delicious. I polished the whole thing off by myself in 10 min. Shoutout to the fact that they have legit chile habanero sauce (hard to find actual spicy condiments in Barcelona) and a very tasty housemade chili flake oil (that's right, an oil to drizzle on your pizza, not your traditional sprinkling of chili flakes) to complement the pizza. Looking forward to trying more pies here...",
