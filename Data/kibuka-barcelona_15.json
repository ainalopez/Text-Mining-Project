    "I'm so glad I found sushi in Barcelona using yelp! I ate so much yet had room for more. All the fish was fresh and very tasty. I had my usual, agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, tai nigiri, shrimp tempura roll and one of their creative rolls italiano with mozzarella cheese, tomato, and salmon. The rice to fish ratio was perfect. A lot of the other customers were looking on our table to see what we were eating. I noticed a lot \u00a0of people were ordering from the prefixed menu. I probably would've eaten more if I could translate the menu better.",
