    "As non-meat eaters, we were so happy to discover this little place. It was fantastic for meals on-the-go. It's tiny and can be hard to find seating, and even if you do get a seat, it's not the place to linger/have a long meal. Since we only had a short time in Barcelona and wanted to get to as many sites as possible anyway, this wasn't a deterrent. We ate here a few times because of its dependability, great prices and delicious falafels. Great veggie find!",
