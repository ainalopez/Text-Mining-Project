    "Barcelona and I have a rocky relationship. Sometimes I think we need to break up. However, the one thing I'll always keep near and dear to my heart is this joint. Vaso de Oro is that quintessential tapas place for me. The solomillo with peppers. Their croquetas. Their chocos. Their surprisingly friendly attitudes when you come in (not common in Bcn), all of it is epic. The food is always delicious and it's always a good time. I always eat here at least once whenever I'm Barcelona and strongly recommend you do the same. This is my favorite joint in the entire city. No frills. Good prices. Epic food and good people.",
