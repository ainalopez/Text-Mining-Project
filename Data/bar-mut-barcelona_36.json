    "Food was very good. A few questionable descriptions. We had the shrimp ceviche - no shrimp present... Still delicious, just more of a tomato salad. Must try the egg carpaccio with shoe string potato - mmmm! Octopus with potatoes was super tender - really well cooked. Croquettes were delish as well. A touch expensive.",
