    "Saw good reviews on yelp, was craving indian food so went to Surya! There was no one to seat us, may be that's not the trend in spain! We asked who looked like the server where we can sit, she said I only speak french and spanish! Anyway she told us where to sit, we ordered butter chicken and naan with a chicken tikka naan roll . Both were below average, no spice. Curry was too sweet, bland. I ordered indian chai which not even looked to it. This place is for people who don't know anything about indian food and can be fooled easily.",
