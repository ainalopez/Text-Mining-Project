    "The sandwich of a lifetime. Wow. The line was long and it took a while for me to get my sandwich, but boy was it worth it. For 4.5\u20ac, it was the most delicious sandwich I've ever had. I had the chicken baguette with everything, and I savored every bit. If there's not room in the restaurant, which since it seems to be a popular student joint, eat across the street on one of the benches facing the sea.",
