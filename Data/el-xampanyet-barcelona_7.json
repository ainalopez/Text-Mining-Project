    "Best tapas! We definitely felt like we were in Barcelona at this place and this was one of our first places to eat after we landed. It's loud with people laughing and talking and ordering but that just made the place better. Definitely a fun crowd and feels like they have many regulars come in because I saw the owners hug a bunch of people. Or maybe that's how he greets people who knows... ;) You will see a lot of people lingering outside probably waiting for a table. My friend and I waved him down and was able to get a table pretty fast. LOVED that as soon as we sat down we said we wanted some cava and in one second bam! Bottle of. Love how they drink here. Our style and cheap too!All the tapas were so simple yet delicious and so flavorful. Loved the sardines on toast, jamon on bread, calamari, shrimps (were amazing order these for sure!), olives.. croquettes.. Cheese stuffed peppers .. Everything cheese was delicious. At the end we were drinking with the people next to us and the owner were super nice! Drunk happy and had money to go drink more at the next bar! Yay us!",
