    "We stopped in without a reservation around 9pm and were seated immediately. The waiter was very helpful in recommending a bottle of excellent merlot and a provolone starter with pan con tomate. He didn't just point to the most expensive thing either. So we enjoyed the provolone, bread and wine while waiting for our paella. It was ready no more than 20 mins later and was amazing. The waiter served each of us a plate and nicely arranged the food for us. Between two people there was plenty of food. Having had an appetizer we were unable to finish but not for lack of trying. We stayed and chatted until finishing the bottle of wine and were never pressed to leave. In fact the waiters never approached us and it was quite nice. I also enjoyed the enviroment. It was quite cozy while still having a romantic edge to it. I could see myself returning on my next Bar\u00e7a visit.",
