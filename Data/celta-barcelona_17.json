    "A cafeteria-like bustling tapas bar where there's no such thing as a menu and if you don't know Spanish, expect to point and nod and deal with what you get! It's a fun environment but you need to be assertive and loud enough to make your order. The food is all in a glass-encased window at the counter and you can select what you want, it gets piled on a plate, set at the kitchen window and comes back cooked/fried. \u00a0We tried the potatoes topped with a red spicy sauce, croquette's, sardines (or other small fish as I don't really know what they were), some sort of fried pig skin/fat, and calamari. When ordering such food, the best way to wash it down is with a beer. If you have \u00a0a weak stomach, this may not be a great place to eat as the food is, as mentioned, deep-fried (needless to say, I wasn't feeling the greatest the next day). Although, that could be contributed to lack of water, sleep and too much to drink mixed with fried/greasy food. Regardless, I still recommend going there and yes, I would go back.",
