    "Recommended by the owner of the apartment where we stayed. Awesome lunch of Baby Squid, Garbanzo Beans and roasted peppers - all complemented with Cava (sparking Catalan white wine). Everything was delicious!! Joan (3rd generation owner/operator) was at the counter serving his customers the best food in the La Boqueria Market. Must go when in Barcelona.",
