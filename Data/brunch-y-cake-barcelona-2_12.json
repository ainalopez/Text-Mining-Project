    "Came here on a Sunday early afternoon, and waited about 15 minutes to get seated. Was extremely busy, but we liked the eccentric, farm style vibe it gave off. The plates were either served on a slab of cutting board or cast iron looking pans. We ordered the salmon egg Benedict with a Belgian waffle, turkey bagel, and the ricotta pancake. I wouldn't recommend the salmon at. all. It had a big fishy taste and didn't taste fresh. I had to spit out the fish after I look the first chew. The Belgian waffle that it came with was delicious, and the egg itself was a little too raw for my liking. A perfect egg Benedict is a runny yolk but cooked whites. My whites were still translucent and not cooked. The bagel was delicious, isn't the typical American bagel. This bagel was flaky, almost like a croissant, very big portioned and delicious. It lacked a sauce tho. The plate came with some type of sweet cookie crumble, half slice of bacon, and guacamole- weird combo in my opinion. The ricotta pancake was amazing! The bottom of the pancake was soaked in some type of sweet mixture and the \"hot chocolate\" dipping sauce for the pancake was extremely good. I didn't get the \"caramel popcorn\" that was promised on the menu tho. The bad experience with the salmon really threw me off, and also the 4 eur OJ is ridiculous.... Also, the seating arrangement made my food experience less enjoyable. Tall chairs and short tables just hurts my back thinking about it.",
