    "Really great neighborhood spot with more locals than tourists. It's cozy and the service is friendly and attentive. The food was yummy with healthy portions (even for the tapas!) so we left happy.For the two of us:Goat cheese salad to shareA sandwich with olive pate, ham, and brie cheeseThe catalan sausage with cuttlefishA vermouthA beer (lager)1 cafe americano1 cafeChocolate cake with scoop of vanilla ice creamStill waterAll for a total of about 30 euros. With a small tip, just under $20 U.S. a person for a nice relaxing and yummy dinner.It's situated on a plaza where a lot of locals were hanging (in the outdoor seating) on a Tuesday night. So there were many other places you could \"crawl\" to or try all in one place.Great choice for a mellow Tuesday night dinner.",
