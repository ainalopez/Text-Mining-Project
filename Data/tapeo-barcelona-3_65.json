    "We stopped by for dinner on a Tuesday night. We got here around 8:00 p.m. and the place was packed, \u00a0so we ended up sitting at the bar. Much like many places in Barcelona, this place did not have good service, but the food was fantastic.We started off with the croquetas de jamon iberico. These were very good and the pieces of jamon had a good flavor. We next had the beef with chimichurri sauce. The meat was cooked pretty rare. Nonetheless, the meat was juicy and I really liked this dish. Next up was the cannelloni with sausage and mushroom. This dish was outstanding. The sauce that soaked the pasta was so good that if that was all I ate at this restaurant, I would have left happy. Our last dish was some grilled vegetables with mushrooms that did not have much flavor.If you want some good tapas at a decent price, this is a great spot.",
