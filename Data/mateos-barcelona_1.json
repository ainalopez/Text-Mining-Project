    "I came here because it was two blocks from my flat, I needed a quite restuarant rather than a tapas bar and because I knew that since this is Barcelona, the food would still be good at almost any place and it was.It's more upscale in appearance than I assumed with modern design and decor. There are selections of montaditos, tapas, fried seafood and cured meats. Price are more than at a bar but still quite good. The food of course was good and good quality.It's accessible and the lighting \u00a0is good.",
