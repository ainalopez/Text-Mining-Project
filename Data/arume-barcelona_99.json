    "Great experience! \u00a0We visited because of the other reviews on Yelp. Good customer service and english menu available. \u00a0We did not have a reservation so we ate at the bar, and we were lucky because many other folks came in and were told to wait a while without reservation. The food was delicious and a great value. We shared the salmon appetizer, seafood paella & lamb for main courses, shared a cookie for desert, and shared a pitcher of sangria all for 58 euro.",
