    "Excellent service and the beef was cooked to perfection. The quality of the food was one of the best I've ever had. Try the wagyu beef or tasting menu. Amazing restaurant with professional service at its best. Only thing that disturbed us was that the lights were far too bright, which made it less cozy.Thanks again. Don't miss this if you love beef!",
