    "Sleek restaurant a bit tight quarters and very intense lighting that detracted from the meal. \u00a0Wait staff was most helpful navigating the extensive menu. \u00a0Tapas were delicious and a bit more adventurous that other tapas bars. \u00a0Their pa amb tomaquet far and away the best we ate in Barcelona. \u00a0Especially noteworthy were all the seafood dishes.",
