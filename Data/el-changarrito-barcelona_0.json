    "All the staff at this restaurant very welcoming and served us in a timely manner. All of the food we had was amazing. We started off with guacamole, and even if I hadn't watched the waiter chopping up tomatoes at the bar, I would've been able to tell how fresh it was. The taco al pastor, taco de mole verde, and taco de tinga de pollo were all amazing (and only 2 euros each). However, I would highly recommend the enchiladas verdes. We finished off the night with some tres leches cake, which was delectable like all the other dishes. This restaurant made me wish I wasn't just visiting Barcelona. Definitely give it a try.",
