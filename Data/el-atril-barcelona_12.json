    "Of all the hundreds of Tapas places I've tried in Spain, this is still one of my favorites. \u00a0When I first stumbled upon this place a couple of years ago, there was nothing in that courtyard except an old Roman wall, and little else. \u00a0Now that square has several hip restaurants, and the area has a pretty good vibe. \u00a0I never ate inside, only outside on the patio. \u00a0Prices were reasonable, service was relaxed and friendly. \u00a0This is a keeper.oh - i'm told that they also have live music on the weekend... I'll have to try going there on a weekend night soon!",
