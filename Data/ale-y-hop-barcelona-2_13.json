    "Fun spot with an excellent beer selection. The Vegan burgers were amongst the best I've had anywhere, but small as they were tapas sized. The menu as a whole is limited whether you're Vegan or Vegetarian which was the one down side to this place. The atmosphere was cool and the waitstaff a ton of fun.I would gladly visit again if I were to return to Barcelona.",
