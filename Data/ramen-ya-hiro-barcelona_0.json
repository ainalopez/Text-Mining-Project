    "There's always line for this place every day, and people can wait for around an hour to get seated. The redeeming value is that you can order drinks and have them while you're standing. The ramen soup is the star of the show, it needs no further mentioning. It's up there with the great ramens of Tokyo. I argued with my friends many times about eating Japanese food in Barcelona, but I stand corrected at Hiro.",
