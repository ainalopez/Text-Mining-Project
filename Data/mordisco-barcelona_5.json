    "We enjoyed our meal so much the first time, we went back another evening. \u00a0 \u00a0On our second visit, our service was so poor as to be bizarre. \u00a0The waiter broke a wine glass on the floor right next to our table, splashing wine on my pants and foot, and didn't even bother to clean up the broken glass! \u00a0He finally disappeared altogether, and a second waiter was conscripted to complete our dinner service. \u00a0As to the food, they serve tapas with fresh ingredients, including vegetables, and it was all delicious. \u00a0The presentation was attractive. \u00a0 Guests are either seated at the bar or on the patio, which is intimate and yet spacious. \u00a0We ate on the patio on both visits. \u00a0 Clientele seemed to be a mix of locals, corporate visitors, and some tourists. \u00a0If not for the service on our second visit I would have rated this restaurant with four stars. \u00a0I think they need an on site manager.",
