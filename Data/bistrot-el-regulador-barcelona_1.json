    "Restaurant at the lobby of a 5 star hotel. It is a small place since it is officially part of the hotel but nonetheless the food is amazing. Reso needed. We ordered the tenderloin (beef), which was sliced but great still. My app was the beef carpaccio with arugula and Parmesan cheese therefore the classic kind - solid. My date had the salad with foie gras and be licked his plate. It was def a fancy Resto judging by the presentation and the portion of the food (smaller portions and more interesting and Michelin star like presentations). I wouldn't say it's local food at all other than the wine selection. But if you are in search of a classy meal with good service in am ambiance that is intimate you should check it out. It's a nice change from the craziness of the city and let alone the street las ramblas!",
