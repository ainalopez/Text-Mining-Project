    "Walking in here, we were surrounded with by other Asian couples and families...\"Are you guys using Yelp and Trip Advisor too?\" we wondered. Such a fascinating observation, but amusing to say the least. :)Anyway, glad we all got pointed in the direction of La Fonda. Almost every table had sangria and paella and as did we! Both were great choices, but not THE BEST. I am still looking for the paella that's bursting at the seams with fresh seafood and has that crispy crust from the pan. This paella had a softer rice than I prefer with small pieces of squid throughout but with mussels and shrimp that seemed to be frozen. Yikes! This coupled with so so service makes it a 3 star for me. Needless to say, the search continues....",
