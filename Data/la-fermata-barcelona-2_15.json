    "AMAZING pizza. Absolutely the best.So - I was just visiting Barcelona, so what do I know about their pizza scene? At the same rate, I've spent enough time in Rome to know good pizza.This is pizza al corte, by the slice, done just right, mozzarella di bufala, you name it, all the gold standards.Among the amazing food of Barcelona firmly sits La Fermata. Could you ask for better pizza in Barcelona? I think not!Please, for your own good, stop here on your way to La Pedrara! Guaranteed success.Thanks for listening!",
