    "Big J's is all right. Definitely reminiscent of a Johnny Rocket's, but it does not quite hit the mark.To be fair, I didn't find a place in all of Barcelona that had good \"American food,\" but this place did try. The banana milkshake was yummy, but the cheddar fries were topped with a kind of ambiguous cheese-whiz substance. \"A\" for effort when it comes to the ambiance and decor. They even played the Super Bowl here! The food was OK, so come only if you're craving a good ole' American shake & fries.",
