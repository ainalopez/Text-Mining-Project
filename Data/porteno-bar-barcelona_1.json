    "This bar is brand new, but has the drink menu and service figured out. Of all the places we visited in our week in Barcelona, the service and attentiveness to every detail of our visit was by far the best. Aside from the service, the drinks were incredible. The ingredients were top quality and the care in making them paid off. I normally don't visit the same place twice while traveling, but I made an exception. Porteno wins the prize - best mojito and best caipirinha in Barcelona. (The Pisco sours at the table over were impressive, too!)Thank you Miguel and crew!",
