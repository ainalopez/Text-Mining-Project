    "I don't write too many reviews and I write this one with mixed emotions. \u00a0When looking for a high quality tapas experience in the area of my hotel, I came across Bar Bas. I walked over on a Monday night only to find the restaurant closed. No problem, I went a few doors down to another popular restaurant and had a nice meal with some friends. The following night I walked by again to find Bar Bas open! \u00a0After deciding to sit at the bar, \u00a0I could immediately tell that this was a place that took great pride in serving quality food and drink. The service was meticulous but not overbearing. The food was prepared with high quality fresh ingredients and attention to detail. \u00a0I would highly recommend Bar Bas because the food and service were wonderful. I'm only reluctant because I was able to easily get a seat at 8:30 when many nearby tapas places had lines of people waiting for mediocre food. I hope they are successful because they deserve to be, but I also want to be able to go any time and get a seat. If you like them as well, tell some friends - but not too many.",
