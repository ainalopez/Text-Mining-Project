    "Sunday night at 7pm, no reservation? No problem here, very gracious service. Excellent terrace water view, good service- not hovering but available. Food was outstanding, really everything we had was fantastic. Lovely meal, view and experience! Recommend! Was completely full by 8pm, so be warned that you would need reservations.",
