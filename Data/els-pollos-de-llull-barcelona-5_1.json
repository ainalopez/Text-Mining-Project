    "The chicken here was moist and tasty but nothing super amazing. The lunch specials seem like a better deal than the normal dinner menu. The vegetables we ordered with the meal were rather stingy, I thought, simply grilled without much flavor and only a few pieces of each vegetable. When I went, the restaurant was completely empty. It's actually quite a cute and clean place with an open kitchen. It's a nice place but nothing to go out of your way for.",
