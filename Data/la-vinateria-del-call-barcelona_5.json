    "we found this restaurant through our lonely planet guide book of spain and it just happened to be near where we were sightseeing for the day. \u00a0it was a little tricky getting here since it was located in a narrow alley, just off placa sant jaume.to drink, i ordered a bottle of still water (\u20ac2,40) and hubby ordered a glass of white wine (\u20ac2). \u00a0these drinks were a bit on the pricey side, certainly more expensive than other restaurants we'd been to.after perusing the menu a bit, we placed our orders, and within minutes, were given a basket of catalan style bread. \u00a0this was our first time having this type of bread and we were delighted when the waiter told us that it consisted of white bread with crushed tomatoes and salt. \u00a0i'd never had this combo before and it was quite tasty, and the salt was much appreciated esp since it was so hot outside. \u00a0the crushed tomatoes tasted like a very fresh tomato paste, which was great.for our mains, we had an assortment of tapas:+marinated leeks (\u20ac6,60) - these were marinated with a salty brown sauce and resembled picked veggies. \u00a0they were served cold which was refreshing on this very warm day.+assorted vegetables (\u20ac6,60) - a colourful plate of grilled red and green peppers and onions. \u00a0the veggies were fresh and seasoned very well.+cheese plate (\u20ac6,50)- a plate filled with lots of creamy slices of cheese. \u00a0i don't know what it is, but the cheese in spain is just so savory delicious! \u00a0although i probably shouldn't have, i ended up finishing every last piece!+iberian ham (\u20ac17,00) - this was all hubby and i guess he liked it or was really hungry b/c he finished every piece of ham til the plate was clean as a whistle!we didn't have any room for dessert, probably b/c i ate too much cheese, but that's ok b/c our bellies were very full and happy.to our dismay, we saw that we were actually charged \u20ac3,80 for the catalan style bread on our bill. \u00a0apparently, in spain, some restaurants will charge you for bread, and some don't. \u00a0if you're unsure, it's best to ask so that you're not caught off guard when you receive the bill!although prices were a bit high, the service was great and we appreciated the friendly waiters who spoke a decent amount of english. \u00a0definitely a very good recommendation from lonely planet!",
