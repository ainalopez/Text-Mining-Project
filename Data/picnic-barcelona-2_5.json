    "While vacationing in Barcelona last month we enjoyed an amazing meal at PICNIC restaurant in El Born district. \u00a0The prix fixe brunch menu they offer daily includes (per person): 1 starter, 1 main meal, 1 dessert, wine or beer, AND coffee. \u00a0I'm not sure prix fixe menus get much better than PICNIC's!I started with the tomates verdes fritos, con queso feta y salsa fresca. \u00a0Translation: the most amazing fried tomato ever made! \u00a0I'm not a fan of tomatoes, at all, but PICNIC may have slightly converted me. \u00a0For my main dish I chose eggs benedict with bacon and spinach on an english muffin. \u00a0After devouring both delectable courses, it was time for dessert. \u00a0At this point in the meal I was completely satisfied and didn't need to order the mini pancakes with maple syrup, strawberries, and creme fraiche. \u00a0However, I was on vacation and I was not going to turn down dessert! \u00a0I complemented my brunch experience with a glass of white wine and a cup of caf\u00e9 americano. \u00a0I definitely recommend PICNIC to anyone visiting the Born district. \u00a0I would love to go back one day.",
