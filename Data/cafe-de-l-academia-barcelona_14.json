    "Amazing! \u00a0This was the best meal that I have ever had. \u00a0The food was delicious and the service was excellent. \u00a0The food was so tasty and beautifully presented. \u00a0The menu had full and half portions for many of the dishes which allowed you to create a nice tasting menu. \u00a0I was hesitant to write such a positive review because I don't want it to be too crowded when I return, however, it really is deserving of the praise. \u00a0My husband and I have eaten out all over the world and this experience really stands out.",
