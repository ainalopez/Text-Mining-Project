    "What a great place! A restaurant in which you feel welcome as a tourist in a new town. We were served with a high level of sincerety and enthousiasm. Where do you find that these days! The food was very good and affordable. My daughter enjoyed a tuna pizza and chocolate dessert. I had an excellent pizza of the house and tiramisu. If you want to eat Italian in Spain: this is the place to be!",
