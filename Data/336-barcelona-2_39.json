    "Absolutely amazing!!!With a party of 8, we made a reservation for Monday at 8pm. \u00a0Seated right away and offered the fixed price menu. \u00a0For 22 euros, the wait staff suggested an assortment of starters which included bruchetta, asparagus, mussels, prawns, potatoes with foie gras (and I may have missed one starter). \u00a0Our party was nearly stuffed after just the starters.For the main course, I had the rabbit. \u00a0It was very good. \u00a0Others in our party had the cod, turbot, calamari, salmon and beef tenderloin. \u00a0Universally, the comments from our party were excellent.Add in choice of dessert (sorbet / ice cream / creme brulee) , a glass of sparkling wine to start plus water/wine during the dinner and you have a tremendous value for superbly excellent food.We finished our dinner and departed at 11pm. \u00a0By the time we left, the restaurant was full and only one table had turned over. \u00a0Clearly what Brandon C had been told was indeed correct, as our party was there for three hours and the restaurant was full on a rainy day/night.The staff was wonderful. \u00a0After the meal, we were taking pictures in front of the restaurant and the chef came out front to greet us. \u00a0He is from Chicago and if you seem him, be sure to ask to see his picture with a former US president!",
