    "This was definitely out favourite restaurant of the trip!! The food was amazing! We shared a whole bunch of tapas between 4, and the potatoes with egg and foie gras and also a plate of pepita.Food was slightly more expensive than the other meals we had in the 3 day trip, but worth every penny. Definitely order the marinated seabass, marinated salmon, and the potatoes with foie gras!!!! Need i say more?!?!",
