    "I ordered the Salmon and Cream Cheese crepe....I loved it! There was no customers inside when we showed up, but by the time we left it was busy. We also got the nutella and strawberries crepe as well as the chocolate and ice cream crepe. We left stuffed. We all were in a food couma. For 4 people and 6 crepes about 45euros....It was so worth it and I wanna go back before I leave. The ladies were nice and the place was clean. Go...you won't be dissapointed.",
