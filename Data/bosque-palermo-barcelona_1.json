    "1st night in Barcelona, We tried this restaurant because of Yelp - and location We ordered a dry cheese app & a bottle of house wine - wine @ 9 euros was pretty decent. No bread was served, I thought that was oddOrdered the mixed Paella for 2 \u00a0@ 10 euros pp.which I thought was just ok. I won't be backTo many other places to try here",
