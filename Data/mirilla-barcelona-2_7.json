    "We stumbled into this glorious establishment during our recent trip to Barcelona in May. This place was but a stone's throw from our apartment, and every time we walked by it was always packed. By the third night, we just had to go and see what the buzz was about- and I am so glad we did! The atmosphere is bohemian chic and the menu boasts of homegrown ingredients and specials based on what's in season. We ordered 1 of almost everything(and 2 orders of jamon croquettes for good measure). EVERYTHING WAS DEVINE! The service was exceptional- and the owners are really cool and interesting to talk to. I am looking forward to visiting Barcelona again so that I can go to mirilla!",
