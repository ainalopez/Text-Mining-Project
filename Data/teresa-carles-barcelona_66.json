    "What a gem! My family and I stumbled onto this place traveling through Spain and fell in love. We liked it so much, we ate there three times on our vacation.The menu has great variety and the vegan options made eating out with a dairy allergy easy. The food was fresh and well prepared.The staff is pleasant and helpful. This is a place you can eat at guilt free about what you are putting in your body.",
