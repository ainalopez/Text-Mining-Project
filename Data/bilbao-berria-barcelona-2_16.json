    "Great tapas bar. Lots of choices for all palate. Each \"montadito\" is \u20ac1.70, they will count the amount of tooth picks on your plate, and charge you accordingly. Nice, fun atmosphere. Table are very close to each other and lots of tourist talking to each other. You can also seat outside. No service per say except for your drinks. Worth a try.",
