    "Easily one of the best tapas places in the area, Irati Taverna Basca offers a wide variety of delicious tapas for only \u20ac1.95 per toothpick. Just looking inside Irati Taverna Basca is a five star experience - you're greeted by a large bar completely covered with dozens of varieties of tapas. Ordering food is simple - walk inside, ask someone behind the counter for a plate (their English is excellent), and start loading up your plate. Each tapas is \u20ac1.95 and is counted up when you're done by counting the toothpicks. There's no need to worry about the amount of food, as each tapas is its own small meal, and you'll probably only eat somewhere between 5-7 to feel full. Also be sure to try some of the wine, which is the best cheap wine you'll ever taste. It's busy around lunch and dinner and the crowd is mostly tourists (this restaurant is featured in Rick Steves' travel books), but don't let it discourage you, as it's worth the crowds.",
