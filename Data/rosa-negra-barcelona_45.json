    "I usually don't go to Mexican restaurants. Specially on travel. I am doing market research and I was sent to this place. I only had a drink. I had a Pacifico \"michelada\", which was ok. Not the best, but good on a hot summer day. The decor was Mexican hip. The general color theme was taken from Clorox (a Mexican bleach brand) and the usual bright colors. I liked it. The waitress? not so good. At our arrival, we were asked if we were there to eat and we responded \"only a drink\". \u00a0She took an unusual amount of time to get our order and then never came back. After 30 minutes we paid the bartender and left.",
