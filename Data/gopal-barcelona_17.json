    "Was feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the animal protein i was eating in Phoenix and searched this place out as a more veggie centric alternative. i will say, the layout is nice and I like the display case of their vegan options, such as the variety of burgers - I had the mushroom one which was well, a bit too mushroom centric for me ( I know, I ordered it, what was I expecting, right?), but my mother, also on the trip here, got a different one, which was much nicer. I also did not care for the sandwich format, a bit too much vegan mayo on the veggie burger but I did like the homemade fries with vegan mayo - I would recommend the veggie burger with a salad option and a nice selection of euro specific sodas - I had the pomegranate one for an extra half a euro on the meal deal. Honestly, at home, in the states, I might give this place 3 stars but it is just so different from anything else I came across in the old town part of Barcelona that I felt it deserved another star.",
