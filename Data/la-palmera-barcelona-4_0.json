    "Hotel Condes has a perfect location and its services and the service we were very happy. From the hotel I had been close to the center and the sea. This hotel in Barcelona offered us an extraordinary range of trips and entertainment activities. Hotel staff helped us with everything and knew how great of course, three world languages. I'm in a hotel every day she visited a sauna and massage. Our room was cozy and with a great view of the whole city. The hotel had 24 service and do anything for us. The breakfasts are prepared each day fresh sandwiches or scrambled eggs. This hotel in Barcelona was a really good price, and we've all been very satisfied. By Hotel Condes is still definitely go back.",
