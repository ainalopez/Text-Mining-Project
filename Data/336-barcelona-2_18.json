    "This place was amazing and is a block from the Renaissance hotel. We dined for lunch with a mult-course meal. Portions are huge, but no English is spoken. We googled the menu and got the gist of it. We ordered the \"peach\" dessert and got a whole peach with a knife. Guess I need to work on my Spanish. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner.",
