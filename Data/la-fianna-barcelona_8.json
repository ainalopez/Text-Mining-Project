    "La Fianna has now moved. Its only a mere 100 yards away but new address is Carrer de Manressa, No 4. Situated in a great area of the Born in the heart of Barcelona with plenty of local patrons this place was a find, albeit it took me about 30 minutes to find the place. Google map it and you shall find but print it off so you dont get lost like i did. Truly this place was so great, I did not want to leave nothing to do with the pint sized mojitos or beautiful and interesting people to be viewed. The menu was excellent with rich flavoured dishes to suit most tastes. The Carpaccio of beef with rocket and Parmesan melted in my mouth and the infamous chocolate coolant was delicious. The place was buzzing from when we got there and we did not leave till about 1.30. Congrats to you whomever you are, good job, nice staff, good food and tremendous atmosphere. One of the Great Barcelona restaurants",
