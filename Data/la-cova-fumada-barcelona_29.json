    "Went here for a late lunch after a nice day of tanning at the beach per the recommendation of our AirBnB host! Eat absolutely everything you can and definitely don't skip the bombas. \u00a0I am going to go ahead and say that the bacon here was SO unbelievably delicious it nearly brought tears to my eyes. \u00a0Here is a complete list of everything you should eat (worth the wait!): artichoke heart, bomba (Fried mashed potato and ground beef), codfish fritters, calamari, shrimp , squid, morcilla (blood sausage), and pan de alioli.",
