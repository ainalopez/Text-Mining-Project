    "A delicious haven off the touristy sh*tshow that is La Rambla, Pinotxo is the perfect place for a quick, delicious lunch. Grab a fresh fruit juice from a nearby stall and wait for a stool to open up. Allow the charming se\u00f1or to offer you a few dishes or get what everyone around you is getting. The chickpeas, sausage, and tomato with fresh mozzarella were perfection.",
