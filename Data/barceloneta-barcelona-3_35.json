    "amazing. \u00a0cant say enough. \u00a0we got a table right away on our last night in Barcelona. \u00a0our waiter brought and brought, we ate and ate. \u00a0the last item we ate was the salt encrusted sea bass. OMG. my favorite is the black paella. \u00a0explosion of flavor. \u00a0 Sitting upstairs in a \"patio\" like area watching the sun set was the perfect last night in a beautiful city.",
