    "Came here and got take-away for our first night in Barcelona. The pasta was OK, but the menu set was super worth it -- you get your dish with a drink and dessert. My favorite were the empanadas! We got three different ones (onion, cheese, and beef); all of them were super tasty and came with a delicious sauce. The desserts were amazing as well (not too sweet, just right), we had the Argentinean cakes, brownie, and tiramisu. The Argentinean cakes were ah-may-zing.",
