    "A cosy, romantic, peaceful spot with delicious, great value tapas. We stayed for almost 3 hours and there was no rushing us out despite the place filling up. The waiter didn't speak much English but communicated as best as he could with hand gestures and a warm smile! We ordered the chorizo, the prawn rolls, the foie gras, the tomato bread and the garlic mushrooms (we'd been walking around all day and worked up a solid appetite!). The foie gras was one of the best I've ever had and the prawn rolls were fresh and crispy. To this we added a white chocolate and pistachio cheesecake which was so creamy, and the pistachio added a great edge. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the place we ate in the night before was out of this world, which is probably a little unfair but Born is a competitive area. I'll definitely be back next time in Barcelona.",
