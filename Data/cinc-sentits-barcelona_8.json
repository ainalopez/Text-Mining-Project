    "One of the top three fine dining experiences we had in Spain, which includes surpassing meals at Alkemia in Barcelona and Ramon Freixa in Madrid.You know great things are to be expected when your palate is primed with a decadant shot of maple syrup, cream, and cava sabayon. \u00a0From that point on, it was just plate after plate of clean, well articulated food with flavours that make you stop and notice.Definitely not to be missed, a dining experience I would couple with a trip to Gresca to really make your visit to Barcelona unforgettable.",
