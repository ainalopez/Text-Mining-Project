    "i'm actually sad... disappointed that they didn't serve paella when I came in the restaurant... (COME before midnight =P) clearly it was our fault. \u00a0Anyway. as a non red meat and pork eater, we opted for the sea food dishes!!! \u00a0OMG... after we ordered the grilled prawns (along w/ a salad mixta and gazpacho) we were ready to order more sea food dishes when he interrupted and asked, \"Are you really hungry?\" we said yes.. because we were, we only had a sandwich all day and a cocktail at Sitges (i digress) anyway- he recommended the fish sampler (i don't recall the name on the menu) do not get caught up w/ the name \"FISH SAMPLER\" it's a \"SEA FOOD SAMPLER\" it was SO MUCH GOSH DARN DELICIOUSLY AMAZING SEAFOOD i've everrr had... BEST PLACE EVERRRRRRR.... i love our waiter and knowing his customers!!!!! \u00a0and after a seafood feast and a bottle of their house wine and \u00a02 desserts.... 25Euros each is a heck of a great deal... specially for BARCELONA!!!! \u00a0 i highly recommend it!!!!!! \u00a0yummmmmmmmm \u00a0that's all =P",
