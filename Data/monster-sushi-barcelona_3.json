    "Recently my wife and cousin visited Barcelona. I had a strong desire for some sushi so I got online and googled sushi restaurants in Barcelona. Monster Sushi caught my eye and I went to their website to checkout the menu. I noticed California rolls and some other entrees that sounded delicious. I made reservations for three and we went. From beginning to end the experience was amazing. We order strawberry and passion fruit mojitos. They were made with fresh fruit and the taste definitely displayed that. I ordered the California mix rolls which were extremely delicious. Upon attempting to order additional California rolls our waiter suggested a different type of sushi that he thought we would enjoy. Tuna and salmon rolls. Great suggestion! They were delicious! We topped the evening off with dessert. New York style cheesecake with a chocolate crust and carrot cake. Overall the service was great. The food amazing and I will definitely recommend Monster Sushi to anyone who wants to try new rings and eat great sushi while traveling in Barcelona.",
