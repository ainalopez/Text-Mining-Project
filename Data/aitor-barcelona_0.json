    "I tried this restaurant a few days ago about 8:45 pm and I'm glad I did! I fumbled through some basic spanish and was able to get what I needed and had a great selection of tapas. Opting for the buffet so I could try a bunch of things, each thing I had was delicious. When you walk in you can choose to sit at the bar (where the tapas are set out, you just grab a plate and pick what you'd like) or at one of the lower tables. I chose the bar and had a nice view of the TV which had a football game on and a view of the street to people watch as well. All in, for unlimited tapas and a beer was about \u20ac17. Definitely recommend this tapas bar - it was busy but not crowded and the service was nice and did their best to communicate with me as much as I tried to communicate with them. The food was awesome, too!",
