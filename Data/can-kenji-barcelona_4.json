    "Made a reservation via skype for 8:30 pm, 5 people on the same day as dining. We were seated immediately, the place was very busy. I had the best tuna nigiri bite I've ever had. My order of clam and squid udon was not too large, and it was sublime. The \"kids\" loved the shiitake risotto- two orders. Creamy miso soup was good. Tuna tataki (lightly seared) with guacamole was a treat. Skip the ensalada with raw fish, I felt like I was eating leftover fish morsels, not the best bits of fish, however the carrot ginger dressing was yummy. 74 euro for 5 people, no dessert, one aqua, two beers, two sodas.",
