    "This place was amazing!! We went to five Tapas places on Thursday night (which...FYI everything is half price), and this place was my favorite. It was quiet at 7:30pm, but come 8:30-9:00pm...was SO packed!! But fun!! Plenty of places to stand and enjoy. The longer you are there, the more different things you see. Beer and wine are great. Sangria is great! When he handed me the Sangria I was skeptical, but it was very good. Great music and vibe!",
