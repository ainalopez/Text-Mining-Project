    "Comfy restaurant located in el born. We were greeted by enthusiastic wait staff. After finding tapas tourist traps everywhere we looked, this was a refreshing find.I was able to finally try an authentic Catalan dish - Catalan chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and served with tasty vegetables on the side. The sauce complemented the meal well. Of course we started the evening with pan con tomate!Cool old world decor inside.It was a nice evening out.",
