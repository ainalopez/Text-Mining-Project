    "Unexpectedly stumbled into the burger joint and was surprised by the variety of choices and rustic interior. Ordered a classic cheese burger with Monterey Jack cheese with mustard and ketchup. Grilled medium rare (as it should be) and quite a larger size than used to. Meat was tender and juicy. Great alternative to the Kebab bars in the neighborhood. Would definitely recommend.",
