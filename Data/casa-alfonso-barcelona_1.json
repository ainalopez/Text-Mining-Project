    "Amazing food, old-school atmosphere, and popular with locals. Get your tapas + paella fix without spending mad Euros, and hang out in a historic building that has been around for over 80 years.Loved:- The simple dishes - tomato on bread (must love olive oil), mushroom paella, patas bravas. Or maybe I just love carbs.- The paellas come in smallish pans so you can sample a few without needing to unbuckle your pants- Bull (ox) tail croquettes (all were good, but these were pretty unique)Could use a little work:- Grilled garlic squid - a bit overly salty, on top of loads of garlic. Still good though.- The bomb - seems to be a common menu item around town, but not much different that just a large croquetteNote:- restaurant opens at 1 pm on Saturdays, not noon as Yelp page indicates- probably should make a reservation, as locals like this place and it fills up",
