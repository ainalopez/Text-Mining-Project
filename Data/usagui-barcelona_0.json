    "Words can't describe the vibes one can get from this place. Green tea is just the start. Underground location with nice lighting and amazing variety of mixed fusions with green tea and the food is also a plus but more than anything the people cater to you and everything was great.Just as long as you promise not to leave without eating their green tea/choco cake. One of the best and most unique cakes of the world",
