    "My husband and I made reservations for a Tuesday night at 9 pm. We did not know what to expect, but we happily surprised by the delicious meal we had. The server didn't speak much English, but she was so friendly and helpful just the same. The chef made a recommendation for the wine, so we went with the white wine he chose and it was lovely. We both did the 35 euro tasting menu. We had a squid ink croquette, scallop ceviche, shrimp and corn soup, delicious foie, iberico pork, fish, cherry tomato pastry, and strawberry sundae. Everything was delicious and well executed. The flavors were amazing and every dish was perfectly seasoned. It was very well priced for how inventive the food was. They also brought out some delicious warm homemade bread. Being the Americans we are, we downed the bread, and they kept bringing more out and we kept eating it. Beware that you are charged for all the bread you eat. Just something we are not used to. Also the restaurant is small, and the chef and sous chef serve the tables. It is a very intimate environment and a great experience. The neighborhood is a fun area to grab a drink afterwards too.",
