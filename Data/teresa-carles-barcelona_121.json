    "My husband and I went here for my birthday meal while we were on vacation in Barcelona a few weeks ago. I eat meat, but not like the Spaniards do, so I was up for a classy veg meal. This place did not disappoint. The location is right off Las Ramblas, and the decor was lovely and warm. I can't stop thinking about my entree-- the aubergine cake. I think it was the best meal I've had in years. The cheesecake we shared for dessert was light and fresh. The husband, a serious meat stew kind of guy, also said it was one of the best meals he'd had in a while-- no small feat for a veg restaurant!",
