    "Picked at place at random wandering the streets of Barcelona - it was the best find of our trip. \u00a0The food is excellent, the place is cute, and the staff was very nice. \u00a0We had three appetizers and skipped the main course. \u00a0All the appetizers were excellent \u00a0- a pate salad, foie gras and potato filled with curried chicken. \u00a0The last one was our favorite. \u00a0We planned to come back to try out the main courses but that will have to wait until our next visit to Barcelona",
