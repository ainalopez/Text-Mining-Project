    "I was excited to see a ramen place rated so high in Barcelona so I had to come try it out. It was a very nice little shop, beautifully decorated with familiar Japanese art and figurines. Disappointed that they had no tonkotsu broth and disappointed by the wait from the time we ordered til the time the food arrived in front of us (was about 30mins).As for the quality of the food I was very impressed. I had both the tsukemen and soja. Both were phenomenal. I was expecting the tsukemen broth to be dense but it was just like regular broth. Despite this, the cold noodles fused very well with the broth. It was amazing! Would recommend getting there a bit early before it opens",
