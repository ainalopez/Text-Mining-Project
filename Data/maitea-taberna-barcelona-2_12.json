    "This was so good! And a great experience for a foodie with no knowledge of Spanish cuisine and tapas. The best is in the bar area. It is long and has lots of bar Stools. The regular menu and reservation only Restaurant at the back didn't seem as appealing. The idea is to eat Pintxos . \u00a0These open face sandwiches are displayed in cases at the bar and you can just grab. The cold ones displayed favourites include a black olive and anchovy, cream cheese with raisins and walnuts, smoked salmon, tuna and hot pepper, etc. You can also order as many as you want (1.65 each) \u00a0off the end which will be hot. They also come around and serve new ones. We got about 6 to 9 prices and where really full at the end of it. For dessert they had a large menu and specials that all looked good. We went for the Torrija friend milk bread with sugar. I've been craving one for a while. This is good. Total with wine we got 52\u20ac \u00a0Great for dates.",
