    "I love this place. My friend and I luckily came \"early\" around 8pm and found a spot for two. It's not a big space so we were happy to find a seat. The wine we got was amazing. I had a red and my friend had a white. I was so happy with the wine I wasn't even worried about the tapas we ordered. We ordered three small ones to share and they were fantastic. It was also very nice that the waitress we had spoke very good English. We got lucky. I would make this a regular spot.",
