    "We are so full from The amazing seafood paella that we can barely write this review - but wanted to write it while it was still fresh in our minds. We were looking for a good paella in the area, and decided on this is place because of the Yelp reviews. We would have given it 5 stars but they were out of the Crema Catal\u00e0n. We each started with salad, ensalada verde an ensalada with salmon and hearts of lettuce. The only dressing they offer is oil and vinegar on the table, which is actually simple and delicious. \u00a0We also had the pan con tomate y aceta de oliva which is always a good accompaniment. Then came the seafood paella and everything about it blew us away. There was plenty of seafood including fresh shrimp, clams, muscles and calamari nestled in a hot pan of saffron rice. The rice had peas, pimientos, garlic and was seasoned with saffron and smokey paprika. While it could have been more well done so the bottom had a caramelized crust, we still enjoyed everything about it. All in all the price for 3 of us including 2 bottles of vino blanco de la Casa was around \u20ac20 euro per person. The waitstaff (Michele) was very patient with our broken spanish and let us take our time. We will be back!",
