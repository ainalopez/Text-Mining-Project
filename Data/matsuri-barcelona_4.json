    "Alright, I'm so very torn about this place. Food: awesome. (I had the thai curry and it was delicious and the salmon nigiri was like bomb.com) Decor/Ambiance: great, fun, dark and maybe romantic? -- AKA goodService: kind of bad... I will admit that we sat on the \"sushi bar\" side as opposed to the \"restaurant\" side of the place, and that could account for the poor service. But, all of the dishes in our party arrived at vastly different times (enough so that my friend had completely finished eating and my meal had yet to arrive), and the waitress was rude-ish and inattentive. However, the main chef brought out a few dishes and was delightful and fun. He saved the service day as far as I'm concerned.Essentially, try out the place for some good food, but know that you may be paying a little more and still not be getting the good service that you think you're paying for.",
