    "I couldn't believe how good this place is! It's is indeed more expensive than the other tapas restaurant. But the food quality is excellent!The waiter recommended ordering 4-5 dishes for 2 people since the portion is not big. We had steak tartar, mozzarella and tomato salad, fricand\u00f3 \"finger food\" and grilled onglet. All the meat dishes are really delicious! The meat quality is obviously very high and everything is cooked to be tender and juicy.In addition, we tried dessert as well. Catalan cream is like cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but with fluffy cream. At first it felt very decadent, like shoving whipped cream in your mouth. But it's just impossible to stop... The other is tocinillo which is similar to a flan. It comes with green apple sorbet to mix sweet and sour taste.The service was really attentive as well. When we were having the steak tartar, whenever we finish the crispy bread, the waiter would hand us a new plate immediately. I definitely recommend this place if you want to spend a bit more to get quality food!",
