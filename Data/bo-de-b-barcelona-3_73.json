    "This is the best bargain lunch spot in Barcelona. In fact, its a steal at just 3 euro for what you get! The meat (your choice of chicken, beef, or season tofu) is cooked to order and then you choose from an exhaustive selection of sauces and toppings to create your own unique sandwich. The small restaurant can be hard to find, but the long line wrapped around the building corner should grab you attention. It is important to note that this line is the to-go line!!! If you want to eat your sandwich there, then pop inside and try to grab a table (although there are only about 5 or 6). The best part of the sandwich was definitely the crusty bread though. I normally eat my sandwiches open-face to save myself the carbs, but I made an exception for this delicious roll. Just make sure that you have a good supply of napkins on hand because they are not shy with the sauces!",
