    "Really pretty and really cheap. \u00a0I had house wine (white), which was crisp and sweet, for only 2 Euros. \u00a0WHAT! \u00a0Water is.. 60 cents cheaper?! \u00a0Um.. more wine please.Food was also pretty good - especially the appetizer, the suckling pig was fatty heaven in my mouth! \u00a0The seaweed salad it was served on was also tasty and sweet. \u00a0For entree, I ordered the cod, which was lightly battered and fried. \u00a0The fish wasn't as soft and moist as I had hoped, but the cream sauce and the jelly cubes it was served with was delicious.The decor is also pretty Euro upscale - really pretty with intricate designs, glasswork, and well-placed lights. \u00a0Definitely a nice place for couples - I was the odd one eating by my lonesome self.Service was also solid here - waitresses were very attending, and brought my bill fairly quickly without me asking after I started giving hints like putting my card on the table (a first here in Barcelona so far!)Whole bill (including water) came to be around 22 euros for dinner. \u00a0And, this place is located really close to Las Ramblas, which is very touristy. \u00a0So, amazing deal! \u00a0Definitely would recommend - especially if you don't want to wait in line at Fonda next door.",
