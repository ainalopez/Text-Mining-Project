    "This place has become my wife and I's go-to restaurant in Barcelona, for dates and dinner with friends alike. The service is fast and very friendly and the food is excellent. The pizza here is better than most I've had in Italy. Dessert is decent, nothing special, but the overall dining experience is top notch.",
