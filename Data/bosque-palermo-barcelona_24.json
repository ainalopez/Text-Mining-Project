    "Amazing paella. I came here due to the reviews on them. I ordered the mixed paella *2 ppl min @ 10 euro each*. It was a mix of seafood and meat. There were plenty of seafood and meat. \u00a0The meat was very tender, it fell right off the bone. It was messy to eat prawns, but the work was worth it. The paella was piping hot when it came out. The only part I didn't like was that it was slightly too salty for my taste, but it is an easy adjustment to tell the waiters.",
