    "Jai-Ca is a great tapas bar in a city that generally doesn't serve great tapas. The prices are fair, the ambiance is fun and the beers are flowing. The coveted outdoor seating is now hit or miss since they have removed a lot of it (sometimes the whole area altogether on weekend nights) due to the constant noise complaints.It's a great spot for some bravas and pescadito tapas though I wouldn't say that their quality is top-notch. It's great for a post-beach snack or just for having some beers with some tapas before heading out.",
