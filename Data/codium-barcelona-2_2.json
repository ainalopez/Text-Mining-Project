    "Spectacular inventive food by a chef who really cares. \u00a0Just got back from two weeks in Spain and France and this was the best of all of our dinners. \u00a0 We're jaded New Yorkers who eat out nearly every night so tend to trust our instincts more than what we read in any guidebooks. \u00a0This place had the chef's name on the menu out front (often a good sign) and an attractive logo. \u00a0It was completely empty (usually a bad sign) so we passed on it but then after a couple of more blocks, turned around and went back. \u00a0 \u00a0It's not a scene but for creative, original preparations of fresh ingredients, a memorable dinner.",
