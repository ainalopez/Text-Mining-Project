    "Jet lag be gone.Loved the vibe here. \u00a0It has a speakeasy feel (quality drinks/bartenders who care about service) but with a lively atmosphere.I was happy to chill at the bar and watch the preparation of drinks. \u00a0The customers were also fascinating. \u00a0The bar is the best place to watch it all go down and Bobby Gin did not dissapoint.I can see this place as an early drink or late night drink kind of place. \u00a0It is too good to be the only bar you do all night. \u00a0Don't overstay your welcome....make it a special stop.I am keeping this place bookmarked for my next trip. \u00a0It was a good memory for me!",
