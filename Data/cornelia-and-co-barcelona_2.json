    "Good semi authentic Catalan food. But be forewarned, the service is one of the most horrible experiences I've had in Barcelona. Ate the Patatas Bravas, BBQ squid and Pan Tomacat which were all great and extremely tasty. If it weren't for the rude waiters and 15 minute wait for water and the check, would've rated higher.",
