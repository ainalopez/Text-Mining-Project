    "Stopped by for lunch. They have some nice bar seating and also spots outdoors. We choose the bar (it was a rainy morning). They serve you a bunch of olives to start while you wait for your food. We ordered a burrata salad that had balsamic, sweet sun dried tomatoes (so good!) and olives on lettuce mix. Then we shared a bacalao fish in spinach and garlic sauce. The piece of fish was a bit small for the price (4 stars) \u00a0but it was perfectly cooked and went really well with the spinach and garlicService was a bit slow but overall nice",
