    "Very chill and relaxing atmosphere indoors. Not a fan of ham but ended up trying their ham and it was pretty good- thinly sliced, tasty, and not salty. The ham pairs well with their peppers. Wine selection was super. You do have an option to sit outside as well. The wine shelves and hanging ham decor was intriguing. Nice place to sit down for wine!",
