    "English menus and friendly staff. Nice clean place with cool decor. Food is amazing and different. Furthermore the prices are very reasonable for what you get. The french toast was amazing and big enough to share as desert. The salads looked awesome but as others have said, go with the other menu items as they're quite different. Eg. Pulled chicken cronut? Highly recommend if your visiting Barcelona and want a good feed.",
