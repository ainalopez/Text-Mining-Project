    "Carrer Blai in Poble Sec is somewhere to get lost. With probably around 30 places serving drinks and pintxos, it is quite difficult to find the right one. It is hard to get a spot on the terraces, so when you get one you mount your barricades there and plan to stay for a while. We got a spot the day of the champions league final and I have the chance to stay with some friends, chatting happily about the match and other issues in live. The menu looks good and we had the chance to taste their chorizo omelette, that I have to say is moist, tender and tasty. The waiters are dressed with this long aprons that gives the place some style. But what I liked more it was the price. It looks is going to be more expensive but no, it is just right.",
