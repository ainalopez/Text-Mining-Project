    "Food is tasty, service is borderline. Ate dinner here our first night in Barcelona. The first waiter was very kind & patient with us. All of his food suggestions turned out to be yummy. His reliever an older man was not as kind. He asked if we were finished with dinner & if we would be interested in dessert. We said no. As we sat at an empty table for 45 min. He never brought us the bill. We did not know we had to request it in order to receive it. Guess the waiter thought he was being funny....",
