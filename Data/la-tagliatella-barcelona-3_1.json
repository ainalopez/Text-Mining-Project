    "I truly wanted something besides tapas in Barcelona and I picked this place. The portions are huge and probably the only place that allows you to take food home. I have tried the papardelli pasta with black truffles and ham. The taste was good but the pasta was brought to the table cold and that was not very appetizing. My friend that lives in Barcelona had pasta carbonara. I have tried it and it was also cold and the sauce was runny, not your typical carbonara.Not a very good experience overall.",
