    "Legit ramen in Barcelona?!I know, I know. \u00a0As an Asian female Yelper, I was skeptical. \u00a0Add that to the fact that my hometown of Los Angeles and my current residence of San Francisco are hubs for amazing ramen, and skeptical doesn't even begin to describe my reaction when my boyfriend suggested we go here for dinner one night. \u00a0Once I was there, though, eating flavorful ramen with melt-in-your-mouth pork slices in a spicy broth turned this skeptic into a believer. \u00a0Yes, there is legit ramen in Barcelona. We even told the Irish owner that it was just as good as the ramen back home in SF. \u00a0And that's the honest truth, Yelpers.",
