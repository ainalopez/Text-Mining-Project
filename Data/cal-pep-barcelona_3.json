    "Don't believe the hype. I'm from San Francisco, so I've been trained well in the art of standing in line for food. I've also been trained to expect food that justifies the wait. We went in with all the special ordering tips and still felt a bit bamboozled. The fried seafood wouldn't win a contest with the worst tourist trap in Fisherman's Wharf. The tuna tartare was pretty darn good, as it is in hundreds of restaurants around the world. I liked the guys working the bar, but I don't see how tapas and omekase go together. I'd rather just pick what I want, which I will do next time, at a different tapas bar with better food.",
