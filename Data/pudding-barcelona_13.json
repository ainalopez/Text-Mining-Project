    "Food : salmon cream cheese sandwich is never a let down! But their other sandwiches were definitely sub par than I expected. Their hot foods looked a lot better though!Drinks : we got the afogato and the Vietnamese coffee shake and both were pretty good. Reasonable potions and not too sweet, which was fantastic. Ambiance : the interior is decorated in an Alice in wonderland esque theme, and the plates too are very cute! Free wifi and books for you to read too. Great place to chill.Service : nice people, but some of the waiters/workers don't actually know the correct prices and types and will provide you with the wrong information. And when you mention something wrong at the end, they will just play dumb, and charge you everything. They dropped a sandwich that I ordered and brought us a different one, and when I mentioned that I wanted the first one that I ordered, they offer d to give us a new sandwich and charge for both. Got super angry but just decided to deal with it.",
