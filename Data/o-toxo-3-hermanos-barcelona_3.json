    "Somehow I always end up in Barcelona. \u00a0Not that I don't like it, I just like to try new places often. \u00a0That said, with a few exceptions I usually don't visit the same eatery there since I'm getting to know the city little by little on each visit.On my second visit, we stumbled across O'toxo. \u00a0Great food, good ambiance, the service was a little slow, but they were very communicative and pleasant. \u00a0I've returned to Spain twice since that first visit and plan to continue to seek out this great little corner spot.",
