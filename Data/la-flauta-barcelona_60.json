    "OK, so I went here in 2006, so my review is totally outdated. However, La Flauta has given me one of my most favorite dining experiences, so I must rave about it. To support my outdated review, I will tell you that I have recommended this place to all friends visiting Barcelona and they have all LOVED it. Most recent person visited last year. So the following rave can't be too outdated.My husband and I came to La Flauta during our honeymoon in October 2006. We had no idea where to eat for dinner one night; but then we saw La Flauta and it looked so good. It was crowded, which is always a good sign. We started off with sangria, of course, which was amazing. Fresh and flavorful; the best sangria we had while in Barcelona. The waiter was so patient with us and helped us interpret the menu and order. We then had tapas, all of which were delicious. The one that most stands out was this perfect piece of filet mignon topped with a perfectly crusted piece of duck. AAAA-MA-ZING.This was our favorite meal during our entire honeymoon, which consisted of various stop in the Mediterranean. It may have been my favorite meal ever in my life.",
