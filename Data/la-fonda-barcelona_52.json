    "We discovered this great restaurant Jan 31th, 2008 by accident and were surprised by every detail: Nice ambiance, friendly and professional service (probably all south-east asian), good food (I heard about the fantastic paella but didn't taste it myself), and very fair, almost cheap, rates. The Creme Catalane by the way is awesome... No reservations possible, so be prepared to wait in line (especially before they open between 20.15 and 20.30, even in January!). It doesn't take long because they have many tables (though it is still comfortable) and they serve efficient (though you feel relaxed during dinner). A good choice is the 17EUR-menu which includes 0,25l wine or water).",
