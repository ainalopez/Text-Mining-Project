    "Excellent find with the help of Yelp. This place attracts tourists without being the typical tourist trap experience. Delicious jamon iberico sampler as appetizer followed by the best tasting lamb chops I have ever had served over your own mini grill at the table. Wine was good and inexpensive. Complimentary cordials after the meal. I definitely would go back.",
