    "Fantastic pizza in Barcelona right off La Ramba. Elegant atmosphere and very clean restaurant. Service is polite, professional but very slow compared to what I'm used to in New York City. But everything in Barcelona is slower and more laid back so can't fault the wait staff for the slow service. I'd definitely return to try other delicous looking food I saw passing by.",
