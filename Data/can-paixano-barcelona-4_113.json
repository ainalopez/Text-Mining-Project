    "LOVE this place! Not sure how we ended up here, but it definitely held up to expectations. It's a hole-in-the-wall where you can order lots of fried tapas and (more importantly) very cheap cava. Very loud, throw your trash on the ground, crowded environment.Perfect, I might add, for a lunch before visiting the Barcelona Exotic Museum :)",
