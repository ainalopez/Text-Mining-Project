    "Woke up a little later, this one opens at 10:00am, an hour later than Milk next door and we decided to try it. Again we were looking to load up on a heavy meal before setting out and ordered the American Breakfast. Fried eggs, bacon, hash brown. Everything was perfect, like an upscale Diner back home. Eggs were large, bacon was crispy, hash brown was also crispy but tender inside, and really flavorful. Top-notch ingredients plus good execution. Prices are also reasonable, less than $15 for a complete meal.",
