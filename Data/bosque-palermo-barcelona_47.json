    "I LOVED THIS PLACE!!! \u00a0I was desperate not to leave Spain without a nights of fabulous Paella and sangria. Now that I have eaten at this restaurant, I can relax and enjoy Barcelona. I will always look back fondly on this meal. Don't expect a super romantic atmosphere. It is pretty down home. It is the food you come here for. Make a reservation. It fills up quickly.",
