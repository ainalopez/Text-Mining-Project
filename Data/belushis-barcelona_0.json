    "This bar is connected to St Christiphers inn, the hostel I was staying at over the weekend. Belushi's offers residents of the hostel 25% discount. I ordered the jack Daniels wings and it was hands down the best wings I've ever had. It was perfectly crisped outside, great flavor, and most moist and tender meat on the inside. The bar stays open till late hours, and the ambience is laid back. Tables are widely spaced in a roomy area, so it's definitely not cramped.",
