    "Very relaxed atmosphere. It looks more a lunch place, although the quality of food is outstanding. We really enjoyed the lamb bbq tacos (with the traditional chickpeas broth on the side) and the ceviche's tostadas...relatively cheap as well, 4 dishes (enough to fill us up), 2 michelladas, a tequila and a premium mezcal for 60\u20ac. Absolutely recommended if you wanna experience REAL Mexican food.",
