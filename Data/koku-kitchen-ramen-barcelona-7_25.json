    "Decent ramen place in Barcelona. I lived in El gotico so this was my go to whenever I wanted some asian food, super convenient! My only vice about this place is that they put kimchi in their ramen.... Also they only give you a half soft boiled egg. You can get it without the kimchi (that's what I always do) and you can also order more egg.It's really hard to give more than 3 stars to a ramen place when you've been to every ramen place in Sawtelle. Wish I was able to compare this to the really popular ramen place out in gracia!",
