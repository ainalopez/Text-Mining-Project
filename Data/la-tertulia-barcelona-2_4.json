    "We've lived in Les Corts for a long time and it's not easy to find a place with such a nice terrace and almost a village feel. \u00a0The food's good and the manager, who's from Uruguay, is excellent, giving great customer service. The steak tartare, the fideua and the paella are all very good. It's a nice place for a relaxing lunch at the weekend. Best to book to get on the terrace. We keep going back!",
