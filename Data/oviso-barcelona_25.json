    "What an AWESOME place to spend our last night in Spain/Barcelona! Recommended from our vacay home hosts as a good lunch/dinner spot, we didn't make it till the end of our trip which was a shame. The bar was dark and buzzing with people - tourists and locals alike, had some tables in the plaza outside which would probably be a nice place to chill on a nice day. Had a little too much beer (which my friend and I quickly learned on our trip is cheaper than water or soda), but the small munchies we had helped keep it sane. The staff was super friendly -we ended up chatting up with the the charming manager, Eric who made us feel very welcome! It's too bad we couldn't spend more time there during our stay. Will be back to Oviso if somehow I end up back in Barcelona!",
