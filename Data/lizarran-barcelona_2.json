    "We made a last minute decision to stop here while sightseeing in Barcelona. \u00a0 The place has a great, upbeat vibe. \u00a0The hardest part about coming here is deciding on which pinchos to have and convincing yourself to stop. \u00a0We counted a whopping 25 pinchos between by husband and I and they were all amazing. \u00a0Sit near the kitchen so you have first dibs when that bell rings, as they usually don't make it to the pincho bar. \u00a0Ca\u00f1as were perfect. \u00a0One month later, we are still talking about. \u00a0A must-visit for a quick, inexpensive lunch in Barcelona, but be warned, once you start, you can't stop!",
