    "I saw some mixed reviews on TripAdvisor but really glad Yelp helped seal the deal on visiting this place. There is a new owner who bought the restaurant and is in the process of changing the name from Ramen Can to Samurai Ramen. He was very friendly and approachable; he speaks Japanese, Spanish, and English pretty fluently, so many people will be comfortable communicating here. Brought the Wi-Fi info to us without us even asking, just in case we wanted to use it. (We did!)They have several nice vegetarian options; we had the vegetarian ramen and a vegetarian curry udon, both of which were great. We asked them to add tofu, which they did, but it wasn't very much. Not a big problem, but if you are looking for a significant amount, you may want to ask them for extra.I also ordered a spicy tuna roll for 5 euro, expecting the typical boring maki I am used to in the USA. However they had a way more creative presentation; the role had more of a spicy bite to it and there were crispy onions on the outside. And, most notably, the tuna was cooked! If you are all about the raw fish then you may not appreciate that as much, but personally I thought it worked really well as a whole and really enjoyed it. I did ask the owner about it and he said they don't use raw fish and they don't use fried fish; I wasn't fully clear on whether that applies to ALL of the fish or just this one item. If it's a big deal to you, ask first. Personally, my advice is just to let them make it the way they normally make it, since it was delicious!",
