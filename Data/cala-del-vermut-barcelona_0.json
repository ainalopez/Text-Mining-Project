    "Luv. Just settle in and go up to the counter and pick your food. Olives? yum. Peppers? Oh heck yes. Great little spot with wonderful coziness I was here a few times just to eat drink and read. Always felt welcomed. The only disturbance was a tour grolup who seemed to need someone to tell them what they should order. IMHO don't do that. Just do your own thing and realax..Bravo!",
