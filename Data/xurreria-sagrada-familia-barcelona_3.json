    "While backpacking through europe I was determined to eat all the delicious food I could possibly fit in my body. I was looking online for churros and discovered this place was minutes away from the Sagrada Familia church which I has a scheduled tour of in the morning. Seems like destiny if you ask me. I walked over there and orders the cream filled churro and the dulce de Leche filled churro. Honestly the best churros I have ever had in my life. They were massive and the filling was divine. \u00a0I preferred the cream filling because it was nice and light buy if you love dulce de Leche trust me when I say they do not skimp out. \u00a0Definitely worth a try!",
