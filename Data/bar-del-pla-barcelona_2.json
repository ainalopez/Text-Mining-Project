    "Usually when we travel Rick Steves tells my wife where it is we should eat at, and she in turn tells me. \u00a0Not this time. \u00a0I deserve all the credit for scoring this second-to-none hang out spot.Without Rick Steves' incredible power to summon tourists from every part of the world at hand, \u00a0no surprises then that we were the only tourists in the bar, with pairs and trios of other local parties slurping down \"angry snails\" over conversation after poking them each out of their shell with some kind of wooden prodding instrument. \u00a0It looked fun and maybe tasty, but allowing me to pick the place to eat was the extent of the adventure my wife was up for this day. \u00a0She couldn't handle me scarfing down slimy yard critters at the same table she'd order a turkey sandwich, or something similarly boring for Spain.Nothing boring to report from me when I went straight to the steak tartare; raw ground beef with black truffle oil, foie gras and served with a crispy, fried potato-like vehicle for transport to your mouth. \u00a0I know, it's a pretty scary thought for us Americans to brave raw meat of any kind, especially beef. \u00a0But contracting Mad Cow Disease after eating this dish is a fair trade.Hint: \u00a0You should go to this bar.",
