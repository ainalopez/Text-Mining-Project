    "We had a great first night at this restaurant, so we decided to go back for our last night in Barcelona. Unfortunately, our experience was not as perfect as the first time. We went for dinner around 7:30, and I don't know if it was too early for the dinner rush, but many of the dishes we had were somewhat cold and clearly not made fresh at the time. We experienced this with the meatballs, mussels, and razor clams - all of which we had the other night and really enjoyed. We sent two of the dishes back. Perhaps it was an off night for them, but as a result I'd lower our over all rating of the place from 5 stars to 3 stars.",
