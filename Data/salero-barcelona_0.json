    "Hip restaurant in Born. The restaurant does not only attract a fancy crowd but also is fancy itself. The decoration is a mixture of old and new with a focus on lighting that brings about a chilled atmosphere all based on the colour white. The prices for dinner are more expensive than other places in this area but still not really expensive. I heard that especially during lunch time however, they are more on the cheap side. The food on offer of the small menu is barely comprehensible even if you are capable of castellan, this is because of the international dishes that are, I guess, mostly named in foreign languages. If you go there at night make sure to book a table as this place rarely has free tables. The downside to this is that they have two rounds at night. So you can either book a table early (around 21:00) or very late (around 23:30). Plus, it is a bit noisy inside because of the people chatting away, however not to noisy that you could not have a normal conversation at your table. The service depends pretty much on your luck. In our case it took them more than half an hour before we could order, but after we ordered everything came pretty fast, maybe a little too fast. All in all, definitely a recommendable place for friends and young families and a night out with your partner.",
