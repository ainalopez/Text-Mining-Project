    "I was craving Korean food while visiting Spain and gave into going for one korean meal during my visit to Barcelona. \u00a0This restaurant hours are very weird. \u00a0I first went by the website hours and they had closed early for lunch hrs. \u00a0I then went back for dinner time thinking they were going to be open for sure and they were closed again w/o any signs explaining against their posted business hrs. \u00a0Be sure to call before heading out to this restaurant and speak to a person to confirm the hours.",
