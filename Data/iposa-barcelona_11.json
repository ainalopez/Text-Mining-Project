    "Perfect spot for lunch; three-option special menu changes daily and includes soup, drink, and entree for cheap. Food is fresh, tasty, and interesting. They seem to always have alternative options too (vegetarian, gluten free, raw). My party of three got one of each, then shared them all. We came back the next day too.The host speaks English if you're a jerk and don't speak Spanish. He might be a jerk right back at you though.I'll definitely be back.",
