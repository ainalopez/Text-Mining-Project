    "After spending a few days in San Sebastian, then traveling to Barcelona, Sagardi was a pleasant reminder of the delicious pintxo bars of the Basque Country. \u00a0We had just finished a bicycle tour through Fat Tire and had out run a rain storm when our guide took us to this tasty spot. \u00a0If you are not familiar with pintxos bars, they are self serve. \u00a0You request a plate from the bartender and choose from the array of treats situated across the bar. \u00a0Nothing is labeled, but if you ask the bartenders, they speak English well enough to explain what each one is. \u00a0Otherwise, just enjoy the gastronomic adventure. \u00a0Each pintxos has a tooth pick through it so that the bartender can tally up your bill. \u00a0As previous reviewers have noted, it's standing room only inside, but they do have seats outside for a higher price. \u00a0 It's definitely a fun place and with some interesting bites.",
