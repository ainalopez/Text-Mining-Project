    "This is a traditional restaurant that got too big because of the story behind the star dish \"Roasted Suckling Lamb\" and because of the great taste of it.Everything else is normal. And service is below normal, except for the manager, she is super nice, she answered all our questions about the history of the restaurant and the place.But the waiter was \"rough\", he doesn't speak English, he would put all the drinks in the middle and expects you distribute it (we were a large group), he would bring the side dishes for the lamb with the appetizers.But the Lamb is still very good, and you must try it, this is why I am giving it four starts. It is one of those restaurants that you have to go there at least once.",
