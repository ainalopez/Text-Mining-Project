    "7 Portes was a completely unexpected surprise! \u00a0I love places that have a history and this restaurant definitely has this! \u00a0The food was amazing and the wine selections were incredible. \u00a0The service was just wonderful. \u00a0The atmosphere is definitely more family-style, so not as intimate if you are looking for a place to take a date.",
