    "The reviews and photos made this place seem like a unique sushi experience, but it was one of the worst dining experiences I had in Barcelona. \u00a0Once seated, it took 20 minutes for anyone to take my order. \u00a0I even tried to flag them down several times.The menu seemed interesting, but everything I ordered was bland or underwhelming. \u00a0The sashimi wasn't anything special, and definitely not worth the price.Ordered Edamame and Hot Sake with the meal, and they both came 15 minutes after I was done with he Sushi.The music was really clubby and not great for the otherwise beautiful decor.",
