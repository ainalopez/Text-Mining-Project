    "This used to be my local when I lived up in Gracia but I haven\u00b4t been for awhile since no longer live nearby. I went back to this weekend and found it exactly as I remembered it: great ambiance, really nice staff and delicious mojitos (I went for \"just one\" and ended up having four....oops). The bar is cute and cozy, decorated with old antiques and some cool art pieces. It has a friendly, welcoming vibe and both clients as well as the staff seemed to be having a good time. There are games that you can play which make the atmosphere even better, and the music was awesome. The waitress was super friendly made sure that our table was always attended to and although I arrived late and didn\u00b4t eat my friends all said that the food was delicious (their bravas and nachos are always a favorite). The menu has a nice mix of choices, a lot of which are veggie options which is usually pretty hard to find.This bar is definitely top on the list of Gracia bars and I was very happy to see that it\u00b4s just as great I remembered it. I\u00b4ll be back for sure.",
