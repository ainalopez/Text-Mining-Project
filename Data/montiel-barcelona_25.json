    "Truly as good as it gets. \u00a0I had the wine pairing and it was perfect. \u00a0In this country Cava usually is a garbage sweet throwaway. \u00a0Here it's amazing. \u00a0My wife has a limited diet (fish and vegetables). \u00a0Not only did they accommodate they replaced the choices with masterpieces that were as good as the original selections which I enjoyed. \u00a0The service couldn't be better. \u00a0The information on the wine choices was spot on. \u00a0Don't miss it if you go to Barcelona.",
