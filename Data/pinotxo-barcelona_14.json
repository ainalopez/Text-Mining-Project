    "I'm still drooling about the food from here.The sign looks fun and light but the food is serious. Don't-mess-with-us serious. Pinotxo served some of the best tapas I've had in Barcelona, no Spain.I thought I didn't like beans but whatever animal fat they cooked the navy beans made me want to lick the plate clean. Perfect with baby squid. There is no menu, so once you are seated, one of the servers came around to offer you options. We basically pointed to what we saw other people eating and asked for food items we liked.Much of the food was a wonderful surprise.My favorites was the razor clams and the beef cheek stew. The razor clams were steamed in their own juices with white wine. It was sweet, briny and so fresh. The beef cheek was tender; the chunks of seared and chewy beef with suet intermingling with bay leaves and other spices. You could only eat so much because you would get fat saturated but each bite was heavenly. I wish we stayed closer to The Market so we could have frequented Pinotxo a couple more times before leaving!",
