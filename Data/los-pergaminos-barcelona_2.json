    "It was sunny in Barcelona today, that was the only reason to explain why we were the only ones in this restaurant for lunch. \u00a0Excellent food and service. We had pulpo de la plantza for appetizer while our mixto paella was prepared. Tender octopus on a bed of potatoes with truffles, most delicious with local vino blanco. Paella was exquisite but we had to take half of it home to make room for dessert. Had passion fruit/lemon mouse over a crushed cookie base with nuts and butter. Nice finish with cafe con leche. Can't wait to try their dinner tapas.",
