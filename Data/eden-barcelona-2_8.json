    "Found this on yelp as I'm on holidays in Barcelona and i didn't know where to eat. It was about a kilometre from my apartment and the walk was worth it.We went in under the little door and we were greeted by a man who asked us where would we like to sit. We sat outside and we ordered. We got a pizza and the carbonara. Both were delicious! The pizza wasn't dry or greasy, perfect amount of sauce!We really enjoyed our meal, service was very kind and had great English. Would highly recommend.",
