    "LOVE LOVE LOVE Pinotxo,we got here on our first day in barcelona, and we headed there early as i knew it would get crowded. i got a seat right in front of the owner and was a little intimidated as i spoke very limited spanish and he didnt seem to speak any english (plus he was extremely busy taking orders, being the only barista, and also pseudo mayor of the town as every passer was shaking his hand). anyway, he looked at us with a big warm smile, and that was it, we were hooked. he was the best service in town and thats why people adore this place.now, the food. we had stewed beef, and Griddled fish. the fish for me was incredible, its so fresh that you can literally taste the ocean. but the highlight for us was the racones. i can only describe it as sugar coated-cylindrical shaped croissant filled with cream. and it really is to die for! i can literally fly all the way back to barcelona, just to have that and coffee made by the owner.come to pinotxo immediately when you arrive in barcelona. your barcelona experience will be off to a great start with a meal from here.",
