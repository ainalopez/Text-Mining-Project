    "Our last night in Barcelona & we wanted to sit at a normal restaurant this place was recommended earlier in the day.Nice place looking at it from the outside u would never know it is so big. We came in with a group of six & had no trouble being seated once settled most of us drank (1) Sangria not bad a bit on the sweet size others had a glass of (2) Red wine this was good. On the food lets begin with \u00a0(3) Mini macaroni & egg salad , this was delicious great tasting never tried a Salad like this. Another salad choice was the (4) Goat cheese salad also very good (5) The Selection of BBQ meats & cheese nice meat & pretty good cheese (6) Bread with sauce , not bad (7) Vegetable cannelloni good (8) Mussels Macaroni good as well Next up the home made (9) Osana beef burger w mushrooms was good. Followed by the (10) Premium Beef Steak & (11) Osabuko was ok (12) Grilled Cod fish wasn't bad a bit salty & finally the (13) Osana Beef steak with fries this was really good nice juice steak comes with an amazing garlic sauce great for the steak & perfect for dipping the fries as well which had a great potato taste to them. \u00a0At the end there was little room for dessert but we managed to try a (13) Fried Fritter \u00a0which wasn't that great & finally a (14) Flan this was way better. Good service & decent prices we enjoyed a good meal. It turned out to be a good place to sit , relax , eat , drink & enjoyed good company amongst friends.",
