    "38\u20ac for impersonal service and three dishes. We went to pinotxo after because we had a much better meal there the day before for less and they had even more people sitting there. I would not recommend this place. Ever. Super ImPersonal. They throw an English menu with pencil at you, purposely ignore you til you ask for the check, and no smiles. Ick Malo Malo.",
