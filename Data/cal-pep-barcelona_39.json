    "Best meal in Barcelona. \u00a0After 9+ meals of Spanish tapas, thought I was over it... But this place (last meal in the city) was amazing!! \u00a0Expect at least a 30 min wait, but feel free to order drinks while standing in line. \u00a0When it's time to order, there is no menu- but let the waiter take care of you. Fish? Yes. Meat? Yes. \u00a0Definitely get the clams. The monk fish and the steak are delicious. And end the meal with a glass of vermouth and espresso. Yum!!",
