    "The menu del dia is good. Very very generous portions, and many included courses that you don't see on the menu. I got the 10 euro menu (11 with IVA included), and was started off with some caldo in a glass, olives, and a big racion of pan con tomate for the table. I got the calamares a la romana (calamari rings) for my first plate and the seafood paella for my second, fearing that I wouldn't get enough seafood....Boy was I wrong. I was pretty much full by the end of my first plate. I never thought I'd get full off squid, but that goes to show how generous the portion was. My seafood paella was also chock-full of seafood, from shrimp to mussels to squid! I was glad I went with people because I wouldn't be able to finish this menu off by myself.A dessert is also included, but these were in my opinion, very disappointing. Pre-packaged ice cream, canned pineapple, an apple, or a 'mousse' that is 60% dry cake...still, after dessert they follow up with a 'chupito' of barely alcoholic fruity liqueur and some sort of honey cake. A good way to end it. Drinks are included, and service is friendly. Really good prices for what's being served; right by the beach, really a place you can take people when they visit BCN!",
