    "Have an open mind this is a culinary carnival of flavors provided in the form of one-bite tapas! However if you are very hungry this may not be the place for you...tonight that is because here it is all about tasting and don't get me wrong it is pricey! Some things are good and some thing are eh tell your waiter what you like and let them surprise you although after my experience you may want to give a ballpark of what you want to spend per person. It is a mad scientists laboratory of molecular food concoctions from olives that burst in your mouth to mushroom spaghetti (my favorite) what you see might not be what you are eating ...cauliflower cous cous, gazpacho made with jelly, powdered vinegar ... The list goes on take a chance and book a ticket to ride....",
