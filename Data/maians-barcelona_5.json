    "A great find in barcelonetta! Such a nice little neighborhood and this was the perfect spot. All the tapas are super fresh, including the mussels and fresh caught fish. On top of all that the server was very helpful and the food was much cheaper than other overpriced Barcelona neighborhoods! If you want tapas, go to the beach, get some sangria, and show up here around 8/830. You won't be disappointed.",
