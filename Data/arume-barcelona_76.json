    "My fiancee and I decided to celebrate our recent engagement at Arume and they provided an excellent experience that we'll always remember. Even though they were booked beyond 9pm, the manager Eduardo allowed us to stay as late as we'd like to eat and celebrate. The service was great (the servers were attentive, quick, and friendly) and the atmosphere is romantic and casual. Eduardo was very generous and kind, and came by to ask about our story and thank us for choosing his restaurant for our celebratory dinner. Now, the food...simply incredible! We had the chorizo tacos (as other Yelpers mentioned, these were great), the paella (best in Barcelona!), and various appetizers/starters that was recommended by Eduardo. We had the cookie/violet ice cream dessert and it was really interesting and delicious (never had violet ice cream before, but it was amazing). There were lots of great cava, champagne, and wine options. Of course we went for a bottle of the house champagne and it did not disappoint. The price was very good as well - a dinner for two including various appetizers, mains, dessert, and a bottle of champagne came out to 100 euros total. In conclusion, I highly recommend this restaurant for your next dinner in Barcelona.",
