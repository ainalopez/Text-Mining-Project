    "Really cute little place in the historical center of Barcelona. Has great brunch which is apparently not so common in the city. We had pancakes, muesli with fresh fruits & bagels. Everything was tasty. If you don't want to wait in line for too long, just give your name at the waitress, she will put your name on the waiting list.",
