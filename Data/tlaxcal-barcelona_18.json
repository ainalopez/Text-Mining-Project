    "It was great to find another Mexican restaurant in Barcelona that wasn't Tex-mex, but actually mexican food made by mexican people. \u00a0Being in a touristy neighborhood, I was a bit skeptical of the food, but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very kind and the owner talked with us a bit. \u00a0She made some recommendations which we thoroughly enjoyed. \u00a0We started with Nachos and a side of Guacamole. \u00a0The nachos had refried beans on them and tons of cheese. \u00a0I probably could have called it a night after that, but there's nothing like being sick from eating too much mexican food, so we soldiered on. My wife ordered the tacos de suadero and I had the enchiladas verde. \u00a0Both were exceptional and delicious. \u00a0The plates are presented beautifully and the food is very simply done. \u00a0They also have a very spicy salsa which I unfortunately had on my finger when I tried to wipe sweat from my eye. \u00a0Very effective stuff. \u00a0If you're in the Born and want good Mexican food, this is the place to go. \u00a0I know there are other options in the neighborhood so you have to resist and give this one a shot. \u00a0Go authentic.",
