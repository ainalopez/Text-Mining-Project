    "This place was hard to find, the clue is Jerusalem Street, and it's about 2 blocks west of Las Ramblas. \u00a0Fantastically they are in full service even though a building is being put up around them. \u00a0You want to know how fresh their food is? \u00a0They told me I couldn't have a certain fish because the market had just closed and it couldn't be obtained. \u00a0Wow! That's dedication to fresh ingredients! \u00a0I started off with their fish soup which was so delicious it almost sent me into sexual ecstasy, ha ha, or maybe that was the red wine! \u00a0My main course was spaghetti with mussels. \u00a0Everything was delicious and fresh, couldn't ask for better. \u00a0I miss them already!",
