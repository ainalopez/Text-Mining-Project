    "We went there two nights one for tapas and one for dinner. The dinner was excellent, service excellent. The waiter (in English) told us about the meal and told us to share the main course as it was on the large size. Wine good. The Manager was fantastic, hard working and kept the place working in a smooth operation. Recommend you go there. The tapas bar was hectic the night we went. But food was good.",
