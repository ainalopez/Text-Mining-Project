    "After being in Spain for a week, we needed something besides tapas or bocadillos. We needed a taste of HOME--and for us, home is Texas. We were skeptical to try Mexican food in Barcelona, but wow, El Pachuco is good! The margaritas were made with good tequila, Grand Marnier, and fresh lime juice--a simple recipe that most places in the United States take for granted. The guacamole and salsa was oh so fresh and tasty--and on the house from Fernando--such a nice touch. The Nahos Pechuco were simply delicious. We could have stopped there but curiosity won out and we had the carnitas tacos. Again, fresh and delicious. Well done El Pechuco!",
