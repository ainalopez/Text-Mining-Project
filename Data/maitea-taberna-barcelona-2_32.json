    "Really great, affordable tapas (less than 2 euros each), but some of the restaurant staff was kind of rude (mostly the bar woman), and the wait was about an hour even though we were always \"the next table\". We saw a ton of people walk in in the meantime and find seats - maybe they were all at a bar though, but it was a really long hour standing around to get seated in a place that didn't seem all that busy.The tapas were fantastic, however, and the total bill for 4 with drinks was only \u20ac90.",
