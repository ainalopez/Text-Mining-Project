    "Great Paella, however it's my first dish in Barcelona so I have nothing to compare it to. I couldn't image it tasting any better, the seafood was fresh and was cooked perfectly. I attempted to speak Spanish then the waitress started to speak English so ordering was easy. Free fast wifi. As I paid my bill we took shots together to top off a great experience in Barcelona.",
