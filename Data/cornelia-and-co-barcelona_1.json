    "It doesn't get any cuter and more hipster than this. Cornelia & Co is an adorably chic restaurant meets cafe meets picnic shop in Barcelona's gorgeous Eixample neighborhood. I had the charcoal grilled Galician octopus. Served on a bed on potatoes and liberally sprinkled with pimenton, this was some of the best octopus I've ever had. I enjoyed a salad here too, but the octopus stole the show. Service is friendly and pretty quick, though I came here during post-lunch and pre-dinner hours, so they weren't very busy.",
