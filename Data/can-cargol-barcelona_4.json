    "The owner, though with a grumpy face, was nice enough to accept us at 11pm on a Sunday if we promised to be quick. Hunger overpowered all else so we said 'yes!' Luckily our attendant was a very sweet person. He showed us the Catalan way of eating pa amb tomaquet in quite an entertaining way. They had run out of almost all but the entrecote and the Catalan sausage (botifarra). The food was average but we loved the service and the cute and cozy decoration.",
