    "The quirky decor and the cheap mojito offer (3,5 Euro) \u00a0dragged me to this place while passing by. At \u00a0first sight, I didn't realize it is a Vietnamese restaurant. \u00a0It took some time to discover what is beneath the heavy, colorful make up of the place. When I did figure out , I tried the deep fried wonton filled with vegetables served with a sweet chilli sauce. The sauce was just like the one I had from the Chinese stores here. The fried wonton is a fried food basically, nothing amazing about it. Oh, there was one leaf of lettuce that was placed to make the plate look assorted. The waitress seemed to be annoyed when I told her to give us a moment to think what to order. It is almost like this in any Spanish bar/cafe, you know, the notion of customer service doesn't exist.On top of that, the more people came to the place, the more the air got stuffy. We figured \u00a0the kitchen was near and all the smell was coming straight to where we dine. Two British guys sitting next to our table took their sweaters off complaining about the same stuff. We left the place to move on somewhere more comfortable before we get roasted.",
