    "Huge disappointment!... My friend kept telling me how good this place is, and after La Coronela closed about two years ago we have not had decent Mexican food in Barcelona. So this place is small and you need a reservation. The place was so obnoxiously loud that I had to go outside and wait for my food. I could not bare to be inside with the loud chatter, and I measured the decibels on my iPhone. It got up to 101, which causes damage to the ears after 15 minutes of exposure... I will let you (the reader) look at a common decibel chart. The food took FOOOREVER to arrive! Tacos al pastor took 35 minutes to get to my table after I ordered. The tortillas were dried out and crumbled a bit, yes crumbled (yuck). The nopales were okay. Honestly, I thought it was just mediocre at best. But hey, I lived in Mexico City so I am picky. I prefer the place next door called \"La Cantinita\" (or something like that). But I really wish La Coronela would make a come back :-(",
