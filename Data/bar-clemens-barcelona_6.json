    "The best meal we had in Barcelona and possibly the freshest seafood we had ever eaten anywhere. \u00a0A busy back corner bar that displays there dishes on top of the counters of the bars and you order from the menu or by pointing to what you want. \u00a0Everything was delicious especially the mixed seafood grill. \u00a0We also tried the grilled vegetables and fried sardines. \u00a0The barman was helpful and friendly and the entire bar of patrons was having a great time enjoying the amazing food. \u00a0They even topped our beers off with more foam to enhance taste.We would definitely return to Barcelona and make Bar Clemens one of our first dining stops.",
