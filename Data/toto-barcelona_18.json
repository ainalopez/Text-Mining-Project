    "Good food, bad experience with waiter and bartender - went to bar to pick up beer - bartender offered me some to taste, which was nice but then told me, that he will bring beer to the table - never happened. We got out main course - waiter was not interested in asking why I don't have my drink in front of me (water ordered never showed up either), or even checking later, if everything is ok. Once we paid, we had to ask twice for change - overall service sucked and food not as good to make up the difference...",
