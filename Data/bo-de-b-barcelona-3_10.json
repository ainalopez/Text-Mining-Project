    "Loved everything about this place! Quick service, delicious food, and a great atmosphere for travelers. Very American-friendly. Order the steak tzitiki and it was great! Sort of like a burrito-sandwich type of thing. I could feel the Barcelona vibe emanating from here and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quick bite!",
