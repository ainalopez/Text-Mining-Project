    "It's my first time in this restaurant after my 3rd visit to Barcelona, I found this when googling the good local eats for fresh seafood. We saw people lining up outside to get it when we arrived, fortunately it didn't take long to get it becoz it's spacious inside with good table turn around time. Since there are different ways to cook the seafood that you can request, you may have the food pictures ready in hand to show them when ordering, that helps to communication on top of either English or Spanish. We went twice during our 1 week stay, it's delicious!!",
