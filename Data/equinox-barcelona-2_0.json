    "I have tried many different Lebanese restaurants and shawarma places, and this one is the best that I've found by far. It's a great place to go if you want a casual relaxing delicious meal that is not too expensive. It's right on Carrer Verdi, so that makes it at the center of a beautiful pedestrian street with crepe and ice cream places near by. Completely and totally recommend it. Also, try their baklava, it is so good.",
