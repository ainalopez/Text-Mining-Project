    "My husband & I liked this restaurant so much we came back for lunch after our first visit for dinner. \u00a0Both times we sat at the tapas bar as we didn't have reservations, but the food was definitely worth waiting for a spot at the bar.The fried artichokes were one of the main draws in getting us back for lunch again. \u00a0very lightly fried vs. other places we ate in Spain. \u00a0Other favorites were the fried baby squid, the grilled veggies and the the tuna tartare. \u00a0The tomato bread was yummy too. \u00a0The other seafood tapas and entrees looked fabulous too.Service was very welcoming & sweet. \u00a0We both commented on the great staff that hustled & bustled around the restaurant making sure everyone felt attended to at tables and at the busy tapas bar (two sides.)Most of the patrons appeared to be locals, but the news on this great spot is definitely out in most of the guidebooks too. I noticed several Americans and English.",
