    "**tourist trap warning**Should have known when I looked at the decidedly non-Spanish menu...If you are visiting Barcelona and not seeking a full meal of traditional tapas (don't be ashamed if not, not everyone is dying for squid and sardines, I'm not even sure I am) then this place would be fine -- though I would make sure the pimientos padron are on your menu and I would steer clear of any meat dishes, which were badly overcooked. The waiter chose the dishes for us (which is how they recommend you do it) and our second course was cheese ravioli with artificial white truffle oil on top. Our third dish was eggplant with mozzarella, not well seasoned. It felt a bit insulting to our intelligence, though many other customers seemed to be enjoying themselves.Waiter was not Spanish (and slightly rude) and every customer was clearly not local. Having said that, if you are seeking something reminiscent of a middle of the road pan-Mediterranean spot from your hometown in the U.S., this will be about the same.Yelp's good reviews brought us here, but I should have heeded all of the warning signs...",
