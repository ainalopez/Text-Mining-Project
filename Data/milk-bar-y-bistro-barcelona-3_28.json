    "Amazing brunch in the Gothic quaters. We came here 2 days in a row for brunch. We got the huevos rancheros, perfect blend of 2 eggs, beans, salsa and chips. Do ask for the special course menu which serves 3 courses and is really inexpensive. You get a drink, main course and a hot drink for about 8-10 euros. Service is warm, friendly and efficient!",
