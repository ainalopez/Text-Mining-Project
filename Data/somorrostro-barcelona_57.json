    "Cosy, non-smoking restaurant with an open kitchen and really friendly English speaking staff in Barceloneta. The menu varies every day and therefore the ingredients are always very fresh. The menu includes classic Spanish tapas as well as Asian dishes or once I've spotted kangaroo on the menu depending on what was available on the market that day. This is also the downside as I've had an unbelievably great entrec\u00f4te and another time the entrec\u00f4te was the only thing I was unhappy with. I also have to mention the great olives they serve. It's not cheap but worth it because the orders pile up on the bill as you can sit there for hours sipping wine and chatting, maybe having another carachillo or so.",
