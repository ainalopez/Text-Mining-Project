    "Pros- prefix menu comes with a first and second course, dessert, and drink of choice (beer and wine incl.). Really good value for 19.5 euros. - generous portions- elegant setting, clean toilets- English speaking staff- good locationCons- carb dishes are good (spaghetti, mash potatoes), but the mains are lackluster",
