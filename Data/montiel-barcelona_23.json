    "We have been in Barcelona for nearly two months now and have eaten in many restaurants. \u00a0Montiel is the best overall experience we have had: \u00a0food, ambience, and service were all first class.Montiel is tucked away in a quiet street on the square behind the Museu Picasso. \u00a0Very small, intimate and tastefully decorated. \u00a0We chose the 7 course tasting menu with the wine pairings. \u00a0I'm usually not a big fan of wine pairings but, in this case, it was fabulous. \u00a0The sommelier was knowledgeable and very informative and the wines, mainly Catalan, were very interesting. \u00a0All of the 7 courses were wonderful. \u00a0I particularly liked the favorful red mullet and the wine paired with it (that I can't recall). \u00a0There was also an interesting beet dish as well as tuna tartare.Montiel is not cheap but, for a special dinner, it is the place to go.",
