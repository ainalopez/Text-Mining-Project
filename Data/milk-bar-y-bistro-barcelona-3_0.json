    "Get the fries with aioli.(Maybe with one of their amazing burgers.)Get the fajitas. Fajitas are ok to split so get both. Didn't try the burger. That made me sad. \u00a0We were on a gastro crawl but wish we could just stay here and crawl all over their menu. Laid back wait and bar staff that's perfect. No pressure - they are happy if you just come in and eat a little. And the cafe con leche is at a whole nother level from every cafe con leche I've had since coming to Spain. You will wish you lived in Barcelona. For those of you who do. Vds. tienen muy buena fortuna.",
