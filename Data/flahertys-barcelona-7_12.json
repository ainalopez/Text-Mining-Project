    "Sad to say, our home base while in Barcelona was an Irish Pub. We spent our first night in town here watching the FC Barcelona/Man U championship game back in May. The place was packed even at 2pm in the afternoon ( for a 6pm game). Tables were already reserved but luckily, the awesome manager Tatyana gave us a high table with two chairs eventhough they weren't planning on allowing chairs there. We ate a great pub meal of quesadillas and fries ( ok, maybe not typical Irish fare but it was great typical pub food). The crowd was fantastic and exciting as we experienced our first international futbol game. We felt like outsiders watching the Phils win the World Series. The only downer was that my purse was taken as it sat right night to me. Luckily, despite not seeing what he looked like as he fled through the crowd, \u00a0I still \u00a0tracked the guy outside who stood there like an idiot with a backback thinking this stupid American wouldn't persue him. I did, and with the help of the bouncer, got my purse back and proceeded to enjoy the rest of the night at Flahertys. The staff \u00a0is the best and the reason why we would stop in every night for a drink. Eddie, Tatyana, Nikki- all awesome people! Friendly, provide great service and fun to hang out with.If you're looking for a break from all the Spanish culture ( not that it's not wonderful, because it is)- Stop in here and grab one of the many beers they have on tap and strike up a conversation with the stellar staff.",
