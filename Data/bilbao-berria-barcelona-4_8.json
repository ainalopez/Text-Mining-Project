    "The paella was slimy. \u00a0The crab tapas was a little crusty because it was covered in mayonnaise and was sitting out a little too long. \u00a0The tomato/prosciutto/egg/caviar tapas was too salty to even eat. \u00a0The house wine is good and the ambience is nice, so stop in here for a quick drink, but do yourself a favor and skip the tapas. \u00a0Other places are much better, and this place isn't so cheap once you start adding everything up. \u00a0Pass!!",
