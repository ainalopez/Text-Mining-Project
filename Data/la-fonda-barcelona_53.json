    "My wife found this restaurant recommended by a local guide for Japanese. And since its famous for its Paella we had to try it! The place has 2 floors and we went up ;) Had to wait 20 minutes for or 2 person fish-paella, but that we have been told when we ordered. Meanwhile we drunk some of the houses white wineand than the paella came. Help, with full size scrimps (how to eat them without making a mess?). Taste was fine, but somehow not as good as we expected. This is a fine restaurant near the La Ramba (but a little hard to find if you don`t know where). Friendly stuff.",
