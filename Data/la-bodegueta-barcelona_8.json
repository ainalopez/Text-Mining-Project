    "This place Sucks with big letter \"S\". Service is non existent and preferential to locals. Whatever they call \"tapas\" is very cheap pre-cooked food sold at close to meal prices. It's seems it's all about location and beer, which makes people come there. If you are going for food, go the other way.",
