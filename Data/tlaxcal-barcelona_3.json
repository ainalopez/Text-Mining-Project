    "I loooooooooove Mexican food!to the point of thinking about going to a Mexican Restaurant while in a food heaven such Spain.This place is nicely done in a big Spain and is full of references to mexico but avoiding all the uber-used cliches. It's is located in a side street of mercado del Borne in a big space.We shared some nachos and quesadillas to start and quite frankly there weren't anything exceptional. The totopos or tortillas weren't home made which is something a place serving authentic Mexican food should always do. Then we ordered several orders of tacos and \u00a0they were ok a bit too salty in my opinion.The overall experience didn't go very well so I think the only thing to do here is give them another shot in the future!!",
