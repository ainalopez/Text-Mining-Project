    "So good, I don't know where to start... All aspects of this little Taco joint we're amazing...First off, I knew we were on to something when we found it located on a tiny street with no one heckling you to come in and eat. So often, it's the places off the beaten track that are the best. Now, let's talk food and drinks... We were four and were just too lazy to read the menu so we asked the server to just bring us a feast... That's exactly what he did. One plate after another of very enjoyable, non-typical Mexican cuisine arrived at out table. It was an amazing way to go.I could go on and on, but think it's better for you to have your own experience. Enjoy!",
