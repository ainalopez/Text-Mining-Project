    "What a surprise, really... I'm impressed. Completely hidden in the middle of Paseo de Gracia, El Nacional is a mix of options for all occasions. From cocktails, Brasseries, Tapas, Desserts, Mediterranean food, this place can really make your day. This is my first time and for sure I'll be coming back from now on.",
