    "We cane here at recommendation of our hotel. First, everyone sits in the \"basement\" so you won't see anyone sitting from the outside. \u00a0Second, their salad is excellent. \u00a0 Best we had in the city. Next was paella which was very good. \u00a0I asked for some Spanish wine and what they provided was very good. \u00a0They gave two free servings of a liqueur which was nice! \u00a0 Would go there again.",
