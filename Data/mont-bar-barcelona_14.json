    "The meal started out great. Outstanding olives and bread were delivered to the table as I just sat down. The olives were among the best I've ever had. \u00a0I started with the house made burrata which was very good. \u00a0I then had the smoked tuna belly that everyone raves about. It was OK, but not necessarily worth 20 Euros. I was still a bit hungry so I ordered the soup special of the day - cream of cauliflower with caviar on top. \u00a0I guess I should have asked the price before ordering - I get the bill and the price of the soup was 40 euros - as much as the entire meal. Note to staff - please post the specials on a blackboard w/ the price, so guests aren't offended when the bill comes.",
