    "the best food that i have tried in Barcelona so far!!! I had the spinach ravioli with an empanada to start. It was amazing and a must to get, along with great service. I even had to write a review even before I left the restaurant, which I never feel compelled to do! Wish I would have has room for dessert i have heard its amazing :)))",
