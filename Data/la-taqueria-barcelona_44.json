    "very average. we expected more. chips are like from a bag. (like doritos) guacamole was pretty blah. tacos pastor were ok \u00a0but a bit dry. quesadillas were better. will try again but was pretty disappointing considering the reviews. more like 2.5 stars really. just feeling generous. service was good.",
