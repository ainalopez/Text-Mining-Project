    "Given that a lot of places I wanted to try in Barcelona were closed for vacations, this one was one of the few still open and boy, was I lucky! The meal was a great value, good portion (yes, I am from the US and like to eat...) and the taste was unbelievable. \u00a0We had \"mother in law\" style snails, which were a bit salty, but the red sauce was to die for. \u00a0 We also had a cod dish, but I forgot the name of it. It was something in mayo coating, and definitely NOT the ratatouille one. Just amazing! \u00a0Also had a skewer of sausages, which was amazing, including my beloved blood sausage. \u00a0Basically, if you're looking for a great meal, for good price - this is a MUST. It is probably better to cab there if you don't know the neighborhood, because the major metro stations are kind of far, and I have no clue if you can bus it there. Very very worth going!",
