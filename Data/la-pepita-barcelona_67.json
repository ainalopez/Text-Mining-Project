    "This place was absolutely delicious. Their menu is so creative and everything we ordered was scrumptious. This place was so good we came back the next day for lunch. They are extremely welcoming and accommodating. We had a group of 8 and we had no reservation and they sat us in their sister restaurant/bar two doors down for some cava while we waited and then managed to get us a table. We had a 15 day trip through Europe and we went here on our second day and our group was still raving about this place on our way home. It was so delicious! I highly recommend the potatoes bravas, the mackerel salad, the aubergine/eggplant dish, and the white chocolate foie gras dish! FYI there are some mistranslations on the menu for instance their Jam plate should actually be Ham plate. So try to look at the spanish one and translate.",
