    "A must-see when around the beach in Barcelona and looking for a fun place for a snack and a glass (or bottle) of cava!My boyfriend and I thought that we must be in the wrong place when walking down Reina Cristina looking for a restaurant suggested by a tour guide we had earlier in the day. Then suddenly we ran into a small restaurant over pouring with people. While it looked too crowded to get into, we tried anyway and found a small space to stand near the back. I don't think there were many (if any) tables, but I suggest going in, standing around, and mingling with the other patrons. The cava (Spanish sparkling wine) is extraordinarily cheap but delicious, and I suggest getting a bottle if you think you will be there for a while. Our tour guide also mentioned it is made right there, which was a cool fact which made the experience even more fun. While the food was nothing to write home about, it was good. Try the ham sandwich.Such a fun experience in Barcelona! Check it out.",
