    "Great caf\u00e9! Definitely a favorite. The staff was incredibly friendly and kind. Service was a bit slow, but not excessively. I had pesto pasta for lunch--marvelous and perfect portion. My friend had a 'bombs chocolate' (chocolate cake) and it was very dense and rich--nothing special but delicious nonetheless. Bonus for American tourists--this caf\u00e9 allows for take-out coffee, though with such a lovely setting and directly across from Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, it's worth taking your time for the meal!",
