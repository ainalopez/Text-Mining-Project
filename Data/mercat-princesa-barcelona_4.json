    "Theft warning. \u00a0 A bag was stolen from us here as my family was sitting alone at one of the tables.The only person near the bag was a busboy who later made up a bizarre story about seeing a thief.A food stand chef came over and apologized to us and told us that this place has a huge problem of bags getting stolen.The market's manager took all our information but never followed up with us. \u00a0The manager never responded to multiple emails and calls. \u00a0Our conclusion is that the manager and the busboys are operating a theft ring here.Beware. \u00a0Hold your bags tightly and don't let go if you enter this market.",
