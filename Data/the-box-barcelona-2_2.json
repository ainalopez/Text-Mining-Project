    "One of the best bar we ve been to in one week in Barcelona.The \"latin street food\" is just delicious, and cheap, cooked in front of your eyes : burritos, nachos, quasadillas....The cocktails are both original and so good, and cheap as well.The 2 owners (the french bartender and the colombian cook) very friendly and welcoming.To finish, the bar itself is very well decorated and colorful / lightfulAt the end of the day, just go there and make your own opinion, it s definitely worth it !",
