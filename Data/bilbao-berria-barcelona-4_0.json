    "When figuring out what to eat in Barcelona, my friend said that perhaps we should try Pintxos, a type of basque tapa. He said that it was slightly different as everything was on bread and a stick and you just eat what you like and count up the sticks and pay. It sounded interesting, so we wandered around until we found this place. It looked good, so we waited for a seat.The food was really quite good. It's fun to be able to go and look at what you might like and give it a try. It can get out of hand because you can just continue eating, but eventually you do get full and give up. I had a variety of Pintxos, most of them with fish or cheese. They also had some that looked like miniature sandwiches or stuffed inside miniature croissants. We ordered the traditional white wine that one drinks with Pintxos and were quite happy with that as well. It's a fun concept and the service was pretty spot on. Definitely enjoyed it and we saw while we were there that they opened one up in London which we will definitely be checking out in the near future. Bilbao Berria has turned me into a Pintxos lover!",
