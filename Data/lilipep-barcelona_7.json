    "When I'm in town, this is one of our coffee/tea spots. We come here often with friends because it's intimate and cozy. For a small place, they have a great standard menu and good service. During certain hours they also serve hot food, but I'm usually here for the coffee and tea. My inner sweet tooth I wishes they had more cakes!",
