    "I've saved my 200th review milestone for my favorite meal of the year. Tickets was indeed, my most memorable dinner during my trip to Spain two months ago. The price was reasonable and the experience was unforgettable!I booked my reservations online through their website almost a month ahead of time, however, they are so popular that there were only few options left. But, this is a very crucial prerequisite - make your reservation! You will not get inside without a reservation. We arrived at tickets, along the diagonal. And this fun and well decorated place totally encaptured my attention. You are greeted by the host at the door, dressed as a train ticket master. Show your reservation email to gain your entrance. The nice thing about tickets is that you can be in fancy outfits or smart casual wear - the place is not uptight unlike a lot of high end dining places.Inside is a carnival - endless things to look at, bursts of colors, intriguing decorations. It's a wonderland for adults! You could either order individual items from the menu, or you could do a tasting menu - comes up to about 250euros for the 2 of us. The most memorable dishes for me was the deserts. Our server was very humorous, trying to trick us what things were edible or not. She was very entertaining!! If you decide to order items individually, don't forget to try:Chicken slide - chicken skin, fried chicken etcAir puffs with manchego cheeseOlives That has a texture of egg yolksFresh oysters Lemon custard cone Chocolate nut dessert shaped as a wine cork I will definitely visit tickets again when I'm back in Barcelona. Can't wait!!",
