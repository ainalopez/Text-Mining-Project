    "This place is so cute. It's not very big and the atmosphere is great. I loved the decoration. The food was good. It's perfect for ppl like me who love indian food but don't deal with spicy things very well.I had the chicken korma w/ basmati rice and a cheese naan which is my usual order at indian restaurants and i loved it. The staff was nice and very helpful. I guess my only issue is that it was a bit expensive but only cos i came on a sunday. They have a mon. to fri. menu for 10 euros that seems great.I will def come back but but during the week.",
