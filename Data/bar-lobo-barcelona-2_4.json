    "Great location just off of La Rambla away from all the craziness. Very modern atmosphere and accommodating staff that make you feel welcome throughout. The food was so delicious and very well presented. We had the Hummus, tomato and mozzarella, tandoori chicken (tapas style, covered with a flaky pastry), sushi style tuna and guacamole. Everything was \"lick the plate\" amazing!I found Lobos a very relaxing and fun dining experience and also a breath of fresh air in culinarily expertise in the heart of Barcelona.",
