    "I was recently in Barcelona and went to Sensi Tapas as a recommendation from a friend. \u00a0I was not disappointed one bit. \u00a0We sampled quite a bit and everything we had was awesome! \u00a0Iberian Ham, Baby Chorizos, & the homemade truffle ravioli were my favorites but everything else we had was just as good. \u00a0Had some of the best service in Barca while we were there; very friendly and helpful. \u00a0Also capped us off with some Lemoncello to end the meal. \u00a0Nice!Only criticism was that the Paella, while tasted a lot like seafood, was a little lacking in actual seafood (the full portion, which was tapas sized, had two shrimps & two mussels).",
