    "I had the regular pepita. No add ons or fancy business. I inmediately regreted this decision once I saw all the wonderful plates come out. Mine was alright. More like a 3 star, but I gave it a 4 just cause i blame myself for not getting their specialty gourmet pepitas. I am a BIG popcorn lover. So o fcourse I got the corn icecream. This was ok as well. I went alone so I decided to just get one pepita and no tapa so i could afford the dessert calories. But if i were to go back Id just skip dessert and get a tapa. Thos really is enough for just one person. No need for more. I might go back tomorriw just bevause I know I would like this place a whole lot more if I would have ordered better.",
