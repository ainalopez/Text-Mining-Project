    "My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this restaurant after the restaurant we intended to go was closed. \u00a0I am glad we went to this place instead as the food, service and atmosphere were great. \u00a0We ordered three tapas dishes (stuffed olives, meatballs with cuttlefish and blood sausages). \u00a0But star of the meal was fisherman paella which was amazing and reasonably price compare to other restaurants nearby. \u00a0Also the price of wine and sangria was pretty cheap (1.60 euro per cup)I would definitely recommend this place! Great food and great service!!",
