    "pinoxto is so overrated. don't get me wrong, it's good but i don't get the hype. when you arrive, be ready to brawl. the people around you have zero respect for social order so if you and your companion aren't paying attention someone will swipe those seats of the people just leaving. no, that did not happen to me.the food was good but nothing that i can't do on my own. we had razor clams, oxtails, some bacalao hash, and two other dishes that i asked the bartender (correct label ?) to recommend but were obviously immemorable. the razor clams were sublime, even had a little sand but i'm okay with the fresh grit of something like that. the oxtail was just good. the bacalao was a head-scratcher ... it wasn't bad but it was like juanito went and cleaned out his pantry and just mixed up whatever he didn't want with the salted cod. i don't even remember what the other two were ... one was prob a veggie or legumes because i remember wanting something green.there's a blue restaurant in the very back of the mercate, i forget what it's called but when i figure it out it's getting five stars. it serves paella negra and what not ... i suggest you try that. i never made it to el quim (tear).",
