    "This restaurant exceeded my expectations. \u00a0Just as in Napoli! \u00a0The waiters, the service, the food, everything as in Napoli. \u00a0I arrived at the restaurant with my 3 kids at about 8:30 pm, which was perfect timing as the restaurant filled to capacity shortly thereafter...including a wait line. \u00a0We did not have reservations, but I do recommend them. The pizzas were spectacular and the pasta alle vongole was perfect (just as in Italy). \u00a0For dessert we ordered the calzone con cioccolato, which was to die for. As an Italian, I can vouch this is the true deal. The waiters spoke in Italian, however also in castellano and catalan. If youve never tried mozzarella di bufala \u00a0I highly recommend it.",
