    "Yummy carrot cake and pineapple upside down cake!!I really enjoy the ambiance that they set in this simple bakery/caf\u00e9. \u00a0It's small but full of character. \u00a0According to the owner, the selection of goodies changes on a daily basis. \u00a0So you'll never really know what you'll get. \u00a0But the carrot cake seems to be a staple. \u00a0I understand why, it's incredible!I'm addicted!",
