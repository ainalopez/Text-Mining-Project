    "We went to this restaurant based on the recommendation of a bar owner of a bar nearby, and we are SO glad we tried it! Actually, my husband and I went to this restaurant a year ago, and we still talk about the steak tartare we had that night- it was soo good! Hands down the best we've ever had. The atmosphere was very laid back but edgy, the waitress was very nice and gave us excellent recommendations, and we were probably the only non-locals there. The entrance is pretty non-descript so had it not been for the recommendation from the bar owner, we wouldn't have chosen this restaurant, but we're so glad we did!",
