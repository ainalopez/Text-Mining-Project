    "My favorite place in Barcelona for tapas. Great place to take someone you want to show off a bit :) They put a lot of love into their tapas as well as service, wine and the overall atmosphere. We did book a table as we were 25 people. If you don't want or have time to wait 30-60 min you should also book. I can recommend everything on the menu. Just choose your favorite tapas and you won't be disappointed.",
