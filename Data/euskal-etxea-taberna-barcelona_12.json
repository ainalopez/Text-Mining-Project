    "This place was great! \u00a0Quick spot to stop for traditional yet modern Tapas. \u00a0It was like \u20ac1.90 per bite, which sounds cheap but it can get expensive for a full meal, so this is really a better spot for a snack or an extended appetizer. I know its all over Yelp by now but it still felt like a locals' favorite. \u00a0Don't stock up completely at the bar since they will be walking around with hot Tapas at times. \u00a0There was seating in the back which was empty; there were some bar stools out but we preferred to stand at the wall-mounted bar.",
