    "The place we were looking for was closed, and we stumbled upon this place, and it was really excellent! Now we see that it was highly reviewed, and we totally agree! \u00a0We had the cod with mushrooms, which was fabulous. \u00a0My teenaged son loved his sirloin steak with duck liver sauce, and the other son loved his steak churasco. We had the mixed seafood paella, which was quite good. Service was excellent. \u00a0Highly recommended.",
