    "Seems like most every traveler/foodie/guidebook exalts Pinotxo (Pinocchio) Bar as excellent dining, and indeed there is definitely merit to that claim! I arrived at Mercat de la Boqueria after a little siesta of my own (approx. 2pm) and not surprisingly found myself amidst several other enthused diners vying for a coveted seat (there's only four round tables seating three and a handful of bar seats). In my discouraged state and sadness came a light at the end of the tunnel when I found myself standing next to a couple of young gals from the States almost done with their meal. Coincidentally, they hail from my beloved hometown. With Los Angeles as our link they immediately became my best friends and cherished seat savers. I waited about 15 minutes until they finished their last dish and offered me their table. Finally, I had hit the jackpot!!! MY ORDER (tapas style):1. Razor clams, 12.502. Anchovies with eggplant and red peppers (half order), 4.503. Grilled lamb, 5.504. Coke, 2.005. Water, 1.00TOTAL with tax and tip: 26.30 Euros (approx $33.00 U.S.), and every penny worth it!!! Favorite Dish: Everything was amazing, but def do try the razor clams, which is a unique and rare seafood item for the American palate.Directions: As you enter the market, it's in the right side.",
