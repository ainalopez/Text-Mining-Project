    "Run don't walk to this delicious little nugget in Barcelona..not only is the food amazing but so is the hospitality of the owners...we found tucco from yelp..other reviews are spot on...the pasta is fresh and delicious..we had it all..empanadas were the best my husband has ever had..the simple bread with tomatoes was so good I packed extra to take back to my hotel.the prices you cannot beat for the quality...we had main dish..drink and fresh made dessert all for $16.00\u20ac...you order your food first and pay then they bring the freshly made food right to your table. This was our 3rd trip to Barcelona..we will be back..again hopefully soon! :-)",
