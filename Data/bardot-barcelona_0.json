    "We came here with FoodLover and it was incredible. The red wine comes from the region and was the right balance for the meal. To start off, we had croquettes and octopus with potatoes. We then had beef medallions that were slow cooked and finished off with rice paper around the meat - not my favorite dish as the meat come out quite tough. The highlight for me was the main course and dessert - duck with potatoes. Duck was cooked a beautiful medium rare - one of the best duck dishes I've had in a really long time and the dessert was chocolate tortilla with pop rocks and crema catalana with cinnamon ice cream. I would come back just to get the cinnamon ice cream.Thanks FoodLover and Bardot for a lovely dining experience",
