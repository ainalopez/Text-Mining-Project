    "A wonderful neighborhood spot in Gracias~ We stopped in on first night in Barcelona, and the warmth and casual atmosphere was just what we needed. \u00a0The service was superb. \u00a0We had two kids with us, and the staff was welcoming and patient.The food was light, honest and rustic, and the price was very reasonable. \u00a0Our favorite was the pulpo with patate. \u00a0We will definitely be back.",
