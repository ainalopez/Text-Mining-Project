    "Ziryab has quickly become my favorite place in Barcelona. The first time I was drew in by the live music, which only happens on wednesday evening, but then I come back several times 'cause I fell in love with the place. The food and the drinks (try the mojito) are prepared with attention and passion. The selection of wine is good and the beautiful music is carefully hand picked. The staff is very friendly and speaks fluently many languages (english, italian, french among others) so no traveller will feel out of place.To sum it up: if you'll be in Barcelona, even only for one night, you have to try this place.",
