    "Amazing dining experience from start to finish.I can go on and on about how much I adored BlackLab, but I will keep it short. The restaurant is very well decorated, and has an extremely welcoming aura that makes you want to stay there forever! They have a comprehensive menu of your basic \"American\" classics -- burgers, wings, ribs, pulled pork, and fries to name a few. There are even some cool Asian dishes for you to try, though I didn't this time around.Now, the real kicker here is the beer! They have a list of beers that they brew IN-HOUSE, ranging from pales to darks to IPA's, and a list of guest beers on tap that come from different countries. Phenomenal! Since coming to Spain, it's been forever since I found a joint that served foreign beer, so BlackLab is really the place to go if you're down for a great brew. TL;DR: this place rocks and they take their beers very seriously!",
