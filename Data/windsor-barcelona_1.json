    "In Barcelona but wishing you were in New York or San Francisco? \u00a0This is the place for you. \u00a0Nice service, nice food, by far the most expensive we have encountered in Barcelona -- and little local flavor. \u00a0Friends recommended it and my spouse really wanted to try it. \u00a0It was fine but a dumb way to spend an evening in Barcelona. \u00a0If you are here for two weeks and get homesick in the middle and feel like you are not spending enough, come here. \u00a0 Food is first-rate, service is nice.",
