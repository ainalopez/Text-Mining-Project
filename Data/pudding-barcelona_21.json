    "Been traveling Spain for a month and I realize the service isn't what you'd expect to find in the states where servers work for tips but this was the worst waiting experience I've had in this country. Took a couple minutes for anyone to even notice that I had entered the restaurant and needed a seat. Once seated, took 10 mins for the waitress to take my order. And when the meal was finished, took 15 mins to get the check. She just plain forgot about me; which she acknowledged with a \"disculpe.\" Food was average and overpriced - 15 euro for crepes and a quiche. Compare that to the much better (and cheaper) breakfast I had today in Barcelona - 8.50 euro for muesli and French toast.",
