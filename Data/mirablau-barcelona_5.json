    "I'm giving this place 5 out of 5 because of the view. \u00a0It was just perfect. \u00a0With it being our honeymoon, the ambiance fit perfectly. \u00a0Highly recommend this place to out of towners. \u00a0Its worth the hike up the hill or a cab will do. \u00a0After your last sip of your cocktail, head over the the lamb restaurant down the hill---you won't be disappointed!!!",
