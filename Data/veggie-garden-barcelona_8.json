    "Super-delicious! \u00a0I ordered the daily special (includes an app, main course, dessert, and either water or wine): salad, thali, and apple crisp, and hubby ordered the thali and a strawberry & banana smoothie. \u00a0Exceptionally good eats and the smoothie was to die for! \u00a0Go for the daily special - Yes, it's a ton of food, but for 8.50 euro, you can't beat the price and you get to try a lil something of everything. \u00a0I thought the thali with the special would be a reduced portion, but it's not. \u00a0They do accept credit cards (5 euro min). \u00a0A hit for both a vegetarian and carnivore!",
