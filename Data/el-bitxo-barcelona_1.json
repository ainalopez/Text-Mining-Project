    "I don't really know where to start with this one.What an absolute gem!So you walk past this unassuming place and could be forgiven for thinking it's a small florist. It smells of flowers in here, because it is actually full of them. A nice bunch on every table!The menu is written on bits of paper hanging from the wall, and the person who presumably owns the place given the attention he pays to his customers is super friendly.And the food is divine. A real alternative to the usual tapas dishes in the area.I think this may well be the best restaurant in Barcelona!The only drawback is it's tiny, but all that does is encourage you to talk to the people at the next table.Amazing! :)",
