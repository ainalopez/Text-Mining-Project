    "This is a nice place to go if you are looking for something other than Spanish tapas. \u00a0They offer more traditional 'American' breakfasts (omelettes, eggs Benedict, etc.). I had the eggs florentine and thought it was good. Nothing superb but it was nice to have a more substantial breakfast after 8 days of tapas.",
