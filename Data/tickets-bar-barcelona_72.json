    "Ferran Adria's new spot, Tickets was a must on my list of eateries while in Barcelona. I sat by the \"name in lights\" area and told my waiter of food allergies and flavor dislikes. He then presented me with 12 courses (there would have been more, but I am only 1 person and couldn't go on). The experience that lasted approximately 2.5 hours was so inventive. Each course left my palate wanting more. I would not miss out on the olives, mini airbags with Manchego, Tepid oyster, razor clam, rabbit ribs and ink-stuffed calamari. My waiter insisted on my having dessert, even though I never eat it and do not have a sweet tooth. If you don't know of Adria, make it your goal to research and check out this spot. It's to-die-for!",
