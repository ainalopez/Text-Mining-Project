    "I went here after visiting Sagrada Familia and had the absolute best meal of my trip at Arco Iris. The four course vegetarian meal was delicious, creative, and fresh. There was plenty of variety in the choices so everyone could get something they wanted. There was a lot of great quality food for the very reasonable (9 euro) price. Additionally, the manager and waitstaff were friendly and made the experience one I won't forget. Our waitress was very sweet and helped me understand what the different dishes were in spite of my poor spanish. The dessert I ordered was not my favorite but since I was so full from the meal I was happy to leave having only a few bites of it. However, the manager noticed I hadn't finished it and while I was at the front paying, he offered me another dessert without me even mentioning not liking the first dessert. Considering every seat in the restaurant was full and he was not personally serving us I was beyond impressed that he noticed this small detail and went out of his way to make sure I was completely happy with the meal. You can't go wrong going here, I'd eat there every day!",
