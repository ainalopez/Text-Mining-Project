    "Super fun, good food and extremely cheap. \u00a0After a full day at the Miro museum (just up the hill) we walked down to this gem. \u00a0Half of our group stood at the bar but that was fine - suited the relaxed atmosphere. \u00a0Everything was one Euro even the beer - you walk around with your plate and pick what you like. \u00a0These were all pintxos (except for the postre) very tasty and because of the turnover very fresh. \u00a0Try the tortilla and the crema catalana. \u00a0Very friendly busy waitstaff behind the counter.",
