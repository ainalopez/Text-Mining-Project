    "Do not eat here if visiting Barcelona. Not tourist friendly \u00a0One night they asked if we had reservations. Next night called and said they do not take reservations. When we went anyway they asked if we had reservations. When questioned in Spanish they said reservations only taken the day earlier. Spend your money at a restaurant that treats you like a welcome customer and visitor and not as a outsider. Sad but one of many examples in this city that is on the decline (I.e pickpockets, crime, and an arrogant bad attitude)",
