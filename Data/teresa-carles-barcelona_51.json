    "I lived in Barcelona for 10 years and being a vegetarian I can't say the food is one of the strong holds of the city. Plus it is getting worse by the minute with the aggravated invasion of tourists and the catering to single-time-eaters. Teresa Carles is definitely one of my favorite spots. It totally saved the day in Barcelona. The food is great. You can see there is a chef behind the composition of the plates. I've been there so many times and tried all kind of different dishes and drinks. I always left with a smile. I particularly love it after a hard and long night out :)They change their menu seasonally and it is great. Though sometimes I worry about losing my favorite dishes :) I became close to some of the waiters/waitresses and I was surprised to hear that the management and owners of the restaurant are horrid with their employees. This is disgusting. If this turns out to be true I am staying away.",
