    "Food 4 stars. Service 2 stars. We went here our last night in Barcelona because it was always busy and conveniently located across the street from our hotel. Our sangria was mostly juice. We waited so long for our waiter we nearly left. When we got his attention he was rude. After we ordered, the food quickly came out and was very good. I had the spinach salad and my husband had pasta with pesto that rivaled my homemade pesto!",
