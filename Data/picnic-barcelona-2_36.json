    "Picnic is one of those gems that restores your hope in Barcelona cuisine after suffering a disastrous run in with another barmanolo (aka old man bars). Carefully chosen, seasonal ingredients. Good wine list and knowledgeable staff. Chefs all seem foreign (maybe American?), and that can be a good thing. Try the coca bread, the pulpo and the couscous.",
