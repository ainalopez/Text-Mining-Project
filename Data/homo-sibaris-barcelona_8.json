    "As an avid fan of beer, Barcelona is a bit disappointing. That is until you visit Homo Sibaris. I was pleasantly surprised to find Cantillon, Zinnebier, and Cigar City beers here. And I was fortunate enough to meet the owner, who was eager to talk about beer with me. If you are a true beer fan, and find yourself in Barcelona, this is the place to go!",
