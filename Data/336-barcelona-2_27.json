    "Absolute insanity. This place opens at 7:30. The chef/owner only accepts reservations for the number of spaces he has... for the entire evening. At 730 walk ups were being turned away from the empty restaurant for not having a reservation. I tried again at 9 and 1030. In all cases, the place was never 1/3 full.In fairness, I can respect the desire to maintain quality control or just be a person who needs to be in control, this place is just a bit much.Nothing about the restaurant says to expect a fabulous experience. However, perhaps you can score a reservation and try it for yourself.",
