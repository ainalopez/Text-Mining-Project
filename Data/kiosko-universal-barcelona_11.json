    "Kiosko Universal is no doubt an above average Tapas bar. \u00a0Here are 3 tips to make your experience more enjoyable...1. You MUST get the omelet with the REALLY FRESH assortment of mushrooms.2. You may get a fat, bald, dickhead at the counter taking your order. I'm not sure if we accidently sat in the \"Spanish Only\" section, or that he was pissed about his job...oh no it was just us, he was somewhat friendly to others...so yes, I will stick with just a dick! In this case refer to #3.3. \u00a0Drink plenty of refreshing beer to forget about #2. Good food and beer always beat a dick in the end.",
