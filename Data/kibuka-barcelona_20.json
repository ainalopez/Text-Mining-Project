    "I went on my first visit to Barcelona after reading the reviews in Yelp! I live in Madrid and was raised in Asia. Unfortunately in Madrid asian food is not very good, they adapt everything to spanish taste buds. Also it is hard to find a japanese \u00a0restaurant that has something other than Sushi, which btw I don't like...this was an absolute surprise. Best of all they have Mochi!!!!",
