    "Not the best place for tapas, although the menu is certainly friendly enough for foreigners to read. Although there are a bunch of options, the food was way too salty for my taste. Service was good until the end when the waitress asked me where I was from. After I told her \"Texas,\" she then wanted to ask where I was really from, because my appearance obviously suggested I was from elsewhere. I understand etiquette in other countries is different, but it still felt uncalled for. Anyways, nice atmosphere but not really worth going to.",
