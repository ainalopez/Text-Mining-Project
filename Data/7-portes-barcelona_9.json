    "Like all of you, I looked up this place on Yelp before my family and i went. \u00a0I tried to set up a reservation by calling ahed of time. \u00a0The man I spoke with told me there was no reservations because they were fully booked. \u00a0He said it would be a 30-45 minute wait. \u00a0We decided to go anyways because we wanted to try paella for the first time in the best restaurant we could find. \u00a0 When we arrived, we expected to see a full outer/inner dinning area, there wasn't anyone outside and only a few tables were taken inside. \u00a0Our 30-45 minute wait was only seconds, which was not too shabby. \u00a0I just don't appreciate being told one thing and arriving to find the complete opposite is the case. \u00a0 \u00a0 After being seated at a white linen table by a man in a tuxedo and looking around, we quickly felt like we were under dressed. \u00a0All the servers were wearing tuxedos and the place felt very formal, however the other patrons had shorts and t-shirts on just like us. \u00a0My girlfriend and I wanted to split an order of (fish only) Rich man's Paella. \u00a0Which is enough for two people. \u00a0If your really hungry, you mite be able to handle the whole thing by yourself. \u00a0It was very delicious and full of flavor. \u00a0It had 1 VERY SMALL piece of lobster tail and a lot of squid, clams, and mussels. \u00a0I thought for being called \"Rich Man's Paella\" and being served by waiters in tuxedos, there would be a little more shellfish. \u00a0However, that was not the case. \u00a0 \u00a0 All in all I thought the services was top notch as well as the flavor of the food. \u00a0just don't be afraid to ask your server what exactly is going to be included in your dish.",
