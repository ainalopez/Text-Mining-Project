    "This place was a 10 out of 10, especially for Barcelona.the fried green tomatoes were a winner, and the french toast was to die for.Food was extremely fresh, and exciting. Lost of great items on the menu to choose from, and they serve alcohol :)will definitely revisit if i'm back in Barcelona.",
