    "Best pinchas (tapas) you can get in Poble Sec! \u00a0pretty good selection, I like the ones with the chorizo on top, and their kitchen runners are always working to backfill the popular items. \u00a0Dessert was almost too sweet, however the churros are excellent! \u00a0small place, always crowded, but good hosts and servers, and the Moritz Beers are cold!",
