    "Excellent meal here. \u00a0We showed up around 1 pm without a reservation and were seated at the bar. \u00a0The place was jampacked by the time we left. \u00a0The service wasn't terribly helpful, but everything we had was excellent, so I still recommend it. \u00a0It's Michelin recommended as well. The pan con tomate was the best we've had in Barcelona (a bit more drizzle most likely). \u00a0The razor clams were delicious - not chewy at all, with a light but tasty combination of olive oil and lemon. \u00a0The asparagus with fresh garlic had scallions that were chewy, but my friends enjoyed this dish more than I did. \u00a0We also ordered the one-piece montaditos - I thought the foie was excellent, while my friends thought the brie was okay. \u00a0The food seemed better even than Cal-pep!",
