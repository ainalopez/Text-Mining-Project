    "We had no idea where to eat and we were walking around when we stumbled upon this place. It was packed... So we figured we would try it. We only waited about 5 minutes when a standing spot at the bar opened. The waiter was so fun and nice! It was amazing that you could see all the products, so we literally just pointed at what looked good! The waiter was great and helped us out, giving suggestions and telling us to get a combo plate of cheese and meat... That way, we got a lot more variety. We ordered a bottle of their house made cava..... I highly recommend it! AMAZING and inexpensive! I work in wine in California so I definitely appreciate a good wine, and this hit the spot! It was the perfect tapas lunch. We got olives, jamon, 2 cheeses, potato omelette, bread, variety of desserts (which included a dessert wine to dunk biscotti in) and a bottle of cave for............... 35 euro! We were stuffed and so happy. \u00a0Especially if you want to go to the Picasso museum ( which we did after) go to this restaurant!",
