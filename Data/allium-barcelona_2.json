    "Probably one of the worst places I've been to in the many times I've been to awesome Barcelona. \u00a0Super packed with bored tourists. \u00a0Dishes not so good. \u00a0Service even worse. \u00a0Don't understand how they're Km0 which is the reason I went in the first place. \u00a0Rating system of Slow Food seems to really be lacking around here. \u00a0Don't waste your money on this place.",
