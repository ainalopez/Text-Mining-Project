    "Super yummy tapas! Cheap, 1-2\u20ac per dish. Tasty mojitos too, and helpful staff. Generally crowded with a mix of locals and tourists, but lots of places to sit or stand with a plate and drink. The dishes are not always labeled, but feel free to ask the staff. Bathrooms are surprisingly clean for such a busy place, which is always a pleasant surprise. Try the quiche on the mini-blini! Omnomnom.",
