    "This method of selling food in Barcelona is genius! \u00a0 Platters of appetizer sized bread with a variety of toppings speared with toothpick are set on the counter. You pick what you like and you get charged by the toothpicks you accumulate. \u00a0So simple yet so wonderful! \u00a0It's like dim sum counting your plates.We weren't too happy with the small amount of wine poured into our glass.We liked the stuffed pepper, the prime rib in a cracker, a soft cheese covered in jam, some seafood ones, ham, sausages, spanish potato, etc. \u00a0Yes, I'll admit it, we had 13 toothpicks! It's just fun and the people working there answered all of our questions. \u00a0I did get tired standing as I stood for hours watching the Three Kings Parade. \u00a0The hubby had sat thru three hour opera so he was fine. \u00a0We arrived about 9:15 pm and it was packed. \u00a0They told us to keep walking toward back of restaurant, and yes, a place to stand at bar back there. \u00a0So don't be discouraged when you first walk in.We think we would go other places next time as it seems they make the same items nightly",
