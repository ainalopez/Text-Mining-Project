    "So their spit roast chicken looks amazing in the window. Such a shame they thought just because we were English , we would settle for older dry chicken which had been reheated in the deep frier. The final straw was trying to serve us 4day old slice of melon instead of fresh. This place should be good but let down by the tourist treatment... So go and make sure your chicken comes from the spit fresh and you will be fine.. You get 2 stars just because of potential.. However don't think I'll return.",
