    "My boyfriend and I went on holiday in Barcelona and accidentally stumbled upon this gem. What a lucky find! Makamaka combines the charm of a local diner with the vibe of of a beach party. I ordered the lamb burger & chips, and really enjoyed both. My boyfriend and I also split a pitcher of sangria. It had so much fresh fruit in it, I'm quite sure I got my 5-a-day!An interesting quirk in the restaurant were the bathrooms, which are located in a shed. How they brought the shed *indoors* is beyond me, but the toilets were actually really clean... despite being a structure meant to store junk lol.The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and kept the post-dinner pints flowing. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant was the wall of wooden forks covered in messages from past patrons. If you see one that says Molly (hearts) Dave, that's mine :)",
