    "Enter the ramblas, turn right and you'll see this place on the left. Grab a seat wherever you can. The old grandpa that works the coffee side of the place is so sweet; can't speak English but he wants you to enjoy your food.They likely will start by asking if you want peace or carne and show you some fresh seafood. I instead for the kidney beans and the baby squid with white beans. Everyone there seems to order these two dishes, which may be because they read yelp and that's all we talk about. It's super delicious, flavorful, and fresh! They automatically give you bread which they charge minimal for, which most places in Barcelona do.You can apparently get smaller versions of the dishes by asking for it in \"media\" (mehdia).A place to definitely stop by early for. Enjoy!",
