    "This place is solid. \u00a0Great, reasonably priced food. \u00a0The staff are friendly and the service is pretty good. \u00a0 This restaurant in in a beautiful setting and is very popular. \u00a0 I went here in 1997 and returned this summer in 2013. \u00a0It's still a gem and a great value in the Pla\u00e7a Reial. \u00a0Try it! \u00a0You'll have a fun and memorable meal.",
