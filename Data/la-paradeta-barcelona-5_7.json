    "The shit they sell here shouldn't be called seafood. \u00a0It should be called no food. \u00a0We ordered a bunch of mussels and there was no damn mussel living in these shells. \u00a0They were smaller than boogers. \u00a0The razor clams were full of grit and sand. \u00a0They charge you for fucking mayonesa and they keep trying to upsell you like you're at a timeshare presentation. \u00a0Motherfucker, if I want more food, I'll order that shit. \u00a0If I want to save room for tapas, why can't you leave me alone? \u00a0Why you got to harass me until I relent and order another shrimp. \u00a0Damn, I guess that shit works. \u00a0Anyway, them gambas are pretty good, but I'd rather go to red lobster. \u00a0At least the bread there is free.",
