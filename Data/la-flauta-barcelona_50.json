    "Loved the tapas here. \u00a0Especially the octopus and mussels dishes. La Flauta provided the best foie gras I have ever had in my life. \u00a0We even used this opportunity to convince our non-adventurous friends to try some new dishes (they were afraid of the foie gras though). We even ended with the crema catalana for dessert which is basically creme brulee but that was excellent as well. Service was a tad slow and it also seemed a bit touristy, but I guess that is expected in barcelona. \u00a0Not knocking any stars off for that, just informing. \u00a0Had a ton of dishes and drinks and everything came out to about 15 -20 euro per person.",
