    "Restaurant was last stop on a Barcelona Food Lover tour, simply amazing experience! \u00a0We had a 6-course dinner, with items ranging from olives, pasta, soup, fish, and beef. Chef's technique is modern and inventive with their interpretation of the tapas experience. \u00a0Service was very attentive, always keeping the wine glasses full and explained all the dishes very well. \u00a0Location was on a street that was right off the Ramble street (not in the Las Ramblas area).",
