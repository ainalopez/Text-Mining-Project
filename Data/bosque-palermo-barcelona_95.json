    "The food here is delicious.I came here on a Friday night and we were both HUNGRY. Hungry enough that I had to make an effort not to stare at other what other people were eating for too long. Hungry enough that when the guys sitting next to us let the waiter take away their uneaten bread and fries, I seriously considered snatching it from the waiter's hands.And that is because the waiter was slow, slow, slow (even by Spain standards-- the people whose food I was staring at made comments too about his slowness). A small hiccup in what was otherwise a great experience.",
