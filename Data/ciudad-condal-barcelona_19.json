    "I've come here five times for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. I'd highly recommend the beef tenderloin hot tapas and the lobster paella every Tuesday. For breakfast, the Spanish and cheese omelette were delicious as well. Saeed and Jaime were absolutely wonderful. I'd highly recommend these two. Just wonderful. Ate all three times outside so I don't know the ambience inside, but it's great and the heaters are warm but could be warmer! I've tried their coconut pudding, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, chocolate cake, and strawberry tart. I'd say that the chocolate cake was undoubtedly my favorite, and I'm not a chocolate cake fan!",
