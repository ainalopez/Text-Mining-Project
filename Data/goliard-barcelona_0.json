    "Fantastic. Excellent tasting menu (our favorite dish of the evening was the beef tataki), excellent service, very charming space. And coming from the SF Bay Area, this prices here seem like an absolute steal. Tasting menu for two plus a great bottle of Rioja = 68 Euros. Crazy.We didn't have a reservation, but we went when they opened and didn't have any trouble getting a table. It does look like they book up, though, so you might want to call ahead.",
