    "I've only come in to grab cold-pressed juice and both flavors were quite good. The Vampire juice (with beets, ginger and lemon) was tart and refreshing, but I favored the Green Medicine, as the kale, grape, and lemon combination was perfectly balanced.

My girlfriends eat here often though and are certainly fans-- it's quite pricey though.",
