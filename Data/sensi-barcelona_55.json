    "OK - the food here is fine - not great but flavorable (and certainly better than any of the small cafes around the plazas). \u00a0So you ask \"why am I a fan?\" \u00a0The wait staff - we were desperately off schedule and it was well past their posted serving time - it was approaching 2am - there were a couple of tables finishing their meals and we had been turned away by 2 other restaurants. \u00a0Not only did Sensi re-open the kitchen they insisted that we order whatever we wanted - and even brought us a couple of rounds of wine - we were not rushed and they were very friendly and thoughtful - you would not get that type of services in the states. \u00a0The owner should be very proud of their staff. Thanks Sensi!",
