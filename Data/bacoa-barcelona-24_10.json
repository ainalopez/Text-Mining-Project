    "The organic beef burger and brava potato fries with manchego cheese was delicious BUT the chicken burger which is said to be seasoned for 12 hours was extremely salty and undercooked. \u00a0And for that I give it two stars. \u00a0Do not get the chicken burger! \u00a0The organic beef was delicious but was salty as well!",
