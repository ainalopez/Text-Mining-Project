    "When we went for dinner, we had a good meal; but it wasnt anything too amazing (hence my previous 3 star review).However, once we went for breakfast? They shot up to a full 5 stars. They offer fresh juices! (the carrot, apple, ginger one was incredible); they have the best cortado in Barcelona, and their breakfast offerings are all delicious. We came here for breakfast 3 different mornings; its THAT good. Plus, they were located on the same block as our hotel which made the convenience unbeatable. If I am ever back in Barcelona this place is definitely on my list for breakfast. They have more healthy options than anywhere else we went to and the service was always great. Highly recommend.",
