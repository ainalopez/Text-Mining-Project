    "Food was excellent. In particular, the eggs on fries with foie on top was superb and memorable. Also excellent were the bikini sandwiches (toasted sandwiches with black truffle, ham and cheese) and the beef stew. Rice was good but we had better elsewhere.Most of the reviewers who disliked the place seem to take issue with long waits or questionable service. Arriving before 1pm on a Monday, I experienced none of the said issues. Instead, the servers I encountered were friendly and helpful and ambience was casual and fun.I highly recommend the place.",
