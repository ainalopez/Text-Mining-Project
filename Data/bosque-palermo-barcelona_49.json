    "Enjoyed my dining experience here! We were fortunate to grab a table outside and ordered the Paella which takes about 35-40 min to prepare. \u00a0In the meantime, we ordered Mussels and Calamari. Appetizers were fine nothing that jumped out but we were set on the main course. When the Paella arrived (good for 2ppl) I noticed the amount of seafood didn't match the price of the plate. Flavors and taste were delicious and I wish the broth had a bit more spice or kick to it. I know it's a seafood Paella but I was anticipating some type of chorizo or sausage in the meal. Overall, it was very satisfying and I may have had higher expectations. .",
