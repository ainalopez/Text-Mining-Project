    "Somorosstro, nestled on a side street in Barceloneta, is non-assuming and if you didn't no better, could easily be mistaken for a local bar. \u00a0But don't be fooled...this is no local bar (nor has it been overrun by tourists).We had the duck rice (do it!), spicy potatoes (not that spicy for those with a low tolerance for heat), and zucchini flower with goat cheese. \u00a0All were incredible although the zucchini flower really stood out.We ordered shrimp and found them to be small, albeit cooked to perfection and very flavorful. \u00a0Earlier in the day we had massive shrimp so our expectations were pretty high. \u00a0The liter of sangria came cold with no ice and seemed neverending. \u00a0We had to bear down to finish it!And then they brought desert - chocolate ganache with bread, sea salt and olive oil. \u00a0Unreal....and just capped off an overall incredible dining experience.All in all, a great place with creative and flavorful food that shouldn't be missed, particularly if you are staying close by.",
