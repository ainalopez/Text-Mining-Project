    "We entered and were greeted with welcoming service. The staff is rather friendly but does not speak well English. To drink, we attempted to order some cold beers but the staff said they did not have cold beer. So we had sodas instead. We started with bruschetta, which was made with authentic Italian bread and olive oil. The tomatoes were finely chopped with the seeds removed to prevent the bread from turning soggy. We ordered one pizza and one pasta dish. For pasta, black truffle spaghetti with sausage. Absolutely delightful! The pasta was cooked al dente tossed in a light and tasty cream sauce. Inside were small pieces of black truffle mushroom and finely chopped ground sausage. Each bite was filled with flavor, but still tasted light. For pizza, we ordered a vegetarian pizza. The crust was thin and crispy. The pizza was topped with fresh vegetables. There was a bit too much cheese on the pizza but boy was it delicious. The service was great. I dropped my fork and the waiter quickly ran to get me another fork. I highly recommend la Bella Napoli for authentic Italian dining at a reasonable price with great service.",
