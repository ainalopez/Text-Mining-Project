    "Hands down, the best meal we had in Barcelona. Warning to all my fellow travelers: there are a bunch of places in Barcelona that sell frozen, packaged paella. We learned this the hard way. After strolling around Baceloneta, we were famished. We were a bit wary of the places on the main street, in fear that we would get more packaged food. Walking down a small side street, we came across Can Ramonet. Several tables sitting outside had huge pans of paella on the table that looked absolutely delicious. It's definitely a bit pricier than other restaurants in Barcelona, but well worth it. We ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and seafood paella to share. The shrimp came out in a skillet, still bubbling away in a simple but delicious garlic and oil mixture. The paella here is LEGIT. So flavorful, with lots of fresh seafood. We sampled some desserts as well, and they were on point. The restaurant itself is incredibly charming, and service was excellent. A definite must-try in Barcelona!",
