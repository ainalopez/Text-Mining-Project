    "This restaurant is located on a really small street. We came here for lunch. It was pretty crowded inside and loud. The gluten free items on the menu were labeled so it made it easy for me. We each had the salad, one item, and drink for 9,75 euros. My friends and I ordered the same thing, so the food came out pretty fast. The salad was good but small. It was topped with figs and crumbled cheese with a light dressing. The waiter wasn't very observant and took my friend's salad away before she was done eating it. It seemed once the entrees were ready, they cleared the table quickly. My friend was mid chew and caught up with everything going around that she realized her salad was gone when it was too late. The gluten free bread was warm but chewy. The tilapia we had for our entree was nicely cooked. The coffee we ordered at the end seemed to take a little too long. Overall a nice restaurant, but the service could be better.",
