    "Absolutely love this place, it's pretty much my dream brunch place. I had an amazing ricotta hot cake with halloumi, avocado, smoked salmon and two poached eggs. It's 7 hours later and I'm still not hungry. It was so delicious and a really big portion for 9 quid. I added the eggs so that was an extra 1.50. Washed down with a yummy iced latte. The decor is cosy and I was really impressed with the staff. They were run off their feet but kept on top of things and even managed to be polite to a really difficult and demanding customer sitting beside me. A++. Will defo be back here when I come back to Barca.",
