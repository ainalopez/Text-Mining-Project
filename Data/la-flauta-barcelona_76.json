    "One of the few places open early (7pm-ish) in the Eixample, so we wondered in not knowing what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised by the wide menu of tapas. The portions were generous and the food was great. We started with a salad, larges enough to share. Some tomato bread. The grilled baby octopus (Excellent). Foie Gras. and Sausage with White Beans. All for less than 35 Euros for two with wine. By 8:30 the place was packed! We are going back again tonight!!",
