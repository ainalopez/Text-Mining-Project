    "Honestly, I only wanted to try this place because I'm a fan of the owners but I was pleasantly surprised with the food. I tried the chilaquiles, the cochinita pibil, and the ceviche borracho. All three were delicious but I must say the chilaquiles were the best. The presentation of all of the dished were superb and the taste was great. The decor inside is all about Giovani Dos Santos but it is beautifully executed. If I ever find myself in Barcelona again and crave some Mexican Food, I will go back to Cantina 10 for some chilaquiles and horchata.",
