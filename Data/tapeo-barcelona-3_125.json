    "Highly recommended! This was our best meal in Barcelona (including high profile places like Barceloneta). The restaurant is located in a lovely alley near the Picasso Museum in Barcelona's old town. The ambience is great and the staff is friendly and English-speaking. We had the saut\u00e9ed vegetables, Bravas, chicken with soy sauce and ginger, and mushrooms with sweetbread, all of which were heavenly.",
