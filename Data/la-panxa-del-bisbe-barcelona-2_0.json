    "My favorite meal during my 10 days in Barcelona! It is a tapas joint, so you can try a few things on the menu. My friend and I shared so we were able to try 4 different items. Each plate seemed to get better than the last! Tender meat that melts in your mouth, and everything had SO much flavor. Lovely owner, visible kitchen, and a wonderfully imaginative menu. Highly recommend!",
