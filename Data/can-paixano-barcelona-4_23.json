    "We went here because 2 friends recommended it. I have to say that I wasn't impressed. Firstly, we went late on a Saturday night so it was jam packed. We were packed in like sardines and trying to order and then find a place to eat was super difficult. The service was quick and the prices are super cheap, but you do get the quality you pay for. The bocadillos are good, but not amazing. The food overall was mediocre, so I'm not sure why we waited in line forever to stand in a packed place for mediocre food. The staff was not friendly, or at least the guy that served us wasn't. If you go to Barcelona and you want to try this place - go at an odd time when you have some more time to spend and more room to stand. Otherwise - you aren't missing anything amazing if you skip out.",
