    "Sensi- absolutely delicious from the food, to the ambience to the knowledgable and friendly waitstaff. Visiting from Toronto on our honeymoon my husband and I took a leap of faith by following the reviews of local tapas bars in Barcelona. We asked the waiters opinion on house specialities and we were not disappointed. As a self appointed foodie I cannot believe how absolutely satisfied and innovated the food was.Definitely a return visit in the future.",
