    "Small just off the beaten track... and delicious! We came in just as their lunch kitchen was finishing up (at 4pm) and had a wonderful meal. There isn't a menu so to speak as much as there are daily / weekly dishes they serve up. From the 4 tapas items we had, they could do no wrong. There's a good mix of locals and visitors in their small venue, and the music and ambiance were perfect for an afternoon lunch. Definitely would go again. Great people, great food, and great service.",
