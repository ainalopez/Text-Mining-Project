    "Very popular place. It's best to go earlier in the morning to avoid waiting in line. They offer a good brunch menu. I ordered the eggs benedict and pancakes. The eggs benedict was dry on the hollandaise sauce and the pancakes were average. But nonetheless it's a good classic breakfast place albeit a bit pricey.",
