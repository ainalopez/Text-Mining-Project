    "The loveliest restaurant in Barcelona. Creative food, cheap drinks, and a dynamite trio of proprietors running the bar and manning the open kitchen. You can't come in here without having an interesting discussion and making a new friend. A great place for a beer and a tapa, or a full-on meal.",
