    "Amazing. This was the very last stop on my visit to Madrid & Barcelona, and it definitely ended my trip on a high note. A great representative of modern Barcelona's culinary culture. I loved everything that we tried, as well as the staff, the ambiance, and the arrangement of the restaurant itself. I highly recommend sitting at the bar! It grants you a front seat view of all of the fresh seafood, meats, and cocktails. To be frank, I dont remember the name of everthing that I ordered, but each dish was better than the last. I ordered patatas bravas at every restaurant I dined at in Spain and Paco Meralgo's were supreme! My crema catalina was gorgeous and delicious. I cannot say enough great things about this place; all of the food was fresh, of outstanding quality, and prepared to the highest standards. This will be my first stop upon my return to Barcelona!",
