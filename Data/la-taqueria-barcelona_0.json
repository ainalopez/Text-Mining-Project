    "Small, colourful restaurant located in a quiet street near to La Sagrada Familia, La Taqueria's menu comprises an excellent selection of tasty Mexican dishes, cooked to order and served by friendly staff. Very reasonably priced considering it's near a huge tourist attraction. Couldn't fault it, well worth a visit.",
