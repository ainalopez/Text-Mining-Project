    "Very average tourist style Tapas bar. What does tourist style mean? It means I don't see why any local would come there. To be honest, it is too similar to what I find in New York to feel worth visiting on a vacation. \u00a0The food was very standard, and the price was ok.oh by the way, YOU CANNOT JUST GET DRINKS HERE. If you buy a drink you are required to buy 2 tapas per person. Yeah, I am still kind of pissed about that.",
