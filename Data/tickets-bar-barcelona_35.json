    "i was most excited to eat at Tickets after I booked my trip to Barcelona and i'm so glad that this placed lived up to the hype i built up for myself haha. i locked up my lunchtime reservation exactly a month away from the date i wanted and using their website was pretty easy since i was flexible with my meal time. got here at 2pm for Saturday lunch and the place was already pretty full but me and justin b. were seated at the main bar area so we could watch most of the dishes being plated which was pretty awesome to see how meticulous each dish was. love the carnival theme throughout the restaurant too. the menus are super cute with their designs and while we were there an el bulli documentary was playing on the tv that was pretty interesting to watch in between bites haha.we decided to just let our server decide the menu for us so i liked the surprise aspect of our meal since we were game to pretty much eat anything on the menu haha. also its pretty awesome that your place settings consist of a pair of tweezers to eat your meal instead of your normal fork/knife haha. we had so many different tapas but some of the favorites included: fried fish chicharron snacks, the infamous el bulli olives, anchovy, tuna belly, oysters with different sauces, grilled octopus, and of course iberico ham. omg we had the best tiramisu served in the cutest half mug for dessert too!everything about our meal was amazing! the service was spot on throughout the lunch. each dish was explained to us in detail and the staff was pretty fluent in english. each dish that we had was so good too - there really was nothing that i didnt like. definitely recommend this to anyone in the barcelona area!!",
