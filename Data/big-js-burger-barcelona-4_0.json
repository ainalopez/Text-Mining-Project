    "What is it about Barcelona and their inability to make good milkshakes? \u00a0A good milkshake should be thick and almost difficult to suck through a straw. \u00a0Here at Big J's Burger, it's no different. \u00a0They've got great burgers and other food items on their menu...but their milkshakes don't bring all the boys to the yard. \u00a0The consistency is watery at best, almost like flavored milk topped with whip cream and a cherry. \u00a0The service there is excellent and they are very friendly, so that earns them an extra point, but I hope they improve their milkshake mastery.",
