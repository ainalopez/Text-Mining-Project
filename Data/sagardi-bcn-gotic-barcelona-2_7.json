    "So I should have been exhausted last Wed-night since I sat next to a crying bambino for 12+hrs; but I sucked it up... I can sleep when I'm dead?! \u00a0So I dropped my luggage at the hotel and went out with my friends. I wasn't hungry; just was craving una cupa de vino. We walked to the touristy gothic area. If I was a local, I would most likely avoid this area, but I'm a tourist, and can not help but love the area by the cathedral. We stopped here at Sagardi, because it appeared to have a popular crowd sitting outside. I didn't care for my first glass of wine; I think it was a Pinot Noir ros\u00e9. \u00a0But I did like the Rioja. \u00a0And of course, I wasn't planning on eating, but did. \u00a0I tried 3 or 4 tapas. They were ok, but my favorite was the one that looked like whited shredded cheese on top; which was actually shredded egg whites with crab. Yeah sounds weird, but I noticed every single person walking into the place, grabbing that the most. So I tried it... Me Encanta. \u00a0So for that alone my review should be at least 4 stars, but I docked a star, because of our \"not so friendly\" server (she had long hair and glasses). \u00a0Other than her being strangely rude; this place is decent for a tourist spot.",
