    "Friggin' awesome. Made the right call in asking the churro lady across the street (coincidentally also a great place) where she would go for lunch, and ended up at Mabel. It was packed but we got lucky and got two seats at the tiny 'bar' right around the beginning of almuerzo. Most patrons appeared to be local business workers or neighborhood regulars. The main draw is the three course menu (prix fixe) for about \u20ac12...and it will fill you to the gills. Between two of us, we had:- Fideua de pescado (angel hair w/ shellfish) - a crowd favorite by the looks of it and it delivered- Gazpacho: meh, but neither the hubs or I have ever been a fan so this would have been a miracle- Kebap: cooked to perfection w/ veggies- Bistec de ternera (veal): tasty and seasoned lightly so the flavor really came through- Green tea cakeService was aaaall business - prompt but didn't feel rushed, friendly with a hint of sarcasm, and really well run. One of our better decisions in Espana. If you are near here and don't mind a slight wait, GO.",
