    "Ate dinner here and also came here on a food tour. Combining 2 reviews here. Most food & white sangria-- 4 stars. Really good, not greatest we've ever had. One dish- don't know name of it, but it's melted cheese, rolled in toasted nuts, topped with a raspberry sauce... OMG YUM. 6 stars. Also, the homemade cake is phenomenal. We went to dinner at 10:30pm and had a 20 min wait. When we were seated, our waiter was super rushed and annoyed. That also knocked our experience down to 4 stars.",
