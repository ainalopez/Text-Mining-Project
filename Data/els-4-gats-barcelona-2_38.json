    "Cute place in the old Gothic District.We came here around 1:00pm for lunch and had a great experience.There is a large dining area in the back but we sat up front in the coffee shop area. It just looked more homey.We got some toasted bread with tomatoes and olive oil, some croquettes with ham, seafood soup, and a leg of lamb. Food was great and service was good as well.I would recommend going there for lunch since they have a great fixed price lunch menu.",
