    "Went to this place by accident. It was in a very touristy place, so I figured it would be overpriced and not very good. What a nice surprise! A lot of variety of tapas, you just go and choose what you want (self serve), and at the end, they count the number of toothpicks. Price is fair, at about 2 euros per piece and about 15 euros for a liter of good sangria.",
