    "Love, love, love La Plata. \u00a0Tiny, but great place - excellent food (in keeping with everyone else's reviews, they do only offer the four dishes - sardines, tomato salad, tomato bread, anchovies, and sausage). \u00a0We ordered the sardines and sausage (served with two slices tomato bread). \u00a0We've tried tapas throughout the city, and these we're the best by far. \u00a0Don't miss out on the wine - for a 2oz pour, it costs a little over 1 euro per glass. \u00a0Varieties are: red, white, and rose. \u00a0Things to note: No menus + pay at the bar.",
