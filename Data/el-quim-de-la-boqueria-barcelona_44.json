    "Am I really the first to review this place on Yelp? This is a family-run tapas bar that serves up traditional Catalan dishes(the other acclaimed competitor inside the famous Boqueria marketplace on Las Rambla is Pinotxos).Getting a seat is known to be difficult at all times, particularly if you are a party of more than two. We strategically stood behind a couple with the check in their hands, and their legs half off the stools, and were lucky enough to score seats without waiting (during our meal, I'd feel numerous tourists and locals breathing down my back, waiting for me to step down, and leaving when realizing that we were still busy). Ordering is easier than I expected; their menu comes in Catalan and English. We asked for the croquetes artesanes (de pernil ib\u00e8ric, although they also had chicken; 0.95\u20ac a piece), ous amb xipirones (fried eggs is one of \u00a0their specialties. You'll know because the staff uniform boasts a printed cartoon egg. They're also known for their tasty baby squid), and their cheapest glass of cava at 2.75\u20ac. Unfortunately, we had the fried eggs with llangueta (tiny fried fish), 18.75\u20ac, because they either really \"didn't have xipirones,\" or else got our order wrong.The food is quality, and service is friendly but slow (it's a small kitchen cooking for 18 mouths at a time, so you'd have to understand). I gave it a try because of reviews touting their clientele of renowned chefs, and their food, while pricey, did not disappoint.",
