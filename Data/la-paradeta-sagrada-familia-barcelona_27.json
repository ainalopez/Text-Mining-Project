    "My favorite seafood joint ever! The line was so long I was about to give up but really glad I did not. First when you come in, you'll buy fresh seafood such as shrimps, clams, oyster, razor clams, squid, and all kind of other seafood. Then they'll ask how you want to cook it and sauce. I got calamari fried, grilled shrimp and razor clams with their green sauce, and steamed clams. Amazing meal. The razor clams were chewy and perfectly cooked. Everything is super fresh and very casual.",
