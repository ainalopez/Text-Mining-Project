    "Modern decor, attentive service .... and fantastic Argentinian Steaks. \u00a0But don't think you'll ever walk in here without a reservation made at least a few days in advance on weekdays ... and a few weeks in advance on weekends. \u00a0The place is small, the reputation is excellent and well known ... so it's not just a destination for tourists in this upscale-hotel filled neighborhood, it's also very popular with the locals. \u00a0 Every bite is perfection. \u00a0If you don't know Spanish (or Catalonian), the staff do their best to make sure they get your order right in a most accommodating and friendly way.",
