    "Take the tasting menu. It will give a fantastic experience of what they have to offer. The combination of Brazilian flavors with Japanese ingredients, cooked in fusion style, has surprized me at every course. Service is great and the waiters all speak good English. They usually have two 'seatings', one at 21:00h and one at 23:00h. But if you want to eat at an earlier time, they are happy to serve you at 19:00h as well.",
