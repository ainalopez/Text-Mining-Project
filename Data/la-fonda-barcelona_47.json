    "The price and quality of the food you could not beat. Roaming the alley ways looking for a place to eat, we passed by this place, full house and some, we decided to check it out and we were not disappointed one bit. Their beef carpaccio with real shredded parmesan cheese, arugula and a hint of olive oil was extremely good. Next up the duck breast with honey potatoes, the meat on the duck breast just fell off, super juicy and tender. None of us had a bad dish here.",
