    "The best seafood experience I have had in my life! The ingredients are amazingly fresh and you get to pick them yourself. Everything is fantastic you should pick what you like. Personally I highly recommend trying the Norway lobster/scampi (cigalas in Spanish), razor clam, grilled baby octopus.",
