    "French style crepes in Barcelona? This is the place. It even looks like it wouldn't be out of place in Le Marais. The large windows give you a great place for people watching and the service is quick and efficient. We both went for sweet crepes, I had the chocolate and hazelnut crepe and my co-Bruncher had a banana and cream crepe. Both were delicious and rather large for the price. The staff were also in no hurry to rush you out when you were finished. Highly recommended.",
