    "I would rate the food here of 5-star quality - the only reason I'm knocking a star off is because the servers made me feel really awkward for dining solo. I have come to realize that this is a very un-European thing to do, but hey - when work travel calls, it often requires you dine solo!!Anyway, I opted for just a few appetizers and a glass of Cava. The olives were superb, and I really enjoyed the oyster with Yuzu and celery. I also ordered a croquette, which was deliciously cheesy, and the tuna belly, which was uniquely pleasing! I would definitely recommend checking this place out if your wallet warrants, but do yourself a favor and find a partner to dine with.",
