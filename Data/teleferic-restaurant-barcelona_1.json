    "Seriously this place was such a great find! We were looking to done in a pintxos bar but lunch time had most places swarming with people so we stumbled upon this small cafe and decided to wing it. The pintxos were terrific and had a modern flare to them. I believe this place one tapa of the year at some point (?) I love that you serve yourself there with them (keeps the original tradition alive! Just like in San Sebastian). They also have a full menu for real food if you're uber hungry. And everything on it looks delicious. The service was superb, A+ for such a pleasant experience!",
