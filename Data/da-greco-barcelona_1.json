    "The best meal we've had in Barcelona. Everything was perfect. The ambiance is extraordinary, the service impeccable, the food delicious and the price fair. We loved it. The restaurant is very small reservations are a good idea. You have to ring a doorbell to have them open the door for you. Once in, the restaurant feels more like a living room than a business. A great experience.",
