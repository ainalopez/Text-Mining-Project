    "This restaurant was around the corner from our hotel, and came highly recommended from the hotel staff. \u00a0Thank goodness we followed their advice! \u00a0Such a cute little place- casual but elegant decor. \u00a0There is minimal seating for an intimate feel, tables can be hard to come by but worth the wait. \u00a0We ordered a variety of tapas and loved everything- I particularly enjoyed the tuna tartar. \u00a0The wine was also excellent. \u00a0Staff was great and were very helpful with recommendations for food and drink. \u00a0This restaurant is located close to the Arc de Triomfe.",
