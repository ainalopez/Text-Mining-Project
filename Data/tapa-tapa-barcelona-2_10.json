    "Definitely is one of the nicer Tapas places in the area. The food is great though and definitely try the Cava Sangria, it will be worth it. The servers are nice, a bit hard to get a hold of at times and you really have to stay on top of them otherwise they will forget things. That seems to be a barcelona thing though. It's great to sit outside at night and watch people haggle with the street sellers of fake bags. Overall, we had a great time and enjoyed some great food and I would recommend you check it out if you are in the area.",
