    "This was our least favorite dinner on our entire trip to Barcelona. I believe \"Taller De Tapas\" does well because of the location- not the food. The food came out very quickly and not very warm. It didn't taste fresh and was very bland (the salt on the table couldn't save it) it also seemed re-heated and greasy. I cannot honestly recommend a single dish. The prices are too high for such low quality! Head outside this tourist zone- there is great food in this city, just not here. -Also- There is a 15% additional charge to eat outside (we ate indoors)",
