    "I really like the system of ordering where you walk in and they have a menu printed up with check marks that you complete and had to the person at the counter. This is a great way to make sure there are not translation errors in the order. Of course this is a burger place and they are fantastic, huge, well cooked, and so filling that most of the people at my table couldn't finish their food. I would highly recommend this place.",
