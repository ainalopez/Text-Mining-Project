    "My friend kept telling me to go here so I finally went and yes the prices are that cheap (a relief in Barcelona!) but was it the best sandwich I've ever had??? No. I ordered the steak and asked the guy to put whatever he thought was great on the sandwich and it was just OK. I would go there again for the prices but is it a must-go, must-have place? Not really. My funny moment was when I thought the guy asked me if I \"wanted cheese\" and when I said yes, he charged me a euro and didn't give me any cheese. Then I realized he asked if I \"wanted A SEAT.\" Oh silly me. But seriously don't sit in there, its like a sauna.",
