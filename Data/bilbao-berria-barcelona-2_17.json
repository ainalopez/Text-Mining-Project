    "Great experience with trying good tapas at this place! We came for lunch with friends and were lucky enough to get a table outside. ALL of the different tapas we tried were excellent! There's so many options that all looked good. It was hard to choose which ones to get. The prices here were also great. We left very happy and full. I can't wait to go back!",
