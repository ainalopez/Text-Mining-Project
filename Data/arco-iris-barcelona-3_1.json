    "Excellent restaurant with great vegetarian food. Well located and with a great menu of the day. Food was fresh, and came quickly. There was a great variety of original dishes on the menu. No matter what we chose it tasted delicious. Great soups, bread, biscuits, and olive oil. Chickpeas were amazing, well spiced, and very flavourful. Owner was friendly and told us a lot about Barcelona. Would definitely come back again.",
