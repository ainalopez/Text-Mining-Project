    "They don't speak English but we had a great time anyways! It is a tiny little restaurant with 3 tables and a mini bar area. Don't bring more than 2-4 people because you won't fit. Their drinks were delicious and their food was amazing. Very authentic Mexican food. Even with the language barrier, we had a great time! (Even though they might've been laughing AT us, not WITH us)",
