    "Hands down the best tapas bar I've been too in my whole time at Spain. My tour group came here, and the tour guide mentioned it is Michelin starred! The seating, though cramped, offered opportunity to talk to other people in my group. There were 4 tapas offered--the traditional tomato and olive oil bread was soft and delicious. The potatas Braves with garlic sauce was EXCELLENT--crispy and seasoned well. And the these fried sticks of meat and cheese(? I think? I do not remember what it's called), but it was also heavenly on every bite. There was another tapa with pork pieces seasoned in an interesting spice--not my favorite but still yummy. The tapas, like any, were small, but you can tell that so much thought went into every bite. It was delicious and I highly recommend!",
