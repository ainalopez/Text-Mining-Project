    "After establishing a good baseline at Cerveceria Catalana, we went here for more Tapas in the evening. There was a line outside but after about 5mins we were offered seats at the bar. After getting the menus and such we ordered a Bomba, the Iberian ham croquettes, the bikini sandwich and the chicken wings (and a round of chicken croquettes afterwards). The Iberian ham croquettes were miles better than the ones at Cerveceria Catalana, the bomba was really nice too. The chicken wings were sadly a bit too salty. Both my gf and I agreed the bikini sandwich was completely dominated by the black truffle flavour which ruined it. The fruit juices, while on the expensive side, were good too.The next day we returned around noon to try out a few more things and revisit some of our favourites (bomba and ham croquettes). We then ordered the deep fried potatoes with egg and iberian ham (yum), the bread with tomatoes (simple but brilliant) and some deep fried baby squid (really good too). I'd definitely go here again next time I am in Barcelona.",
