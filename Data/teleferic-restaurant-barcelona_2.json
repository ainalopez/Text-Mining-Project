    "This restaurant works like one of those sushi restaurants in Los Angeles where you take as many plates you want to eat and then they add them all up at the end. One exception here is that I never saw them put out new food in the couple hours I was here. The plates are like small hors d'oeuvres or tapas that look good but appear to have been sitting out for hours. The plates are divided by ones that can be eaten without heating and ones that need to be reheated. The calamari had a stinky smell so I decided to stay away from the other raw seafood/ raw meat dishes. That said, the foie gras dish was decent as well as the cheese stuffed eggplant dish. Great idea but... I don't love the idea of eating food that's been sitting out and needing to be reheated.",
