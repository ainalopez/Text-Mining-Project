    "We wandered by in the early evening and heard a sound check for live music. That was enough to get our attention and so we headed in for a beer. The man behind the bar was very friendly and we learned that the music would start at 9:30 and it was free! It's a very tiny place with the stage in the back, but there are a bunch of tables outside. We didn't have any food, but the falafel sure looked amazing.",
