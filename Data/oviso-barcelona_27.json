    "Great place with fresh ingredients and very very good cortado! We had the best breakfast/brunch there. It is located at the Orwell placa close to La Rambla and a lot of cool shops. We sat in the sun and had the best start of the day, there are children playing at the placa and such a good feeling everywhere. If you go to Barcelona you definitely have to go there! And the pricing is very reasonable! #lovebarcelona",
