    "More Cantabrian anchovies (with olives), more cold beer, more tomato bread, Spanish ham croquettes (fine), Andalusian-style squid (lightly floured, fried, served with lemon - the least impressive seafood we had), and the Iberian tasting (5J Jam\u00f3n, Iberian cured pork loin, Iberian chorizo) - all of it was good but salty and this kind of eating exhausts a palate. We were only in it for the tapas here, but it didn't seem like there were enough fresh vegetables on menus anywhere in Barcelona. We were also sitting outside and I could see directly into the kitchen. One of the workers removed the portafilter holder from the espresso machine and banged it against a dirty plastic garbage can - when that did not satisfy him, he reached into the same garbage can and found a plastic bag that he used to wipe the inside of the portafilter holder that he then reattached to the machine. Our plates were good, not great, but I have to round down because of that episode in the kitchen. 2.4 stars.",
