    "This is not a single place, rather is an aggregation of different places under the same roof.We ended up by eating at la braseria. first restaurant on the right, as it was the only one having free space.So, what can we tell about it?We ordered a burger and a tartare, and for both of them it was really below the OK level. Tartare was presented with nachos on top, and that was quite not what I was looking for. Burger instead come out quite empty (damn, I hate when the meat is presented just as itself, only the brown meat in a white plate, it just does look as bad as it sounds). Its quality was.. so and so, I was expecting much more but it was not really well cooked. I asked for a rare burger, and what I received was something raw in the middle and overcooked on the outside... No I'm sorry, that's not what I expect from a steakhouse, I asked for it to be rare not raw&overcooked! Turn down that flame, please!Dessert, I asked for cheese and marmalade hoping for something homemade but instead I received supermarket cheese with factory orange marmalade... no thanks! especially for the price!My suggestion for the braseria is \"stay away from it\", but again, there are several other places here, so it may be worth to check out the other restaurants!",
