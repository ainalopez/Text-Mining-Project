    "Excellent food, great price, phenomenal service! My girlfriend and I were scootering around Barcelona for the day, and when we got hungry the positive yelp reviews lead us to Tucco. We were looking for a reasonably priced lunch that would fill us up. If that's what you're looking for this place is ideal! With each meal you get bread, a beverage (beer, wine, soft drink), and a dessert! Everything is homemade and you can really tell by the quality. Apart from the great food, the service here definitely makes you feel welcome and appreciated! Our waitress (who I believe was one of the owners) gave us a wonderful breakdown of the menu, and afterwards was even kind enough to recommend some local spots to visit!Thank you very much for a great experience!",
