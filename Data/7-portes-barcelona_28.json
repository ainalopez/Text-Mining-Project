    "We had a few bites at Can Paixano around the corner and b/c it was so crowded, we decided to look around for a restaurant that served paella. Mistake #1! We should've just feasted to our stomachs content at Paixano. We asked the owner(?) and other bar patrons for suggestions on where to go, and they really couldn't come up with any! Do locals not eat paella?Well the owner ended up suggesting this place b/c he didn't know of another, which really should've been the first clue to not go. Ignorant/stubborn tourists we are, we decided to grab a table seated outside (Mistake #2). We ordered a cannelloni, truffle ravioli, \"rich man's\" paella, and held off on ordering the profiteroles until after we ate. Oh my goodness... so many things wrong, where to start?-There was absolutely NO truffle flavor in the ravioli, good thing we didn't order the truffle cannelloni-The paella was soooo salty and the sparse seafood was all super overcooked/mushy-We got charged for \"pa\" and when we asked what the charge was, they then took it off... Shady! Btw, \"pa\" was the bread, that's put at the table when you're seated.-On the way to the bathroom, my gf overheard another table's waiter ask \"how was your paella?\" the response was \"this was terrible\"! Oh my goodness, at least we left politely :)Needless to say, we didn't order the profiteroles and we stopped hunting for paella.",
