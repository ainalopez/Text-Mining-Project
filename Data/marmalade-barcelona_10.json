    "I came here on a night when walking sounded better than eating. With all the sights of Barcelona, I was too caught up seeing things, and eventually found it was quite late and I was quite hungry. What to do?The right answer was a trip to Marmalade for dinner. I had BBQ ribs -- not a Barcelona specialty, but a really filling meal when I needed it. As a solo diner, I felt comfortable, and light conversation with other customers was a nice benefit. My food was good, but not spectacular. However, I came back a couple days later for breakfast! Breakfast was great -- the coffee was perfect, and my eggs were just right. There's a pleasant patio, and the servers are less hungover than the customers - so they are ready to help. Definitely stop in for breakfast, and good for dinner if you're nearby.",
