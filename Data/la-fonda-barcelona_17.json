    "The paella here was very good and reasonably priced (7.9EUR/person for mixed paella), with flavorful rice and moist seafood. It was soupier than most paella I've had, but the texture of the dish was still good. \u00a0The other dishes we ordered were completely unappetizing.* Stewed baby octopus with onions - 9.6EUR * Grilled entrecote steak with vegetables and fries - 10.9EURI recommend skipping everything besides the paella if you do eat here. The white tablecloth atmosphere was a bit stuffy compared to most of the places we ate in Barcelona. Service wasn't very good either.",
