    "One of the most enjoyable meals I can remember in several months. The raw bar selection was unbelievable. My pallet got all the satisfactions of a great sushi experience all in a Spanish Tapas environment. Some of my favorites were: live jumbo oysters, live sea snails, live scallop, cuttlefish in cuttle ink, tuna sashimi, spicy mayo potatoes, live razor clams and fresh local octopus carpaccio.",
