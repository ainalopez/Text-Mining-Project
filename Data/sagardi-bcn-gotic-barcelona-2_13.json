    "Pinxtos? \u00a0Pinch me! \u00a0If you've grown weary of communicating in another language, American Tourist, I've discovered the antidote: \u00a0Sagardi's huge counter covered with delicious food. \u00a0Just point and grunt, and it will be yours. \u00a0And it is to DIE for. \u00a0There's a lot of fish in Basque tapas (aka, pinxtos), but if you like seafood, you're in for a treat. \u00a0There are several Sagardi locations, but this one is in the Gothic Quarter, near the Picasso Museum and Santa Maria Del Mar.A few pointers: \u00a01)That's not tofu. \u00a0It's fish cake. 2) Tuna stuffing is common with this kind of food. \u00a0So don't be surprised if your veggie has fish filling.3) The olive, pepper and anchovy on a stick is a regional specialty called a Gilda and I know it sounds freaky, but it is daaayum good. \u00a0I think you should try it. \u00a04) You're supposed to throw your napkin on the floor when you're done with it. \u00a0Just go with it. \u00a0Your mom won't find out.",
