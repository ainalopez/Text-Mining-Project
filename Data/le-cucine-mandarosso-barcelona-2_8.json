    "I ate here in early May 2015 with my husband and parents. \u00a0The restaurant is very 'chef-y': unique menu items, high quality ingredients, no doubt a hipster eccentric culinary graduate running the kitchen. \u00a0We were definitely relegated to the tourist area of the restaurant. \u00a0We were made to feel like outsiders while locals were seated in a secret back section. \u00a0Food was good and decor has a fun retro vibe.",
