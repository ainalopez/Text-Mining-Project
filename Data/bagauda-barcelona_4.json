    "Good tapas bar. I had the local cheese board and a glass or Wine. They were not accepting credit cards when I was there so I had to run out for cash. The service was good and Polite. It is in a tourist neighbourhood but it is not too touristy which is nice. Prices are about average for Barcelona . \u20ac8 for the cheese plate and &\u20ac3 or \u20ac4 for a glass of wine.",
