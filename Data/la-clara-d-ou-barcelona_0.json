    "Our first night in Barcelona was meant to be a very mellow and unplanned evening to ease ourselves in to the trip. After visiting the magic fountain of Montju\u00efc's we set off in search of a nice simple restaurant before we headed back to the hotel and stumbled upon La Clara. We snuggled up to the bar (the football was on after all) and ordered a glass of vino tinto (red wine) and several tapas dishes. Every dish was better than the last and we left extremely satisfied and even more excited for the next culinary adventure in Barcelona. The staff was really friendly and accommodating to the Spanish speaking challenged couple that we are. Coming from San Francisco where we're not spoiled for choice on high quality, Michelin restaurants we were pleasantly surprised at how well prepared and delicious everything was. Highly recommended!",
