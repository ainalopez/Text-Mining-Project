    "I went there with my family and the food was really good. I had eggs Benedict with salmon, homemade fries and salad and a lemonade. The poached eggs were on point and the fries were perfectly crunchy. The lemonade had the perfect amount of sugar in it and was really good. The only thing is that it doesn't open before 11 am which is sometimes a little late for breakfast but other wise I would totally recommend it to go there when in Barcelona!",
