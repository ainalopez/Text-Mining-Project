    "Restaurant was pleasant and the menu very appealing. I had the gazpacho which was amazing and a salad with pumpkin and tempeh which was very good but not amazing. The service was ok but a bit distracted. Overall a very good experience that I would repeat. \u00a0For vegetarians in Barcelona this is a very fresh joint with integrity.",
