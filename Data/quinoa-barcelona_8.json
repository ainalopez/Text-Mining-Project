    "Very fresh vegetarian food in Gracia. The smoothie was made right in front of me and tofu burger was delicious. I came in on my own and sat at the bar and the staff was very attentive and spoke English. Only con is that portions are a little small (as is the restaurant itself). Otherwise, strongly recommend.Ps - they are very passionate about being vegetarian - wifi password is meat is murder :)",
