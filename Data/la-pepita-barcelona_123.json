    "So. Good. We had to eat here twice. Couldn't find a bad thing on the menu. Definitely get one of the specialty pepitas: we tried the napolitana, bikini, tuna, and the traditional sausage - all delicious. For tapas, the calamari with kimchi aioli was awesome. Very reasonably priced, excellent and friendly service, great atmosphere. Go. Eat.",
