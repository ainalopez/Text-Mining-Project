    "We stopped in to have some pre-dinner drinks and were a little disappointed. For being on the strip and specializing in wine, my Rioja was not the best I have ever had to say the least. It was fairly priced however. My boyfriend got beer here and the beer was twice as expensive as the wine--an outrage in my opinion, especially when it is fairly crappy light beer! Would not suggest this, the only saving grace was the fire lamps in the outdoor seating area.",
