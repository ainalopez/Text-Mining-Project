    "We stopped by here for a quick bite while trekking up to the Parc Guell. We were looking for another place recommended by the Lonely Planet Spain guidebook but according to one of the other businesses in the square, that place was no longer there. We think it may have been replaced by this place... I got a frankfurter and according to the menu in English, it was the \"best hot dog in Barcelona.\" I never believe such claims anyway and that was certainly not why I ordered it. Maybe I was feeling a little homesick... I didn't find the other menu choices to be particularly appealing. My friend got the patatas bravas, which were pretty good. The main problem was that our food all came at separate times. My friend who got the potatoes got them first and was basically finished by the time I got my hot dog. My other two friends did not get their bikinis until I was almost halfway through with my hot dog. The place seems like one of the cheaper options on that square, so it'll do in a bind I suppose. But the food was just okay and the service was not that great. Our waiter was very nice-- he didn't speak a whole lot of English but we were able to get by okay. The main problem really was that all our food came out at different times with 10-15 minute waits in between.",
