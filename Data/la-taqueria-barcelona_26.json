    "My friends and I have searched high an low to find decent Mexican here in Barcelona, and this place is defiantly one of the best.Its a very chilled out place with very friendly staff. The food is very authentic (i.e. not tex-mex). The nacho's were fairly good and came with beans, chili's, cheese, onion etc as the standard topping. The food is served on plastic plates along with a variety of sauces. Just be careful of the spicy salsa's as they are very very spicy (much to the amusement of my friends)",
