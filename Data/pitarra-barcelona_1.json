    "Nice place with old and long tradition. From outside you can find a lot of diploma and recommendations.Inside it looks like and quite old room with wardrobes, clocks and old pictures.Service is rather too noble. They can make you feel uncomfortable and a little overwhelmed.We've tried launch menu.The good thing is that you \u00a0receive a full bottle of wine, and around half of the bottle is included, so this is a lot more than one glass of wine.Wine was ok, similar to the simple house wines.Fish soup was very good, but the second plate not quite.This should be grilled steak, but I've received very thin meat (5mm) which looked like chicken breast.There was almost a half of it fat and not eat-able part of the meat. Potatoes was not enough cooked and full of oil.That is why only 3* - tradition is not everything.",
