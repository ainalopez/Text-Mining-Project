    "Came here for dinner on Christmas Day with my family. They had a fixed menu of several courses that we knew about ahead of time. Eating here was a lovely experience...maybe it was quiet just because it was Xmas and people were at home, but we could actually hear each other across the table. Decor is simple and elegant. Food was incredible, just the right portion sizes. Best meal of our trip so far!",
