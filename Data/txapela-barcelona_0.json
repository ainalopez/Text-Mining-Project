    "This is my favourite place for montaditos/pinxos/mini sandwiches!Aways when someone is visiting me in Bcn we go there at least once :)There are places with this kind of food where each piece costs 1\u20ac, Txapela is a bit more expensive around 2-2.5\u20ac for good just made hot montadito, but the quality never disappointed me.The variety is quite big and the food arrives very fast, so you can start with several and then keep ordering if you are still hungry.On average 6-8 montaditos per person is enough.I love all chicken ones, beef, brie, the mini bravas and they also offer good sizes of beer and sangria.",
