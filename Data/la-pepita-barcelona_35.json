    "This is my second time back at the restaurant. The food is still as good as I remembered. Ordered the croquette with Iberian ham (good), golden pepita (ok), bikini pepita (ok), beef cheeks (good), sea bass with strawberries (good) and orujo (good). I'm giving it a four instead of a 5 and here why....I wish they would not let people write on the windows. When I was last there the window was clear and it gave a really good ambience to the restaurant. Now I feel like I am eating inside a resto full of grafittis. The server was very friendly and service was fast. Overall we enjoyed our dinner there!",
