    "Came here with my family a few nights before Christmas. This place got great reviews so I'm disappointed to report that our experience was sub par. The restaurant is teeming with waiters, but we were completely neglected. We would ask for more water and get it about three tapas dishes later. The cheeseboard was fine and the fish was okay, but the 52 euro steak was rock hard and a complete salt bomb. When we got the check, we discovered that they had charged us for a dish we didn't order, and had charged us for two bottles of wine rather than two glasses. We left in a hurry and won't be back.",
