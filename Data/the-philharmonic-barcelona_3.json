    "We strolled into this place randomly because it was close to our hotel and we wanted to watch a World Cup game and we couldn't have made a better choice. This place is fun, great atmosphere and the staff is awesome. The owners have a great story and background and it's just a great time. The bar is a great space and everyone should come here and get a drink.",
