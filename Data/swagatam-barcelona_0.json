    "Lovely Indian restaurant in the Gracia district, conveniently located next to a craft beer pub. After going two months without Indian food, this place was everything I needed and more. I ordered the chicken tikka masala with saag paneer and a double order of garlic naan. The food came out so quickly and our server was super friendly :))",
