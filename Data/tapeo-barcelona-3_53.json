    "Awesome place for great tapas and wine too! The food is simply marvelous. We ordered five different plates and they were all excellent. Especially noteworthy are the pork ribs and the broken eggs with morcilla (their English translation of the name of the dish). My wife said that it was the best morcilla that she has ever tasted anywhere. Being so close to the Museo Picasso this is a great place to eat before or after visiting the museum.",
