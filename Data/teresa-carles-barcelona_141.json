    "I'm not even close to calling myself a vegetarian, but Teresa Carles became a favourite dining spot during my time in Barcelona. Delicious wholesome breakfasts, lucious fresh juices, wonderful mains, and so many refreshing desserts. It's modern and was a great way to have a break from all the meat heavy tapas I was devouring. Give it a go, at least for breakfast :)",
