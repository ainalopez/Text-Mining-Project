    "My friend and i came here twice during our short trip to Barcelona. You literally have to fight your way in just to order food because of the crowd. We came here on a night when it downpoured \u00a0and \u00a0there was still a line outside. It seems like theyre always packed no matter what time it is. \u00a0But this cozy, small restaurant is 100% worth the hype and hands down my favorite tapas bar that we've tried while we were there. We tried a few dishes, but the salmon with yogurt & drizzled honey was my favorite. I would go there just to eat these again.",
