    "Wine was very good but there was only three types (pink, red, and white). If I go to a wine bar I want to try many different wines. But the atmosphere was fun. Small with a small selection of good tasting tapas. The older gentleman of the neighborhood were sitting around arguing with the owner which is very traditional of spain. Definetly a must see but dont expect to spend a lot of time there.",
