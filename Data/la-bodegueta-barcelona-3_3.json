    "Recommended by friends, we visited la bodegueta twice in five days in Barcelona. Classic tapas in a great setting. First visit we sat in the front bar area and scarfed down every tapas suggested by our terrific waiter. We snagged an outside table the second visit and were equally thrilled. Clams, shrimp in garlic, patatas bravas, on and on. Lots of locals.....",
