    "I think the hours posted are off - we went at 4 and 5 pm on a Thursday and it was closed, but it was open when we checked again at 6:30. \u00a0In short, it was worth wandering around for hours on La Rambla and Barri Gotic to try this place. \u00a0There are no menus, but there are only 4 different tapas offered and 3 different wines. \u00a0The wines are served in small drink glasses, and cost slightly more than 1 euro each. \u00a0There is a red wine, a white wine, and a rose - we tried the red and rose and were happy with both. \u00a0There are 4 choices in terms of food - a plate of salad (tomato, onion, olives with olive oil, 2 anchovies), a small plate of fried fish (looks exactly like Taiwanese style fried smelt, lightly battered and deep fried whole), a plate of bruschetta which looked like it had the tomato juice rubbed directly onto the bread, and a sausage on a small piece of toast. \u00a0The sausage didn't seem overly fatty and was well flavored. \u00a0The bruschetta was my least favorite, because I'm not such a big fan of bread, but I really enjoyed everything else - very simply fresh and delicious. \u00a0We had a great dinner here at a great price - 4 plates of fresh food and 2 cups of wine for a total of less than 12 euros for 2 people! \u00a0I fully recommend skipping the overpriced tourist trap places on La Rambla and walking over to this tiny hole in the wall place in the Barri Gotic.",
