    "Definitely a tourist drop in, but very good. Prices are high and portions are small, but the food is tasty and served hot. Do not waste your time on the Sangria, it is overpriced and ok. (If you like it, go to the grocery store and buy a whole bottle for $2E). The staff is stiff, but the service was good and speedy.",
