    "We ate at Bar Mut on a recommendation from our local guide, he was very friendly and didn't want to send us to a tourist trap, we were SO HAPPY. The service was excellent and the food was spectacular. I struggled a bit with the language challenge, be aware they do not have a lot of english speakers but that's OK!! They were so kind and responsive even with the language barrier. I didn't drink the wine so I can't speak to that, but the steak tar tar was my favorite dish, and we had the clams and muscles, I was definitely surprised by how flavorful everything was, it was an excellent balance. Excellent restaurant, local experience!",
