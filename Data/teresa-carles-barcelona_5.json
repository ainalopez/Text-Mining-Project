    "Atmosphere 5/5- hipster high end candle lit, nice for a dateService 4/5Food/price 2/5As a vegetarian that's had some good vegan food (I.e San Francisco, even my home town Pittsburgh!) before I was not impressed by the food despite all the rave reviews. Granted I had pretty high expectations coming in.Server was great in squeezing us in despite a lot of reservations that night, we were seated immediately at 7pm on a Wednesday. He also offered to take our family's picture. I give service 4/5 due to slow pacing of meals and waiting forever to get our check- they seem too busy for the amount of staff they have!Food- all vegan.We had the mezze platter to start. Impressive look when coming out but I only really enjoyed the fried cauliflower and olive tamponade spread- everything else was kind of bland and disappointing.Entrees- my family ordered the tofu salmon, the black rice, and the mar and mountain (seitan meatballs). We split it all 3 ways. Tofu salmon was mediocre in flavor but filing. Black rice was a nice chewiness but really are just laying 13 euros for black rice?? Then my mar and mountain was pretty flavorless 'meat' balls (just 6 small ones in a pyramid) in a bed of brown sauce with some greens. I've had better meatless balls frozen from trader joes. Overall just no great flavors here and definitely falls short of the price point.Tax is 10%. In Barcelona you can tip 5-10% max at a sit down dinner Per our guidebook.",
