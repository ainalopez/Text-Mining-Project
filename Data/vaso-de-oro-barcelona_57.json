    "When you find yourself wandering over for some sun and sand in Barceloneta, you need to eat here. \u00a0This place is crowded, small, and that is part of the charm of Vaso de Oro. \u00a0You will be rubbing elbows with plenty of locals and you will experience some amazing tapas. \u00a0My wife and I stumbled in here and spent some time just enjoying some amazing food. \u00a0The thing that blew us away was the foie gras a la plancha. \u00a0This was an amazing chunk of fattened liver put on the stovetop with a bunch of onions. \u00a0It sounds simple (and it was) but it was also amazing on top of a piece of bread. \u00a0It was actually so good we got seconds. \u00a0A visit to Vaso de Oro will feed your afternoon food cravings and create some great memories as well.",
