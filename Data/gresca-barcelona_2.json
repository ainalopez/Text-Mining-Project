    "UNDERWHELMING- I don't understand what all these yelpers are raving on about. Our hotel made our reservation for 9pm we got there & it was empty. Considering every other fantastic restaurant we've been to has been full, we were really shocked.We went for the 9 course classic tasting menu and whilst we have to commend the chef on presentation and the technical side of the cooking - the flavours were really lacking. A lot of the flavours simply didn't stand out or were too hidden, some things just didn't compliment each other. The pi\u00f1a colada was the biggest disappointment - it was pretty much tasteless. The chocolate and olive oil didn't work either, there was too much bitterness and barely any sweetness. The pigeon was cooked well but again there was just something lacking in flavour. Nothing really jumped out at us. Everything was just ok. If we would've paid \u20ac60 for our meal instead of \u20ac140 then maybe we wouldn't have such a negative opinion but in all honesty the food here is simply not worth this price.In addition - Whilst we were there the ambience was dead - two couples with reservations walked in and back out because the atmosphere was so awkward inside. And even by the end of the night with just another 4 tables seated \u00a0it was still really dull.Considering Barcelona has so many other cool and delicious restaurants - I wouldn't recommend Gresca as one to come to.",
