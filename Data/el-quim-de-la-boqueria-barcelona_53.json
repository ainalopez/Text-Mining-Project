    "My wife and I were in Spain for about ten days, and ate so much amazing food, but El Quim de la Boqueria is the only place we went to twice (and we tried to go another time, but they were closed). I had read things about this place on Yelp and other sites before I went, but seeing the food and the crowded booth made me even more excited to go. The first time we went, we had the baby squid with white beans and the prawns with garlic, and both tasted super fresh and super delicious. When we went back, we had the prawns with eggs, the BocaQUIM sandwich and the botifarra. Again, everything was amazing! Probably the best shrimp we had during our whole time there, but El Quim also just really knows how to cook eggs REALLY WELL. If we had time for a third meal there, we really wanted to try one of their wild mushroom dishes, their razor clams, and some of their daily special stew-like dishes served with bread, which all looked really good as well. Definitely worth stalking a stool and waiting for a seat.",
