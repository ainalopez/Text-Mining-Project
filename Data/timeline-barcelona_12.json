    "Timeline is the \"BOMB\" thanks Yelpsters for the tip. Walked \u00a0in as they opened on \"Shitty Sunday\" no reservation? No problem. Mini hamburgers, Avocado,corn,cherry tomato salad, the best pineapple ginger mojito's and killer bloodies. Great atmosphere. The place quickly got packed for brunch. This place was a true \"find\" I'll be back.",
