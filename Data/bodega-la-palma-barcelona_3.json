    "Last stop of the \"Taste of Barcelona\" tour was formerly an ice house where people would sit around as your block of ice was chiseled away for you. Damn those fridges which ruined that trade. Barrels line up the top entrance which makes it look like a winery which is a great visual clue to the secret sommelier that's local to the venue. Great variety of wines are offered and I noticed bottles rose wines ordered on both sides. I chose the cava and closely recognized that they are detailed in the temperature of your beverage being served and stored. Unique bottle ice wraps resembled something an athlete puts on their ankle to prevent swelling. Bring on the desserts ! Ice creams are made in house. The French toast looking item is only served at Easter in Catalonia, however, you can find it here. Chocolate cake was warm and would compliment a bold red. Our experience here was delightful. Book your taste so you too can experience everything first hand. Dave was fantastic ! The Barcelona Tastethebarcelonataste.comcontact@thebarcelonatast\u2026--------------------------",
