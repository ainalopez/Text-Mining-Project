    "Yum! Great beer and great food. No one working at the time of our one visit seemed to speak English, but thankfully they had an English menu. The potato app was good and the burgers were pretty tasty too. They had a nice craft beer selection and for the prices we saw in Barcelona, it seemed very reasonable.",
