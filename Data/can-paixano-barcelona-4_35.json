    "This place is AMAZING!I went on a western Europe travel on the whim and planned a visit to Madrid and Barca as part of it. My friend lived in Barcelona at the time so of course I stayed with her and she showed me around.Of course we went to the Boqueria.. and one day she asked if I wanted great tasting cava that's sold by the bottle for like 3 euros and yummy fatty foods. UHHH OBVIOUSLY!It's easily missed since it's like a hole in the wall but it's worth it! Upon seeing this place, I was a little apprehensive about how crowded it was at like 3 PM and wondering how I would get my food and drinks and where to eat.. but oh boy was I excited! Lots of cured meats and cheese.. you can get cava (red kind is what we got) by the glass or bottle.. but hello.. just get it by the bottle!Come with friends.. share bottles of wine and get lots of tapas!",
