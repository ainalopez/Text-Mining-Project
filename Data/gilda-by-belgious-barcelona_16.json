    "Outstanding service. The owner Michael greeted us and was clearly passionate about his food and his place. Great ambiance with exceptional and unique food. Tapas with a Belgian/Argentine twist. Definitely try the ceviche. It's the best I've had in Barcelona and it pairs well with the Belgian beer on tap. If you're looking for a good wine, ask Michael for a recommendation, he was quite knowledgeable about the local wines.",
