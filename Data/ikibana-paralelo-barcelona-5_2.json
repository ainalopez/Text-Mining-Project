    "Today we had a bad experience at this restaurant... Unfortunately, disappoint starts from the enter. The staff is a real mess, food was average, except the rice and sake, and the most awful thing is the dirty interior - everywhere you can see dust on the design wood pieces and I did saw a spider web... Definitely will never visit this place again, 'cos it's not worth the money to spend in.",
