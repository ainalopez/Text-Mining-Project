    "On my First family trip to Barcelona, we had been looking for a place to grab a drink with dinner and just so happened to (LUCKILY!) pass by this restaurant. Looked fairly modern from the outside so we ventured in. We shared some lovely tapas (foie gras, mixed cheese, sliced meats, mixed salad and a turkey sandwich). The waitress helping us also spoke fluent english (not easy to find in Barcelona- in my experience) and was very pleasant to us throughout the night. Highly recommended. Would definitely visit again on my next trip.",
