    "This tiny spot is nothing short of amazing. No fanciness, (although I do covet the tiles on the wall). This tiny spot in the heart of Barcelona's Gothic Quarter is a must go to travel destination for all true foodies. MAD RESPECT for a place that only offers 4 plates, and they do the 4 simply, and with perfection! The fried whole small fish are gutted and cleaned, then fried whole and seasoned. You shove the entire thing in your pie hole and down your gullet. No whining allowed regarding the head and the bones. The fish is so small it is unnoticeable! Also did not know that a simple salad of tomato, onion, olives, and olive oil could be THIS damn good. (Wifey and I are debating whether it is the quality of the EVOO or the produce). The other 2 tapas offered is a pan con tomate, (nice bread slice with tomato rubbed on it), topped with a very nice anchovy, nothing like the nasty ones from a can in the US. The other is the same aforementioned bread with a \"Butifarra,\" the local available everywhere Catalonian sausage. Deliciousness!You further will be hard pressed to find house wines this good anywhere. We had the house red and were delighted that it was mildly chilled. The pour it right out of a barrel and into a 750ml bottle that is set at your table. Trust me, everywhere in Barcelona that this is done, they know exactly how many \"copas\" you've had, so don't worry if you don't want the entire bottle as we consumed. Cannot say enough great things about this place!",
