    "We had an acceptable service. We ordered a paella for two after several recommendations. It was a good paella but a bit pricey for what we got. I had better while staying in Barcelona. \u00a0I believe the price includes the fact that a celebrity sat at your table. I sat where Che sat... Mixed feelings about that. Their olive oil oh yes! The best thing I tried at \u00a07 Porte. What an amazing olive oil. So fruity and strong. Star of the dinner.",
