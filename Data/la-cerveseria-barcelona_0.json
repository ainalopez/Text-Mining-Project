    "La Cervesaria:Fantastic joint. Acceptable with both friends and family.Facts about the author of this review:I have an incredibly hard to please step-mother. Now that you know the facts, know this: there were four of us, and there were four options on the 'menu' (the legit menu, like \"order this and get a meal menu\"). Two of the eight dishes got a \"oh, that's interesting\" comment from the step-mom, which is the equivalent of a 5-star rating from that asshole on Hell's Kitchen. Those dishes were the Spinach Lasagne and the salad with nuts and pear. They were indeed delicious. And in my own rating system (in which it is easier to do well) the cheesecake, pork, sepia, and beer were also very good.",
