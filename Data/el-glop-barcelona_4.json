    "Absolutely amazing. I took my parents here based on yelp reviews and El Glop did not disappoint. The ambiance, staff, \u00a0and clientele are authentically Catalan, professional, and friendly. I ate steamed mussels and grilled chicken with white beans that were heavenly, though we noticed half of the tables there eating paella. The menu is simple- grilled meats and fish, paellas, tapas and salads. Local wines are inexpensive and portions are generous. I'll definitely be back for paella.",
