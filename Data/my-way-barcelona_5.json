    "Delicious food, in a small street off La Rambla found it by chance, and what a lucky strike. The place is very quaint, the service is excellent and the most delicious food so far in Barcelona. Our waiter, Pablo, an Argentine, could not have been nicer. We started with the fried calamares and the pimientos Padron, so good. I had the Risotto with mushroom and my husband the Solomillo Angus ( steak) done to perfection and so very tender. Desert cream Catalana. We don't drink alcohol, though they offered us and after dinner drink. We will try to go back before we leave.",
