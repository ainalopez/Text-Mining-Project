    "Great place for Sunday brunch! There is a nice choice of combo plates specifically for brunch, at a reasonable price. As the name says, it is good to try eggs benedict which can be accompanied by different food, like salmon, bacon or mozzarella. It gets full soon so better go there early, or book, if you are a large group of people.",
