    "Completely not touristy, delicious tapas place that opens at 1:30 pm (and they are puzzled if you are hovering at the door before that). \u00a0Didn't see another tourist group come in on the Friday we were there for Tapas---four sets of locals, though--including one group with a 4 year old boy---and our kids really liked the food too, so....Slightly pricey; really good.In the pedestrian area of the Area Gotic (Barri Gotic)---don't think they take reservations.",
