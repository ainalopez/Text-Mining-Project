    "For our last dinner at Barcelona, I decided to splurge a little and have The Tasting Menu at Hisop for 57 Euro.Hisop serves contemporary Catalan cuisine which I would not have able to experience in Toronto especially at this price point. The main concern though is my Yelp Friend always hungry. The question is would this \"tasting\" menu enough to make him happy? For the night we were served:- Sea Urchin with Vermounth- Bacon, Peas and Truffle- Vilanova Prawn with Artichokes- Pularda Rice with Truffle- Fish of the Day with Mantis Shrimp \"Suquet\"- Pigeon with Truffle Cannelloni and Vanilla- Cheese Selection- Dessert: Viennese Coffee/Grapefruit with Passion Fruit and EucalyptusYes, every single dish above and there was nothing that I need to share. \u00a0No decision needed to be make... I even have a chance to taste all those local cheese. And I definitely glad that I love truffles!Presentation was top notch. Every dish were a different experience of taste and texture. \u00a0A feast for all the senses!Why no a 5 star experience? Service was a little rush and mechanical. But highly recommended \u00a0as a foodie experience when in Barcelona at an affordable price!",
