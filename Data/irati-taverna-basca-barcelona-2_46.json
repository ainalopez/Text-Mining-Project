    "There are a staggeringly decent amount of Basque pintxos bars in Barcelona and I had no idea what they were until I did some investigation and research. Here's what I learned: 'Pintxo' is the 'Basque take on the Spanish word 'pincho', which itself comes from the verb 'pinchar', which is 'to pierce'. Pintxos are traditionally pierced with a toothpick, to attach the cheese, veggie, seafood or meat to the piece of bread that it invariably comes attached to. I kept noticing places with plates upon plates of these little nibbles set atop the bar with toothpicks stuck in them and wanted to start grazing. Upon further investigation I learned that the method of adding the bill at these pintxos places is by the number of toothpicks accumulated on your plate. Love it! I love sampling and the art of appetizers, so this pintxos system was not only intriguing, but a necessary piece of my full Spanish gastronomic experience. We got to the bar and it was a free for all self serve experience. Take what you want, order a drink and stand (no chairs) and eat as many pintxos as you like. Some where basic with just cheese and bread, while others involved meat and seafood. All are about two bites, making it a perfect midday or late night snack stop. There is a sit down Basque style restaurant in the back of the bar. We looked at the menu and it looked interesting.",
