    "This place has great food at a reasonable price. We went there twice during our 5 days stay in Barcelona. It looks like both locals and tourists go there. We tried the pork leg, octopus, potato dish, grilled meat plate and grilled seafood plate, seafood paella, etc. My fav are the octopus, grilled seafood plate and meat plate. The seafood plate was huge with all kinda of seafood! We had the house red wine both visits, it's only 3.5 euro for a bottle but quite delicious! We liked the seafood paella but it's too salty for our taste. I would give it a five star if the paella is less salty; it seems everything is more salty than the food in Chicago. Additionally the service is great. The waitress is very nice to explain the daily specials to us in English.",
