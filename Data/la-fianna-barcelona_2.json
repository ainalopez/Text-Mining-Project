    "Stumbled across this place and lucky we did! The interior looks awesome with a dark cool ambiance. We ordered a pitcher of sangria cava that was quite delicious and worth the price. We also ordered the vegetables with goat cheese, 4 cheese ravioli and chicken curry. Everything was delicious!! Definitely recommend this place. We came here on a Wednesday night so we had no trouble getting a table, not sure about the weekend crowd.",
