    "The lady working here is really nice ^_^ I thought the churros were a tad too sweet, but then I probably shouldn't have ordered the one with Dulce de Leche inside, since churros are already covered in sugar. Good churros, just cross the street & move away from Sagrada Familia & you're here :)",
