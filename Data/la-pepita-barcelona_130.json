    "House red...meh, I'd pass. Young and a little rough.Octopus on potatoes-tender octopus with smooth potatoes topped with a tomatillo-like sauce that tasted a little Mexican to me. It was mild and fresh.Deep fried eggplant balls with goat cheese crema and diced apples. Very interesting but slightly odd at the same time. R had no problem polishing them off.Deep fried calamari, perfectly fried. Thick and yum on a bed of arugula. Do yourself a favor, ask for the sauce on the side. There was waaaaay too much.Wish we'd ordered a pepita, they looked delish.",
