    "A nice, but comfortable setting. We ordered Pizza because I wanted to see how true to Neapolitan they were. As far as pizza goes in the Southern (non-Italian) regions, this is pretty solid. From a critical perspective, I was expecting better flavour out of their dough. They are using Caputo flour, so no excuses. The only thing I can think is that they are not giving the dough enough time to allow the gluten to build up the flavours (12 - 24 hours). While I liked my Pizza, If I did this at home I would have added garlic to the base and shaken an oregano bushel over the top to finish off the flavour a bit more.But yes, I am being truly and overly critical. The end result is that I would come back for a few more tries of Pizza and I would be grateful that I was eating something pretty close to what pizza should be.Next go...
