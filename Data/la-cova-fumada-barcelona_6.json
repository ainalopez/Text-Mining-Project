    "Dios Mio! This chef is a wonderful old Spaniard and she rocks it out of the house! I wish she was my mom --sorry mom. The way she cooks, you just feel the love. There is no pretense and no fanfare here. Actually, come to think of it, there are practically no seats and the paint is pealing of the walls. La Cova Fumada or (trans) the smoky cove closes mid-afternoon and be prepared to wait. Will they serve you in time? Who cares, it's Spain, things slow down midday. A couple of Estrellas, or a cup of vino tinto and you're good to go. Mingle with the locals and learn something, because once you sit down the joy begins. Will the food take you to heaven and back? Yes. Actually, it all depends on your refined palette. This is as local as it gets, down to the local Flamenco singers that pop into the restaurant mid-meal to do their joyous and raucous singing for a few Euros. Order the shrimp, it's a knockout. Practically flown in from the Mediterranean Sea, so fresh it practically jumps into your mouth from its rich garlicky stew. However, do yourself a favor and don't stop there, its all scrumptious. Vale!",
