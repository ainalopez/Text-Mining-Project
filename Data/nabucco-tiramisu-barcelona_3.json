    "Fantastic coffee bar serving great fresh coffee and food all with organic ingredients. We were seaching for the perfect coffee bar that had great breakfast and found it right here in Placa de la Villa de Gracia!! Excellent service and wonderful freshly squeezed juices and great coffee. Cakes, pastries, pizzas and breads for their paninis baked fresh in their kitchen. Check this out!",
