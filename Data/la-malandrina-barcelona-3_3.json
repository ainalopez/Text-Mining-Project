    "Meh.....the only pro to this place is the price for the portion. Servers are pretty rude, especially the older lady with bangs & glasses. I saw her get an attitude with multiple customers including us when I questioned about the baked potato I ordered. I thought it was an actual whole potato but it's basically baked French fries. It's true that in the menu they give different options to cook your steak but servers don't ask how you'll like it cooked so what's the point of showing the choices??We had to hurry & tell them we wanted medium rare steaks, came out suuupeer chewy. Gets annoying to chew after a while. Again you get your money's worth with the portions but overall, I definitely WILL NOT come here again not recommend this place. Nothing here is flavorful, just basic dishes. BTW THIS IS CASH ONLY!!!!!",
