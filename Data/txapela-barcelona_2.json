    "This place was recommended by my wife co-worker in Barcelona. I expected a local gem. But found out later that this is a chain. Food was good as our first meal in Barcelona. But found so many other places better. See my other reviews. Every tapas were served over bread. It was very friendly for Americans. The waiting service team all spoke English and the menu were also in English. I think it a good place for a tourist. Good food and service. Nothing amazing nothing bad.",
