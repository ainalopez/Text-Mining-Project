    "Loved this place - local Catalan cuisine done with a light touch. We came by here twice for long lazy lunches over our three weeks in Barcelona, \u00a0as well as a farewell Barcelona dinner. It has a nice patio where you can sit and people watch. They welcomed our kids, who are culinary adventurers, and they loved it too. The Catalan focaccia with fresh tuna, caramelized onions and tomatoes in confit was excellent as was the acorn fed Iberian pork loin grilled with Padron peppers. \u00a0A great selection of local wines from Priorat and Penedes. We'll be back.",
