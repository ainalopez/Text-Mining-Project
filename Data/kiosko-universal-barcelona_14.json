    "I had the best meal of my entire trip to Barcelona at Kisoko Universal. \u00a0It was incredible! \u00a0I wandered around and ended up choosing it for a late breakfast/early lunch after seeing open stools and, oddly enough, remembering it from a Rick Steves guidebook. \u00a0I was pulled in instantly by the gigantic plate of mushrooms on the counter in front of me. \u00a0I am a mushroom fanatic, so once I saw those, I easily knew that I would be ordering the mixed mushroom plate.The staff is friendly and, despite how busy it can get there, it is easy to get their attention and quickly order. \u00a0I put in my order for the mixed mushrooms and a cappuccino and patiently waited! \u00a0Thankfully, the food came out extremely quickly. \u00a0I took my first bite and, sweet jesus...it was amazing. \u00a0The flavors were incredible. \u00a0I don't know what combination of oils and herbs they used (heck, I don't even know the names of all the mushrooms in the mix!), but whatever it was equaled magic. \u00a0My instant reaction was to start shoveling in bite after bite, but I held restraint and decided to instead savor each bite - a much smarter idea! \u00a0The mushrooms came with a side of bread, which was great as I was able to sop up the extra oil and herbs that were left behind on the plate. \u00a0The cappuccino was the perfect topper to the meal. \u00a0For only about 12\u20ac, I had the meal of my entire trip. \u00a0I left very satisfied and happy.I even returned on another occasion to have the mushrooms again. \u00a0This time I dragged my boyfriend along and we ordered some shrimp as well and split everything. \u00a0The mushrooms weren't quite as mind-blowing (there's nothing like the first time, I guess haha!), but they were amazing nonetheless. \u00a0I heart this place. \u00a0You must go here while in Barcelona!",
