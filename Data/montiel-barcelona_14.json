    "Exceptional food from the very first bite. Staff catered the menu for me, since I don't eat fish. The service was perfect, best I found in Europe. Marcos, the owner, worked just as hard as his staff and conversed with every guest. The dining room is small (no more than 10 tables) which allows for a quiet and intimate environment to enjoy the ambiance and food. HIGHLY recommend this place! EXCELLENT!",
