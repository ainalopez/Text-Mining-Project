    "3.5 stars. \u00a0Cocktails were great (I had the Manhattan and my wife had the Strawberry Rossini). \u00a0Food was good, but wasn't too memorable compared to all the great restaurants in Barcelona (we had the steak and the chicken croquettes). \u00a0Service was very slow. \u00a0It didn't seem like they had enough people working to handle the crowd.Ambiance was really cool and made up for the slow service.This is a great place to grab a cocktail, but I wouldn't go back for the full dinner experience again.",
