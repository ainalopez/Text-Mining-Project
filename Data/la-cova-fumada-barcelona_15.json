    "We went to La Cova Fumada where we are probably the only tourists in here. Line was long, but I'm happy we waited. It's located in a square where you can have a drink while you wait. The bomba is definitely the best tapa on the menu. Chorizo, judias, and pan tostada are worthwhile as well. Cod was a bit too salty for me. The place is very small and discrete since there is no sign, but the giveaway is the line out the door just to get on the wait list. If you're in a rush, you can stand at the bar to eat or take away. All the staff is friendly, but I think it definitely helped that I spoke Spanish and was gracious in my attempts to speak with them. (From previous reviews, I read that English will get you nowhere in here). The server will tell you what's good on the menu and won't try to upsell. Artichokes were out of season -- damnit. I'd go again, but perhaps when I'm not starving and don't mind the wait.",
