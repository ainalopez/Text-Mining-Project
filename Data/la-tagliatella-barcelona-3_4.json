    "This restaurant deserves 5 star. It's interesting that any review less than 5 comes from entitled Americans! The food was the best Italian I have ever had in my life. The service was perfect. The gentleman who was serving us was the only person there and he was on top of it. He was taking care of half of the restaurant with out any drama or attitude. If you crave Italian food while visiting Barcelona, then you won't be disappointed.",
