    "I just want to highlight that these sandwiches are MASSIVE. Seriously, if you really wanted to save even more money / want to be able to walk afterward, you should split these babies.I got the smoked salmon with feta and was not disappointed although a girl in training was putting together my order and she misunderstood what I wanted. There were a billion fresh options of things to put on the sandwich so it didn't make a huge difference. Yes to patatas bravas. That is all.",
