    "we had a long wait, but the food was super excellent. The clams with ham was so delicious, and the tuna tartare was also really really good. There's no menu, really, so we just asked the chef/waiter to give us a few good things and we got five different excellent dishes. The only downside is you don't find out how much anything costs until you got the bill - turns out we spent 70 euros on lunch!! it was kind of worth it though, everything was so delicious and our lunch did include wine and beer. but maybe think twice about this if you're on a budget.",
