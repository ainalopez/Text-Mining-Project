    "With hyper veggie wife we look for options whenever we travel. This place has it all. Good vibe, decor, service, staff, the food was very good, loved our special salads, breads, juices, apple crumb, my wife even bought an extra juice to take with us. Slightly pricier but 100% worth it. Great location too, We will go back when we return to this great city.",
