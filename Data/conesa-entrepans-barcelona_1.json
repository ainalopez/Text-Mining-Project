    "If heaven has gluten free sandwiches, I bet they're Conesa's.Gluten free sandwiches are a rare thing to find, and these were so good I came back each day I was on vacation in Barcelona. I think they started to recognize me by the third time (and slightly judge), but I don't even care because the sandwiches were amazing. Each time, I got the pollastre, with chicken, lettuce, onion, and tomato, and it was the perfect amount of greasy protein-filled warmth. A sticker on the door displays that they've been certified by a local gluten free association, and the sandwiches are made in a completely separate part of their kitchen. I had my doubts when I saw the place, but I didn't get sick once. And best of all? They're so cheap! Sure, there's like a 1\u20ac up charge for gluten free, but the sandwiches still totaled up to be around 5\u20ac. I swear, I've never had gluten free food for that cheap in my life!If I ever go back to Barcelona, you can bet one of the first places I'll go is Conesa's. If you're gluten free and in Barcelona, you can't miss this place.",
