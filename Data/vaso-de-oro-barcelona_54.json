    "I live walking distance from Vaso de Oro and this is often a go-to spot to grab a beer in the Barceloneta neighborhood. It's owned by Fort Brewing, an artesanal brewery here in Barcelona, and their beer that they have on tap is excellent (I highly recommend the Porter!). \u00a0Wide variety of tapas and plates that are equally good. The bar has basically one long counter with bar stools and tables at one end, it gets very busy and loud as others have mentioned as it is a favorite with the locals, but for me the atmosphere is great. The staff is friendly, welcoming, and wear sailing captain's uniforms that gives the place a good atmosphere and is a nice tribute to the neighborhood's roots in the fishing industry. Even at its busiest the staff is very attentive and you don't ever wait too long for a refill or for your food to come out. Highly recommended!",
