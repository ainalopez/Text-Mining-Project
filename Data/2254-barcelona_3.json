    "2254 has excellent food in a casual atmosphere, and is exceptional value. My wife and I had the 65 euro tasting menu and love almost every dish. The 17 euro matching wines were also good, though note that you're getting generous portions of a few wines, not a small taste of 12 different wines to match each course. The theme of the wine is consistent with the food, a mixture of Italian, French and Catalonian.My favourite dishes were the foie gras mousse with truffle butter (not too rich, which is important for me as I don't really like foie gras), chef's tagliatelle (essentially a carbonara) and the 72 hour oxtail.The service was excellent too - our waiter spoke great English and the restaurant was flexible with switching our dishes or wines for others.",
