    "This is a catch all tapas market. The food was delicious, it could be a bit pricey though. Various food vendors in the market-all very friendly. And you can see them making your food. So I had a turkey Cesar salad and some filled octopus on crusted bread and a sangria. The sangria is of note because it's of course hecho a mano. He tailored it to my taste- I told him it was too sweet so he put more wine in it. It was a pretty epic sangria. I really enjoyed the culinary experience. They supposedly have music on Thursday. However, the people seem to be confused about the day. So verify that before you hinge your plans on going. Even still, you'll love the food.",
