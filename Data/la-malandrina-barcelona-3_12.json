    "I really don't understand all the great reviews of this place. Either I came on a bad evening or I am a steak snob. Yes the sirloin steak is only eight euro, but it came very rare when I ordered it medium the first time and then when they refired it it came back still pretty rare. Regardless I could hardly cut the steak with a knife and it had no flavor. I couldn't even eat it.My husband opted for the grilled chicken, and while the chicken was cooked okay, it had zero seasoning.The dipping sauces and bread were the only redeeming qualities and the creamed potatoes gave me at least something to eat. Also note they only take cash no credit cards.",
