    "I'm not sure how I found this place, but we walked by it a few times and thought it looked cool so after a long day we ended back in the area and decided to give it a shot.Staff was very friendly and the menus were available in several languages. We were immediately served drinks and after ordering food it came out minutes later. We got potatoes bravas, four beef tenderloin tapas, a Spanish omelete and a chicken and pasta salad. The chicken and pasta salad was not particularly good but besides that everything was very good. All that food, two beers and a glass a wine cost 39 euro.",
