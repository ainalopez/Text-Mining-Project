    "We had a magical evening here, having bolted from Sicily due to flooding and somehow stumbling upon this fabulous eatery our first night in Barcelona. Squash blossoms, mussels, patatas bravas were all on point. Absolutely perfect! They honestly have the best sangria I've ever had anywhere. A little pricier, but worth every cent. The staff have a blackboard menu in English if you feel like venturing beyond the well known tapas. Don't hesitate to ask them to make you a delicious paella, which is not on the menu. They did for us and it was great. Cozy atmosphere rounds out the experience. I would not hesitate to return. In fact, we did!",
