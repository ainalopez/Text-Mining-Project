    "Amazing burgers and beer selection. Fairly unique for Barcelona, given that it's generally not easy to find a good variety of beers. Lots of great burger options, but what makes this place so special is the quality of meat and the attention to cooking.Overall, it is the best, most consistently high-quality burger in Barcelona.Unfortunately, the downside is that the service is pretty horrible. Twice, I've gone with someone who asked for a recommendation, only to hear the server say \"I just work here, I don't eat here.\" The staff consistently seem overwhelmed with the traffic, and though apologetic, are neither efficient, nor friendly. I still go on a regular basis, because the food makes the experience a net-positive, but I've definitely had times when I've opted for other restaurants because I didn't want the hassle of BierCaB's service.",
