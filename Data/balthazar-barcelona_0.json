    "Great place though I may be biased because we had a large group special with a fixed menu for dinner. Ambience is dark, nice, and intimate. Drinks are good, and food is decently priced. Presentation of the food was excellent as well.Appetizer- salad with crispy goat, mango, and balsamic vinaigrette was very delicious. The fried goat cheese was great. Entree- tuna tataki was also tasteful and delicious with an Asian zing.Dessert- desserts for chocolate fans was AMAZING if you are a chocolate fan. Super rich brownie and super rich chocolate ice cream. Actually ate the entire thing and licked the plate along with the feast of the groupGreat place in a nice area. Highly recommended.",
