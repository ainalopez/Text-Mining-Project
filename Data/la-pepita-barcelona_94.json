    "Wonderful atmosphere and very good food. Based on an earlier recommendation had the sea bass and strawberries. \u00a0It was ok, not bad but not exciting. Other items were excellent. There was a 35 minute wait so they took us to a sister bistros 2 doors down. This place was great. The best Mojito I've ever had. I'd go again if there weren't so many wonderful places to try. Id be a regular if I was a local.",
