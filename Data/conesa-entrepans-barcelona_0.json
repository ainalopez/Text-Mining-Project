    "A hole-in-the-wall joint that serves its purpose perfectly. I was thrilled to find a veg-friendly spot in the city after my friends kept dragging me to all meat all the time places.I got a salad/rice bowl combo thingiemajig -- was super fresh and had the perfect amount of olive oil to keep me full, but not make me feel fat.Not too much seating in here, so maybe get your stuff to go and eat in the square outside.",
