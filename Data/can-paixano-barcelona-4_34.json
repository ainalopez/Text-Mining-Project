    "I hate to say Yelpers steered me wrong but wow, what a mistake to try this place! I don't get the glowing reviews! Is it hard to find? Yep. Weird street and theirs may be the only open door within blocks. Small? I have a closet at home that's only a couple feet smaller. It's so small there's not even room for a single bar stool in there. It's standing room only. Loud? You can't hear yourself think. Crowded? If you can muscle your way through you might be able to shout out to the counter guys what you want. Might. But then what do you do with it? No place to sit, eat, drink... I LOVE dive bars. Love them! I seek them out. But this place? No thanks. \u00a0We went at an off hour - weekday early afternoon and it was CHAOS! Chaos. If you want to go anyway, be prepared to be jostled, bumped into, have drinks spilled on you, leave with ringing in your ears, and just end up miserable. Is it cheap? Oh yeah, it's cheap. 3 euros for a bottle of cava. But I wouldn't go back here if the food and drinks were free. Be warned. Sometimes it's worth it to pay a little extra to take the civilized route.",
