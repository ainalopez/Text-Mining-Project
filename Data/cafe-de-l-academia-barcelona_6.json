    "3.5 stars.Food was good, but portion is tiny and it's so expensive! It's not definitely not something I'd call a \"local flavor\". \u00a0Most diners are tourists, and the food is half Spanish half Italian. \u00a0Ambiance is pretty nice, relaxing and intimate. Service we received wasn't great, but not terrible either. If you are travelling nearby it's a good place to stop by and grab a bite, but its not worth going across the town for.",
