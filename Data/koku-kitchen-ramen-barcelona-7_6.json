    "Let's just say I have pretty high standards for food, and this place definitely surprised me. A random little shop in Barcelona selling ramen? Hm...But then I got their picante ramen, and the first sip of soup I had, I literally said \"Wow\" out loud. Their picante ramen is basically the miso ramen with kimchi and without the seaweed/cabbage I believe (I sat at the counter and watched them make the bowls, so that's how I know). They use some meat broth for the non-vegetarian ramen, and presumably some vegetarian broth for the vegetarian ramen. Their noodles were quite chewy although I would have liked them thicker, and the amount of soup they gave was great. I find often that I need to ask for more soup at ramen places, but I didn't here! The chasu was also quite tasty; meat was really flavorful, and it was quite tender, not to mention that it's the \"correct\" kind of chasu: fatty and porky. The fat had a lot of flavor too (I didn't actually eat the fat, but while I was filtering it out, I could taste it). The egg was also marinated in some soy sauce or some sort of sauce beforehand; it was really flavorful, and it wasn't fully cooked, yay! Delicious egg (well, they give you half an egg). Kimchi was good, could've been spicier. I added chili sauce to my ramen which made it actually picante, and it was great! I definitely recommend this place, and it's cheaper than the places back home where we get great ramen. At \u20ac8.90 a bowl, it surely filled me up. Plus, the people there were quite friendly too. Good meal, good quantity and quality, and it's easily accessible as it's close to the beach and Las Ramblas. Come around opening hours or prepare to wait a while!",
