    "Thumbs up to the best food I've had in Barcelona!! This is my first review on yelp and I've used it religiously for years now. But I had to recommend this place because of how good the food is. I've been traveling for three months in Europe now and I've not always been lucky with finding good food (even with useing yelp)Allium is a \"slow cooking\" restaurant and is in one of the top food books of places to visit in Barcelona. Their menu choice is small but the product is excellent. They use local produce and products and everything is made to order. The flavor in each dish I've had here is great and I don't get sick two hours after I leave.Please give the place a visit, it's worth your time, taste buds and money.If you're a tourist please take note that I've traveled Europe and this is one of the best places I've eaten at so far and I've eaten at a lot of places.Instagram @faithmariCurator @visitsacramento",
