    "Awesome restaurant. I particularly enjoyed the tomato salad as a starter. I didn't care for the sardine because I don't like breaded fried fish in general but it was still tasty and teriyaki sauce added a nice flare to the dish. Dessert of lemon meringue pie was also refreshing and satisfying. But do make a reservation here even for lunch. I was lucky enough to grab the only walk-in table.",
