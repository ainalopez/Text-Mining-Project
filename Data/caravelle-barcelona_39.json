    "I would have given this place 5 stars a year ago. But as many businesses that find success quickly, they have become complacent and finally, for me, have jumped the shark.First, they stopped hiring responsible and professional people who actually smiled at you when they saw you, and looked like they were enjoying serving you. Now it seems they hire any odd hipster who hates the fact that he has to have a job in life. But people have reviewed their waitstaff enough times here.The quality of the plates dropped in proportion with the amount of times one saw the owner (who is also the head chef) in the kitchen.Two months ago, we were served raw chicken and when we sent it back, the waiter said we were the 3rd table that day to receive raw chicken and that he \"didn't know why\".A few more underwhelming meals and 10-minute waits for a coffee later, today we were served a sandwich, in an old reheated panini bread, of a most horrible chorizo. I had thought about changing my order when I saw the couple at the table next to us send it back. I should have. It was uncuttable, unchewable and, quite frankly, inedible. Well, at least I couldn't eat it, despite the fact that I was very very hungry. I would expect to get served a cheap and badly-cooked piece of chorizo at an old menu del dia place as part of an 8 euro meal. But paying 12 euros for it at Caravelle is simply unacceptable. I'm going to finish with the waitstaff again. They didn't even notice the fact that I had only taken one single bite out of the chorizo when they came to take my plate away 10 minutes after I'd stoped eating it. If they don't care, I don't either. It was good while it lasted. I won't be going back.",
