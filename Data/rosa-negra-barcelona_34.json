    "fierce mojito's!! my favourite? tamarind flavoured, muy especial :) also very strong, big glass, good price. no idea what the other drinks are like, i drink this one every time hehe just kiddin', normal mojito is also great. raspberry mojito is nice but too sweet for me, passion fruit mojito is also ok, just not my thing. coffee also good, very strong.food? great! very tasty, good price, good service. i almost bursted with this much and good food ;)tip: for starter, main, dessert/coffee plus drink (!) you pay \u20ac9 during daytime on weekdays. i recommend 'rosa negra' for this day deal as it is bright and spacious. the other branch 'rosa del raval' is better for drinks during the day/early evening or (drinks+) food during evening/night as it is cozier and very lively.in conclusion: go here if you want to have a good time, great quality, happy wallet and interesting ambiance!",
