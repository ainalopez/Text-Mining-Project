    "We arrived at 3:30pm on a Friday and had to wait about 30 minutes to get a table. You can call ahead for reservations or they have an app for your phone so you can get directions and make a reservation so you won't have to wait. The restaurant closes from 4pm until 8pm and is open \u00a0quite late. Paco Meralgo was recommended by a friend who studied in Barcelona and we were so grateful she shared this with us as our experience couldn't have been better. Service was excellent and food was truly amazing. We ordered the onion, olive and tomato salad, tuna salad with tomato and onion, tomato bread (a must), patas bravas, cod fritters, fried artichokes, garlic shrimp and black pepper filet. The black pepper filet was probably the best beef dish I have ever tasted. Do not miss this dish if you dine there. Everything was delicious and I think we insulted the wait staff when we asked for bread to make sure not a drop of deliciousness was left on our plates.",
