    "3,50 mojitos and (frozen) margaritas... that's the main draw. \u00a0while the mojitos weren't the best (the mint was looking tired and old), they were still pretty tasty, and quite cheap. \u00a0Of the margaritas, my friend tried the regular, passionfruit (her favorite), and strawberry (her least favorite). \u00a0if you want a margarita rocks, it's an extra 2 euros. \u00a0the hard shell tacos looked decent (i didn't have any). \u00a0I forgot what my group said about the quesadillas, but the pico de gallo that accompanied the quesadilla was good, and one of the salsas was actually a bit spicy (translation - if you're a spaniard, this would be very hot... to me, it was barely a tingle). \u00a0Apparently this is the sister location to Rosa de Raval, and it gets packed. \u00a0The decor was playful and fun, and the music was lively. \u00a0It's a good choice for a place to hang out with friends and drink for cheap. \u00a0the food was pricy for mexican, but seeing that I have yet to find good mexican for cheap here, i guess this place is decent.",
