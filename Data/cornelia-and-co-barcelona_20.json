    "Well, we went there because a lot of yelp reviews were very positive. The food was not to our expectations at all. The place is spacious and chic. \u00a0We ordered tomato and ricotta cheese, it is way too big portion and not as tasty, we also ordered spinach ravioli which is ok, the cream rice with shrimp was barely ok. I will not recommend this place to my friends. Comparing to the other restaurants we tried in Barcelona, this one has the worst food among all. I am not sure how it got 4 star reviews. I would give it one star, but the place is nice, the service is ok, so I am giving it a two star.",
