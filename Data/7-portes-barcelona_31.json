    "We had the Rich man's paella and the zarzuela (seafood stew). They were both extremely salty to the point where we couldn't eat more than 2 bites of each!!! The absolute worst paella that I've ever had, which I wasn't expecting given all the positive Yelp reviews.We had researched the best paellas in Barcelona, and this restaurant showed up on multiple lists. I can't understand why, unless you don't know what real Spanish food is supposed to taste like!The service was also terrible, very slow and inattentive.The only way you could enjoy this place is if you were completely wasted. Your money is better elsewhere.",
