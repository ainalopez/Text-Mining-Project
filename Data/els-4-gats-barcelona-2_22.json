    "We stopped in after the Picasso museum and were pleasantly surprised our first visit by a pasta dish with egg. Repeated the experience, or tried to. Were seated in the outer portion on the second visit. Poor service. Had 4 people sit and leave next to us for lack of service and they were basically seated in an aisle. Would not go back except for perhaps a cold beer in a ceramic mug and only only if you don't get seated in the outer portion of the establishment.",
