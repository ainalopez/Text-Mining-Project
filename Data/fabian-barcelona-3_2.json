    "This place clams to have won the pizza of the year award in 2007.Now don't get me wrong, that is an achievement to be proud of, but not if you charge 50 EUROS to try it!They have a special pizza list that seems to have gold leaf as a topping as they are all around 40 euros.And then they have the regular pizza menu with far more reasonable prices.The reasonably priced pizzas are pretty decent, but not the most amazing, certainly not for someone who has spent a lot of time in Italy lately.I just wish their speciality pizzas were more realistically priced, so this review could reflect those too! There is no way I am prepared to pay that much for a pizza so it gets marked down just because of that.",
