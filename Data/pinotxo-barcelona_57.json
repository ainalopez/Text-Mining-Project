    "Its busy as hell, but rest assured - they've got your back. They know who's been waiting, and how long, and will seat you in order. Here's what you should do: Go, get a glass of cava and enjoy the sensory overload while you wait, ask the server or the chef what 4-5 things he recommends, and then be so happy as your tastes are teased and your stomach is pleased. If you'd like recommendations on what to eat, I'll try and recall what we had based on some of our pics and my dodgey memory: some kind of fresh cod/lentils/peppers/pine nuts salad sort of thing, a cheesy potato pancake thing, a pumpkin & peas something or other, and a blood sausage and chickpeas thing ....and holy hell they were all SO good- full of flavors and textures and freshness. My tastebuds are crying now at recollecting this experience and knowing I can't just walk over and have it again right meow. \u00a0Anyway, do yourself a favor and go. Mmmm.",
