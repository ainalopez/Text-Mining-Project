    "We came here on a Sunday night in mid February 2014 for a party of 13. \u00a0Ultimately we were in search of an amazing paella which I can say mission accomplished. \u00a0We made same day reservations which was likely ok given it was a Sunday and off-season.We sat upstairs in a side/private area right next to the open kitchen windows overlooking the amazing floor-to-ceiling window views of the water. \u00a0 They gave us very very good service. \u00a0Some at the table complained of 'over attention' but in my book that is ok with me. \u00a0Prompt, attentive, constant refills of our wine and water, plates immediately removed, etc. \u00a0We had to return one item as the person who ordered it didn't like it --- not that it was prepared badly but she didn't realize how fatty and what texture the Pig Trotter would be (she's not into seafood..). \u00a0And they handled it perfectly - took it back without making her feel even more awkward and uncomfortable and quickly replaced with a veggie paella. \u00a0I feel how a restaurant handles a returned dish says a LOT.Since we were here for a dirty 30 birthday trip we wanted to end off with a cake and candles- which they easily accommodated by bringing out an entire Tiramisu cake and secretly lit the candles we brought - and then only charged us for the number of pieces we ordered rather than the whole cake. \u00a0 \u00a0We ordered loads of food (see receipt pic for pricing) and enjoyed it all. \u00a0The Paella was amazing. \u00a0I had black noodles with cuttlefish which I loved. Calamari and croquets were very good but not special (i.e. prepared like anywhere else). \u00a0And considering all the food and alcohol we consumed we were very happy with the final price of around \u00a350 per person.I would definitely return here.",
