    "I came here because of the good Yelp-reviews and it was absolutely worth it. This adorable place is made for the perfect brunch / breakfast. A look in the menu makes your mouth watering. There's something for any taste, whether you are a bacon lover or Vegetarian. I choose to have the Eggs Benedict with ham on a waffle with a delicious walnut-raisin-salad on the side and it was one of the best breakfast I ever had! Besides that the (organic) coffee is really good and the staff is sweet and quick. I can only recommend this place: I would come here and have breakfast every day if I could!!",
