    "Tucked in the corner of a more so normal/local Ramblas, is La Tertulia. \u00a0The service here is pretty good and they have english menus. \u00a0Notice you will likely be one of the few tourists on the outside and all the locals are inside where the prices are cheaper and where you can watch the football match. \u00a0Tapas are pretty tasty too. \u00a0Try the Eggplant fried with goat cheese or the lamb kabob. \u00a0Mmmm.",
