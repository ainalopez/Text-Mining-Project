    "The atmosphere is authentic and quaint with an outdoor patio in a small square to add extra ambiance. \u00a0The food was amazing. \u00a0My wife and I shared a few dishes and we're both surprised that even things a little out of our comfort zone, were fantastic. \u00a0The swarm of waiters were attentive and I was amazed that they all knew our order in such a busy place. \u00a0Try the eggplant, calamari and salmon tartar! \u00a0We enjoyed the wine and coffee at a reasonable price. \u00a0Definitely worth wandering the Born to stumble upon this gem!",
