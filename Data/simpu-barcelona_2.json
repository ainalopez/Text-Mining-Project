    "Far and away the best sushi I have had in ages. I'm coming from Istanbul so my expectations for sushi were already low, but I was blown away by this place. It's been a very long time that I've had shrimp like that. We couldn't stop ordering. Everything on the menu looked great. Would definitely go back if I'm in Barcelona again. Simply heavenly.",
