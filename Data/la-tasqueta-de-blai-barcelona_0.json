    "So glad my first pinxtos experience was here. I have no idea how this hasn't caught on in the rest of the world! They typically have about 20 or so different varieties, most of which are delicious and only 1 euro. The fancy ones are just tad more expensive, but very much worth it. You basically gather as many as you can eat on a plate, consume them, and save the toothpicks so your server knows what to charge you. I went back for seconds because I'm a gluttonous American with no shame. Couple these with a cold Estrella or Sangria and you're in heaven. I'd recommend going on an off hour, since this place gets crazy busy in the evening.",
