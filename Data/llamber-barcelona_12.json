    "Love this restaurants food, drinks and ambiance!! The wait staff was very attentive and checked in on our table frequently which was nice. We tried several tapas all which were fantastic. The pan con tomate and grilled beef they serve is a definite must. We also had a Catalan cheese plate, some sort of beef with a mustard ice cream and the cuddle fish with black rice. All really good!",
