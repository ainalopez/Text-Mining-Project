    "We came to Big Al's because it was an American place in the midst of mediocre Spanish food. As it turns out, we ate mostly Mexican food at Al's and it was some of the best damn Mexican food I've ever had. (And I'm from Socal, so that should tell you something.)The nachos were unbelievable - the meat very tender. (See the pic.) Then we shared the quesadilla which was perfectly grilled and the cheese was of utmost quality.Lastly, we shared a burger. It was a bit on the dry side and left something to be desired, but it might have something to do with the fact that we asked for medium well. (I'd be willing to give the burger dept. another shot.)Oh and the staff was awesome and super friendly. This location is pretty new, so we had some good, personalized attention. If you walk by and don't see anyone there yet, it's likely because no one knows about them. Don't take the current lack of patrons as a bad sign.All in all, I actually wish we had Big Al's in Socal. Apparently Al is from Seattle, so one can only dream he'll trace his steps back to the U.S. and try his cuisine hand there.",
