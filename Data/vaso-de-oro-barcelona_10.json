    "This was worth a tapas stop near the Barceloneta. \u00a0The guy behind the counter deafeningly yells out your order and it is a busy place with mostly a long counter for seating. \u00a0Both the locals and tourists seem to equally know about this place. \u00a0The foie gras was a steal at 9 eu! \u00a0Loved the anchovies, olives, cheese and shishito peppers. \u00a0This place would definitely be in my book to come back to, especially for that foie gras!",
