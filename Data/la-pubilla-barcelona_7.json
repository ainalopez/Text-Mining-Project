    "This place was recommended to me without hesitation by the instructor of a cooking class I took at Espai Boisa. I asked for a recommendation for a place that would be really foodie and gourmet, but not formal or stuffy or cost a billion dollars. I definitely suggest to make a reservation. It was so great! The staff was really nice, and the food was amazing. It felt like we were eating authentic cuisine, but with a super foodie touch. Our bill, after a bottle of wine, two glasses of cava, a fish and a meat entree, and tapas (tomato bread, croquettes, scallop gazpacho, and ravioli), was 88 euros, which was more than fair. Highly recommend to anyone looking for this kind of restaurant in Barcelona. Note: There is also a La Pubilla de Talut. It is a different restaurant. You want La Pubilla in the Gracia area. In case you're wondering: Other restaurants I enjoyed on this trip were Martinez (amazing view, delicious food, relaxed vibe, and friendly staff), Big Fish (chic and hip but not stuffy), Cacao Sampaka (foodie chocolate store/lunch spot owned by Ferran Adria's brother), Escriba pastry store (popped in just for a crema catalana) . Sadly did not make reservations in time for Tickets, or make it for the patatas bravas at Bar Thomas.",
