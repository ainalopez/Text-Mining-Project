    "Loved this restaurant! The tapas were all delicious with the gazpacho with lobster and melon being my favorite. Service was friendly and attentive, prices were really reasonable, and atmosphere was quiet, intimate, and relaxed. It was exactly what we were looking for. Would highly recommend.",
