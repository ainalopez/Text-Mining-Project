    "Extraordinary! Fresh food prepared with imaginative condiments, without being overbearingly \"nouveau.\"Start with some of their homemade vermouth - wow, what planet were we lucky enough to land on! Delicious!Aubergine lightly fried served with salmorejo sauce to accompany, butter-like slices of aged beef, small mussels with a slightly tangy sauce, navajas prepared with just a touch of EVOO, etc.Desert included the freshest cheese-like tart ever, figs pickled in port wine served with ricotta ice cream, etc.The setting is small, welcoming, and decorated simply.Runs around \u20ac70/person, including drinks, desert, and coffee.",
