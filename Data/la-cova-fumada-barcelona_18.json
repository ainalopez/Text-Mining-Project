    "Nice little authentic tapas place in Barceloneta (perfect after a dip in the sea). Usually you share your table with strangers surrounded by tourists and locals. It\u00b4s fun! And a jug of Sangria, sardines, octopus, calamari and bombas (try!) made the evening. Sometimes the waiters come across a bit blunt but at the same time warm-hearted. Although the menu is only in Spanish the staff speaks a little English. Come rather early to find a place (we went 6 pm and found a table immediately).",
