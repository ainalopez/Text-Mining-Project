    "I stayed in Barcelona for 1 month and lived 1 block away from this chicken slinging joint. \u00a0I became a frequent shopper at this Catalonian (?) spot (definitely caters to locals as the menu is in Catalan). \u00a0But the hordes of rotisserie chickens drew me in. \u00a0I bought a half chicken and some rice to go (honestly the only word on the menu besides pollastre (chicken) that I could recognize as it was similar to spanish). \u00a0Price was about 10 euros (reasonable).The chicken is incredible. \u00a0Moist (is that a dirty word nowadays???), juicy, and [insert chicken is amazing adjective]. \u00a0The kicker is the \"juice\" is comes soaked in. \u00a0Amazing glistening sauce that is likely a combo of chicken fat, oil, pear, lemon, and other spices. \u00a0It's got this savory and sweet balance I can't really describe well, other than its the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had. \u00a0Zuni in San Francisco --- you are now 2nd place.This place is packed on Sundays (not sure why, maybe because grocery stores are closed) and I swear the chicken may be a discounted on that day. \u00a0 I'm too scared to engage in convo so I just pay and get the hell outa there with my chicken!!!!",
