    "Very nice experience from the staff to the food and drinks. The restaurant has a nice decor and the staff where friendly and helpfull. The main course we took was t-bone, i love the idea that you can decide yourself how you want your meat just by either eating it like its served or putting it on the hot stone and barbeque it where you are sitting. Great food and I will come back for sure next time i am in Barcelona",
