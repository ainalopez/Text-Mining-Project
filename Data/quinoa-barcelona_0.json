    "It feels strange to give five stars to a glorified grilled cheese sandwich, but so be it! It was filled with eggplant and pesto and the finest tomato slice I've ever refrained from setting to the side. And accompanied by the staggeringly cheap fun juices (apple/avocado/lime, oat/peach/cinnamon) it made exactly the type of dinner we needed after suffering from the dearth of vegetables in the tapas culture.The vegetarian agenda is strong here (the wifi password is practically a PETA slogan) but if you can make vegetarian food taste this good, I'll grant you a pass on agitating.",
