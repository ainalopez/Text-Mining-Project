    "This is a fresh pasta take away restaurant with small sit-in area. Maccarroni was a good find - the pasta is delicious and the emphasis is on simplicity done to perfection. You can add to basic sauces as \u00a0you wish, such as tomato/basil, arrabiata or cheese, with a list of extra ingredients, or just keep it completely simple with a tasty sauce and parmesan. Prices are reasonable, there is one chef on duty and you can see your food being prepared - it can take a little time depending on how busy it is, but it\u00b4s worth it. Of an evening you could find a nice shaded spot in one of the numerous civic spaces in the area and eat al fresco. There isn\u00b4t a big emphasis on Italian food in this area and this is a welcome break from the multitudes of tapas bars all around. For pizza lovers, they put us in touch with Nap pizzerea just around the corner - equally authentic and reasonably priced.",
