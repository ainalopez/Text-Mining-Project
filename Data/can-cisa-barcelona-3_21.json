    "This place may be wonderful but it didn't get the chance to show us. After being seated and waiting for nearly 30 minutes we tried to order wine only to find out half of the list wasn't available. The service was truly slow and terrible and the people next to us appear to have waited longer to get only half of their dinner. The prices seems to be higher than comparable places in the neighborhood. Skip this place as it's not worth the terrible service.",
