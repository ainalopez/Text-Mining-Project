    "The most fun I had in a restaurant this year. Molecular street food in an eclectic street fair setting. \u00a0More tourists than locals. the waiters speak excellent English if that's important to you. The decor is as playful as the cuisine (in a good way)Had the \"olives\" (Which have a very concentrated olive flavor), \u00a0tuna belly cone (great), miniairbags (high scale cheez-its, wouldn't order again), \u00a0oysters and sea lettuce water (very good) and oysters with sherry vinegar and olive oil caviar (even better choice), Gran Reserva iberian ham (mind blowing), tomato tartare (excellent), Razor clams (not a fan of razor clams, but that being said, they did a very good job with them), the mollete (probably the best thing I've eaten this year, got an extra order for dessert), and the mango ice cream (they bring out a mini ice cream cart to serve this, very cute)The Gran Juve Brut Gran Reserva was a great Cava on their wine listWell worth the effort of making reservations and straying away from the main tourist areas of BarcelonaAs an added bonus, we got our picture taken with Ferran and Albert Adria.What fun!",
