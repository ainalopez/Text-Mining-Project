    "Love it! \u00a0Great food, incredibly friendly service considering how busy and crowded the place gets. \u00a0Everyone speaks enough English to get by. \u00a0Had breakfast there several times, the Xuxos are incredible, you can't eat just one! \u00a0The reviewers who couldn't deal with not finding space to sit and finding tapas-style eating expensive just don't get it; this is so much better than the obesity-inducing junk you get in the States, and you really couldn't figure out you just have to hang out and lunge for space as it opens up? \u00a0If we had a place like this where we live I wouldn't eat anywhere elsePS xuxo (pronounced chucho) is this great fried rolled donut, sugared and filled with a creamy custard",
