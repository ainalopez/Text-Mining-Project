    "Stumbled upon this place around the corner from my apartment and it was the best food I'd had in a long time. Probably the best Cuban food I've had in my life. The dishes were authentic, considering the family who runs it are from Cuba. The food was fresh and well prepared. So much flavor! Everything from the Cuban tamal, platanos frito, ropa vieja, malanga, bistec, to the Cuban beer that was oh so tasty! I had a lovely time at this place enjoying every bite on my plate and talking it up with the owners. Very nice couple and outstanding service. Some nights they even have live music! Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Barcelona.",
