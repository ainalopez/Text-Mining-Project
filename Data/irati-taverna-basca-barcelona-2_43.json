    "Come here while walking down Las Ramblas for a typical stand up Tapas experience. \u00a0It's very very small at the counter but that's part of the fun. \u00a0There are definitely better Tapas restaurants in Barcelona however if you're in heavy duty tourist mode walking las Ramblas with a hunger then definitely make a stop.Go in and they'll hand you a plate - take as many tapas from the counter as you like and they'll charge you at the end per toothpick. \u00a0They also walk around hand serving hot tapas that you can try. \u00a0The price is under 2 Euro per toothpick.Great experience. \u00a0I would have given 4 stars but the tapa selection was more limited than what I would have liked --- the bar was filled but probably only 6 types so a lot of repetition. \u00a0There was a restaurant in the back but don't come here for that -- it was empty and the menu was overly priced.",
