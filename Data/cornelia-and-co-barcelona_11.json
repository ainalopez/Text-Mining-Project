    "Ate at Cornelia and Co. on a trip to Barcelona. \u00a0This was the best restaurant we ate at. \u00a0Great menu with attention to the details. \u00a0They also catered to allergies by taking the time to talk to the kitchen about gluten and lactose. \u00a0Staff was very detailed and friendly. \u00a0The food was excellent. \u00a0I suggest the mojitos to start! \u00a0Then try the scallop appetizer. \u00a0Ecological burgers were excellent to. \u00a0Menu is diverse with appetizers and dinners that are not served anywhere else in Barcelona. \u00a0Very unique place.I did not catch the waitresses name, but her brother is also a chef at the restaurant. \u00a0Excellent service and knowledgeable of all the entrees. \u00a0This is a must for a Barcelona visit.",
