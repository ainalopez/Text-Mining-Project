    "I had a great time and great food here! Staff are extra friendly and fast, and food are just insanely good! It's probably little more hip than the classic tapas places i have been, but still I loved the creative and unique dishes as well as great Paella. My friends were having Mojito with black berry and black vodka. They loved it so much they just gulping glass after glass.",
