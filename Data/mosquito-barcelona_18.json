    "As a native San Franciscan, I'd like to think I know more about dim sum than the average Barca tourist - my benchmark being hole-in-the-wall dim sum joints in Chinatown. Then again, I like to think alot of stuff, so just humor me on this one :)Mosquito is an AMAZING find in Barca. The menu is in Catalan and Chinese so even if you're well versed in dumplings, you may need a bit of translation help like I did. The servers were all lovely and on point. I waited 30 minutes to be seated which wasn't bad considering the popularity of this place. On the dumpling menu I had the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), pork dumplings and pork and shrimp siu mai. I also had the grilled aubergine (eggplant) with peanut sauce. It was yummy and the perfect palette cleanser. I even finished off one of their bottles of Sriracha because well...it's pretty much a fact that Sriracha makes everything better. The total came to: 3 dumplings, 1 side of aubergine and 1 beer = 20 euro. Not bad!",
