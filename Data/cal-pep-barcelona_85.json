    "Ok.Are you a foodie bent on getting, or thinking you are getting, the freshest calamari, most flavorful squid and chick pea stew? Maybe this place has the best stuff out there, I dunno, I haven't eaten at a thousand tapas restaurants in Barcelona, but some of these dishes were really, really tasty. Some were just okay. Is maybe getting the best tapas worth waiting for an hour, dealing with a meal paced by the distracted guy with an obnoxious attitude behind the counter, not knowing really what food is coming next, not getting full after eating for an hour, sitting shoulder to shoulder with strangers in an ugly restaurant, getting ignored when you try to pay so other people can sit down, getting a bill for $160 for two people (with no alcohol)... I guess I don't fully regret going, some of the food was excellent, but I will never go back. I guess I would just prefer to walk down the street to any of a handful of restaurants whose average dish is maybe 90% as good, but cost half as much, seat you quickly in beautiful buildings where conversation is easy and they treat you well?... If being a foodie means that you are proud to deal with an 11-item list of inconveniences then you will love cal pep so you can claim to have passed through some sort of tapas ring of fire, you will love cal pep. if you just want a great tapas dinner in barcelona, don't bother.",
