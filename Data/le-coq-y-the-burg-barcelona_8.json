    "Adorable burger and brunch spot near Basilica la Sagrada Familia. Tried to have lunch before our 2:00 p.m. tour of the bascilica got there around 1:00 but with only one couple ordering in front of us could tell we wouldn't have the opportunity to enjoy our lunch and not be rushed or late. \u00a0So we decided to come back another day and so glad we did. \u00a0Agree, not the fastest service but that seems to be typical of Barcelona unless you are doing take away. \u00a0We started with the fries and a salad which they brought out pretty soon after we ordered. \u00a0Both were great! \u00a0The fries were hot, crisp and well seasoned. \u00a0The ketchup on the table had a curry taste. \u00a0Not my cup of tea but my daughter liked it. \u00a0I used the mustard which was spicy and more to my liking. The salad was fresh and veggies were great. Tomatoes looked right off the farm. \u00a0Nicely dressed with a balsamic lemon vinaigrette. For man course I had the fried eggs on a sausage with fresh bread. \u00a0The eggs tasted fresh off the farm. \u00a0The eggs were perfectly cooked the yolk was runny the way I like it. \u00a0My daughter had the burger. \u00a0Which I didn't try but she loved it. \u00a0I did try the herbed mustard which came on the side it was lovely. \u00a0A great experience \u00a0Lovely staff. Great space. \u00a0Would absolutely go back again, \u00a0However, do give yourself time. \u00a0I should add that they were cleaning up after the lunch rush (got there around 2:00) and they had us wait about 10 minutes before they could take our order. \u00a0They did comp our meal because of the wait which was not necessary but much appreciated.",
