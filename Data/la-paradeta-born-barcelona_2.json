    "Good selection of fresh seafood from the local area. We had monk fish, baby sardines (tiny white bodies with black eyes), baby octopus, mini conch, razor clams and monkfish soup. \u00a0A lot of fried (lite compared to US standards) and some saut\u00e9ed. \u00a0Good amount of food for about 25 Euros per person. Well priced when compared to other places we've been. It's a fish market type setup where you select your choices, they weight it, and it's prepared. \u00a0Staff is friendly and speak working English. Opens at 8 and the place was packed by 9 (all tables filled). Good place to whet your seafood appetite for a decent price. As the locals say, this price is \"bajo\" but it is seafood after all so it will never be a Euro.Cheers!",
