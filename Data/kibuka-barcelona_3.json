    "Going to a Japanese place in Barcelona ? \u00a0I had avoided trying to eat at any Asian restaurants in Europe, especially Japanese food! \u00a0But I couldn't hold it anymore when I was in Barcelona so I caved and found this delightful place.The staff are fun to observe, I've gotta admit.Freshness of the sushi itself are just average but the rolls and seweed/cucumber salad are worth ordering.When I was here it wasn't busy, but then again, that was before 9pm.Servers speak English and English menus are available upon request, as I recall.Although if I lived here, this wouldn't be my sushi fix but for other Japanese cuisines, it's worth a try.",
