    "Nice restaurant in a lively area of Barcelona. Trendy but sophisticated atmosphere. Fast and nice staff. The restaurant offers a variety of tapas but also full size 'regular' meals. The tuna tartar with avocado was fresh and tasty! I also recommend the prawn risotto tapas. Prices-value-ratio was good!The only disappointment was the open house wine - which was the only option if you don't want to buy a full bottle but only a glass of wine. The red house wine smelled promising but tasted very bland. Nothing special. The free prosecco welcome aperitif was better than the house wine. You may want to invest in a bottle...",
