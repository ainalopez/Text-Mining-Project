    "Pau Claris offers win-win-win...delicious food, delightful service and intimate decor. The restaurant focuses on farm-to-table and locally sourced food. \u00a0The chef does a wonderful job creating menus based on seasonal freshness. \u00a0He is innovative in his preparation and his plating is artful. Best of all the flavors combine in a way that excites all the senses! \u00a0They are masterful at both meats and fish. We have been several times and had the pleasure of trying pork, lamb (my personal favorite), cod, salmon, shrimp, etc. Most dishes have vegetables (rare in Spain!) so if you are craving healthy and delicious food, come here for sure! \u00a0Also, don't miss the croquettes, especially the tomato-basil-rosemary ones!! It's a small place that welcomes all, local residents, business people, and tourists. It's also open all hours so if you are in search of a late lunch or early dinner, they are open. It is located on the edge of Eixample, near Gracia. One block from Diagonal metro, perfect for dinner then over to Gracia for a drink!",
