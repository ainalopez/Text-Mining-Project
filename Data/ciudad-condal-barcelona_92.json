    "This is one of the top tapas places I've ever been to! Great food, great location, great ambience, good beer! The only trouble is finding a seat at the bar after 6:00 pm specially if you're with more than 2 people.It's got very decent prices and I feel comfortable to say that anything you order from the tapas menu will be outstanding!",
