    "Try it you'll like it! I started off with a strawberry mojito which was perfectly made. Moved on next to the Salmon and goat cheese Foccacia-fresh and delicious. Next I had the ceviche-incredibly well done! The portions are large (for Europe) and so one of these can fill you up but bring friends and try some different things! I was solo so I only got to try the two bc I enjoyed them so much I couldn't finish and had no room left for more...guess I'll have to come back ;)",
