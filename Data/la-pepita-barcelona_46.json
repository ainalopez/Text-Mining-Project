    "The fu*king BEST Spanish food I've ever had!I would eat here every night if I lived here, hell, I would eat here every night even if I don't live in Barcelona, just in Spain.I can't begin to describe how good of the multiple orgasms the food here left my tongue with.The gazpacho was crazy good, best gazpacho ever. \u00a0Flavors were just right, so refreshing yet satisfying. \u00a0Too bad the portion was a bit small but the melon they put in there and cured jambon, ugh, so good!the octopus dish here is now one of my favorite dishes of all time. \u00a0The octopus was cooked so perfectly tender and not too chewy, seasoned just right and served on some steamed mashed potatoes. \u00a0Perfect, just perfect. \u00a0I can eat this everyday.The rest of the dishes were impressive but nothing compared to what the gazpacho and octopus did to me.Hummus with beets were very fresh and well presented.Ham croquette on the other hand was not great. \u00a0It's made with a lot of cheese and mashed potatoes, fried and topped with slices of Spanish ham. \u00a0A good combo but just too heavy on the cheese.I wish I had tried their famous La Pepitas (sandwiches), they looked delicious and from what the waitress said, they ARE delicious. \u00a0If I ever come back to Barcelona, I would come here again to try their La Pepitas.Service is excellent.Prepare to come early, as early as possible. \u00a0It gets crazy crowded after 8pm & 9pm.",
