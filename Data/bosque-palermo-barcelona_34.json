    "Went down with the family. No wait - awesome! We had the mixed Paella - it was excellent! took a while to make it but it was worth it. Wish we didn't have to wait as long for it though. My son also had the veal sirloin and the flavor was wonderful - well seasoned. The servers spoke good English and it made it a lot easier for us. The prices were very reasonable. We would go back for sure.",
