    "Not sure what Rita V. was talking about, I've not seen skewer-style tapas here.She is correct, however, that it's a hidden gem, off the beaten path in the Barri Gotic; I rarely see other tourists here, mostly locals. \u00a0An employee at a local shop recommended it to us when we'd had really hit-or-miss experiences with local tapas. \u00a0Now we make a point to come here at least once (usually more) whenever we're in town.It's a smallish place with about 10 tables. \u00a0It has a wonderful cozy atmosphere, perfect for dates or just a nice meal with a few friends. \u00a0I brought a group of seven there once and we squeezed around their largest table; I'm not sure they could have seated a larger group. \u00a0If you plan to bring more than four people, I suggest calling ahead to reserve a table.The cuisine and wine selection is mostly local, but with a bit of a French influence (Catalonia is, after all, right next to the French border). \u00a0Our server, Gianni, is a delight and is happy to recommend a good wine to complement your meal. \u00a0His recommendations are always fantastic.It's generally served tapas-style, with a menu of small plates, many of which are commonly found at tapas restaurants, others are more unusual, all delicious. \u00a0The patatas bravas are the best I've had in Barcelona. \u00a0The Iberian acorn-fed ham is not to be missed. \u00a0The plate of artesanal cheeses is amazing, usually with two bries made of sheep's milk and goat's milk, a couple other cheeses, and a lovely sweet sun-dried tomato. \u00a0They're raw cheeses, which in my opinion makes them much tastier than any cheese you could purchase in the US, where unpasteurized dairy is outlawed in most states. \u00a0My favorite dish, however, is the sweet peppers stuffed with mushrooms, cooked in an amazingly sweet creamy sauce.I could go on, but I'll simply say that I've never had a dish here that I didn't like. \u00a0Enjoy!",
