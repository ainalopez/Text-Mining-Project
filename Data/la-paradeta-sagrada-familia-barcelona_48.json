    "Just had an amazing dinner here. Seafood is so fresh and for the price we paid totally worth it. We tried several dishes, each as good as the next. Will definitely be going back for some more gambas! Service was good and the food was extremely quick. Fantastic flavours and the tomato mussels I'll definitely be having again. A great little place!",
