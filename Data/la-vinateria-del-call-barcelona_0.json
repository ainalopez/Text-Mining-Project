    "We've been in Barcelona for 5 days and have had tapas for all 5, we used a combo of our friends from Spain, lonely planet, yelp and time out to get recommendations. The stand out favorite was easily this little place. We ordered the a glass each of wine, manchego cheese, chorizo cooked en cidre, stuffed mussels, roasted peppers and the obligatory pan con tomate. The mussels were EXCELLENT! I can't stress this enough. Here's the kicker everything else was also phenomenal, we loved every dish and were actually upset that we found this gem on our last day. We were stuffed but figured we had to order dessert. If the savory was this good the sweet had to be as well. IT WAS! I ordered the caramel tart with nuts and my gf ordered the chestnut pie, both were great. Overall 5 star meal. Just an Fyi Our 2nd fav of the trip was Tapas 24, with the standout dishes being the bikini, the spice rubbed chicken wings (from the chalk board) and easily the best Pan con tomate (pa amb tomaquet) of the entire trip I could eat an entire meal of just the bread and tomatoes.Every other place had 1 or 2 tasty dishes for instance Casa de tapas Canota had amazing baby pig (cochinillo) And bacallo croquetas",
