    "This place used to be much better. Be careful of sitting outside as there's a hidden 15% surcharge that's not reflected in the menu prices. \u00a0Even the servers think that this is bad business practice but evidently the owners don't care. \u00a0Food was OK but not great. Service was adequate. I wouldn't go back.",
