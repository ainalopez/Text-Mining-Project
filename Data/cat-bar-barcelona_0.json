    "Hands down probably one of the better vegan burgers I have tried ever !!! In the states, I feel as if the vegan burger patties just don't match up to the thick, tasty patty you get here. The beet gazpacho soup was to die for (reminded me of my grandparent's cooking) and the patatas bravas were delish! The beer selection was quite great especially since they had a nice strong 9% on the menu! As mentioned before there really isn't much of a selection but you are coming here for a burger - not an 8 course meal!Keep doing your thing Cat Bar - love the funkiness you have going on here :)",
