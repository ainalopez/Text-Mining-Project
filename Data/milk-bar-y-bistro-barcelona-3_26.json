    "A solid brunch spot, but be prepared for a wait if you show up on Sunday morning anytime after 10am.The menu is mostly standard American brunch fare, which is great if you're in the mood for omelettes, pancakes or Benedicts, but it wouldn't be significant if it were anywhere in the states.In particular, they have excellent fried potatoes, and the condiments trays all have Sriracha, which is much needed for all us addicts out there!",
