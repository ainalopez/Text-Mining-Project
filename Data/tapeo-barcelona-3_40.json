    "Visited this nice, small tapas place a few years ago together with a friend. Back then it already was a great place. This made me decide to take my friends and colleagues there while visiting Barcelona for a tradeshow. I'm glad I made a reservation; the place was packed with locals and tourists! We did have to wait for about 25 minutes until they had a table.The chef was still the same, and he recognized me when showing the businesscard of the restaurant he gave me those years ago. With him in the kitchen, food and atmosphere was still excellent. Service was also very friendly and full of humour! A few tips when ordering:- Bombeta Barcelona- Ribs- Cava Sangria- Patatas BravasThese were the highlights for me; but honestly. Anything on the card was simply amazing. Please just go here when in Barcelona. Be prepared to wait a bit for your table, making a reservation is also recommended.",
