    "Best meal I've every had! Ate here while on vacation in Barcelona and we ate at a lot of nice places but this was by far the best. I loved the atmosphere. It wasn't to stuffy or pretentious, very farm to table feeling. We did the gastronomic tasting menu with the wine pairing. It was about 8 courses and 5 wines and almost everything was perfect. The highlight was the tuna belly with lettuce ice cream and apple foam. I'm not usually into the out-there gastronomy restaurants but everything here worked so well. Yes, lettuce ice cream and tuna belly is delicious! The menu constantly changes though so it would be hard to know what to expect before showing up. However, they were very accommodating with altering the set menu. I don't eat beef so they happily swapped out the one beef dish for a fish dish. Most of the dishes were seafood though so it might be hard if you're not into seafood or a vegetarian. I enjoyed doing the wine tasting too. While I didn't love everything they served I got to try a lot of very different wines that I had never heard of before so it was definitely fun to do. For what we got (we were stuffed when we left) I thought it was a great price. The food was 65 euro/pp and the wine tasting was and additional 30 euro/pp.",
