    "We went around 9:30 on Monday and it wasn't too crowded so we avoided the arm-to-arm fight for food ;). I depended on my friend to order and we ended up with two huge (about 9 inch...hahaha) sausage hot dogs which actually had 2 types of Spanish sausages in each, along with cheese and sauteed onions. I thought I'd be full after that but the excitement of being at Can Paixano trumped and we went on to eat a Foie Gras sandwich as well as a sandwich with sausage, peppers, bacon and cheese (when he shouted \"de la casa\" we knew we were in for a treat). All were delicious, although I'd prefer smaller buns for the sandwiches so that the fillings aren't overshadowed. If you're looking for down-to-earth food, this is the place! It's definitely not fancy gourmet food, but if you want to mingle with locals and get full for cheap, Can Paixano's got you covered. Service was friendly and full of smiles. For drinks, just place your glass on the top of the counter and they'll refill it - I tried the Brut and the Rosado. While both were good, the Rosado was the winner! Slightly sweet and refreshing, perfect for washing down heavy food.Can Paixano is a bit hard to find but just look for the street name along a small alley. Have fun!",
