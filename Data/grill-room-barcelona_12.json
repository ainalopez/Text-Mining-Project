    "The day we arrived in Barcelona we were too hungry and ready to be served to cook our own food from the fabulous market so head to one of the restaurants recommended by the owner of the apartment.We were not disapointed. The menu was fairly cheap for our hungry bellies. 15 Euros for three courses and drink.Some strange options on the menu but all was made right in the world when I tasted the squid and vegetable I had opted for as my main. It was so soft I hardly believed it was squid - the tentacles gave it away though and I am forced to acknowledge that evey other chef that has cooked squid for me must immediately go to Barcelona and talk to the Chef at the Grill Room.Be careful what you choose and you are in for a real treat with this place.",
