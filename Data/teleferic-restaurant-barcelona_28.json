    "Thanks, yelp reviewers for helping us find this INCREDIBLE place. \u00a0We ate tapas -- grilled octopus with truffle cream; duck ham with arugula, strawberries and foie gras; eggs , potatoes, truffles and foie gras; foie gras with onion marmalade. \u00a0Plus sangria and red/white wine. \u00a0Terrific service--attentive and chatty, even though crowded. \u00a0Go there this minute.",
