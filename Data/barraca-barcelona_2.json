    "Great restaurant. We didn't have a reservation but the waitress was very kind and accommodated us after 10 minutes wait. Good was really great. No complains and the wine was very good too and not too expensive for the quality. With appetizers, main corse and wine we paid 50\u20ac per person. Again, the quality was excellent.",
