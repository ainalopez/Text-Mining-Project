    "Not a tourist place, but rather a fine local establishment for the residents of Barcelona's wealthiest neighborhood. For us visitors, a welcome relief from a tapas-all-the-time diet. As the name implies, the omelette are exceptional, so this place would be ideal for seekers of an American-style brunch, but the other half of the menu should not be underestimated. My son ordered the L'eggs burger: smallish by American standards but truly gourmet.The restaurant has a dark, chic contemporary feel, and most of the staff speaks some English -- always helpful.",
