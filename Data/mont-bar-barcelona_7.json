    "Excellent modern tapas joint in central Barcelona. seemed very popular with the locals. very accommodating staff, sitting us at 1030pm (early by Spanish standards) was no problem and the service most attentive.very happy to recommend dishes to us. some classics, iberico, tomato bread along with an excellent quinoa salad, anchovies and beautiful steak tartare. the swordfish carpaccio was superb. oh and the burrata...splendid! home-made I believe. lovely setting, lively but not too loud. great wine list. the white we had was superb and very well priced.impressed.",
