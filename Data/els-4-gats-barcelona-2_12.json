    "This place has obviously been re vamped over the years but the mere thought that Picasso visited here (frequently) early in his career is something you can only truly appreciate once you step foot inside.I am sap for things like this. Much like visiting the home of Salvador Dal\u00ed in Cadaqu\u00e9s or Shakespeare & Company in Paris I tend to have a Gil Pender moment (Midnight in Paris) being in the same place that these icons you to spend their time.I wound up having a cappuccino and small dessert which my girlfriend and I shared. Both were enjoyable and I would definitely visit again to relax and get lost in the ambiance .",
