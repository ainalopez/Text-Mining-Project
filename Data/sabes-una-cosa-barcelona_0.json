    "Love this place. Nachos de la casa are the perfect comfort food. Service is fast and friendly. Drinks are cheap. Couldn't ask for a better combo. Most of the staff speak really good English, but let's face it, ordering Mexican food in Spanish is easy and you should get used to it. We've stopped in there twice on our trip and will probably be in there at least one more time before we leave.",
