    "Crowded but service was prompt, friendly - waitress even found some condiments that we were craving back in the kitchen and brought it out for us. \u00a0Padron peppers - excellent. \u00a0Try the fried \"little fishes\" and the squid. \u00a0Lots of tourists but everyone having a good time - we went twice on a relatively short stay so you know it was good!",
