    "Our Barcelona favorite! \u00a0This restaurant has both a Tapas and a full restaurant. \u00a0After 3 a hour lunch of some of the most flavorfull, colorful, beautifully table served dishes, we walked away still discussing what we could have also had... \u00a0As we sat down, we were treated with artfully tapped and pulled hard cider. \u00a0This is one of the Basque specialties.We enjoyed all four of the daily specials... \u00a0Who would have thought that Kidney beans could be exciting...but they were not only very tasty, but the the table side presentation made it fun. \u00a0And we also added some of the standard menu items. \u00a0Every dish was as good as the last, and all were beautifully plated.Make this one of the restaurants you seek out when in Barcelona!",
