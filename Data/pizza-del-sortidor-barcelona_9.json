    "As a looking-for-the-best-pizza pizzaholic as I am, I must say that this place is among the 10 best pizza places I've ever found around the world (including Italy and NYC).Be aware!: they don't have silverware, neither metal nor plastic, so you'll eat your pizza with your hands. And they don't have crystal glasses, so your drink will be served in plastic glasses. But who cares about cutlery or glasses when you have such an amazing pizza in front of you.They are from Venezuela, but the awesome pizzas they serve are Napolitan style or New York pizza style.People who work here are great hosts. Their stereo plays a fantastic pop-rock music, but you have to open your ear, because the volume is kinda low. So what else could you ask for? A fork and a knife?, not for me, thanks, I've got my fingers.Please, don't go to this restaurant, because the place is not roomy, and I wanna find a table next time I stop by there, thanks.",
