    "To wait for it to open, we first stopped by a cafe for a drink and a few tapas, and 10 minutes after it opened, we got there - already a line!The wait wasn't too bad, 20 minutes later, we are in! Standing right in front of the seafood bar, with the fish, the mussels, the oysters, the octopus the sepia, the gamba the prawn, the shells I can't even put a name on! The color and the variety of the fresh seafood was almost overwhelming. We had a LOT. And mind you this was our second dinner, and we ere both light eaters. But toward the end, we both could eat more. The BEST of the BEST was the smoked gamba, big, fresh, juicy, and smoked and salted to perfection, even the legs are crisp and tasty, the heads were pure heaven, you bite in and suck all into your mouth, and the you know you are eating seafood in Barcelona!Why aren't every seafood place like La paradeta? You come in, choose fresh, get it cooked moments later, and you eat. On our way back we passed the harbor and saw ppl eating seafood at white clothes tables with little waiters running around with their salmon or trout, they are easily paying 5x and we don't believe they were eating half as well! If you are in Barcelona, come to la paradeta!",
