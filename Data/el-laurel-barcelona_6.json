    "dare i say, four point five?!I still dream about El Laurel... those empanadas are makin' me drool as we speak. I have eaten almost all of them, the red, the green, the everything.... (well, actually I have yet to eat the sweet one, i've only eaten the savory ones, as i do not have a sweet tooth)GO. trust me. GO. they have a menu in english and catalonian. Thank GOD for the english one. get a beer from the tap (they have jar sized (big cup) or stein sized (BIG ass cup))good service, good food, clean bathrooms. GO GO GO. the ONLY negative thing i can possibly think of, is that it gets a tad loud in there at times.you sincerely won't be sorry for going",
