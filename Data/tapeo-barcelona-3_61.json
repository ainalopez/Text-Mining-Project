    "Outstanding food...every dish we had was excellent...and the best tapas we experienced in Barcelona. \u00a0On the negative side, although staff spoke English, they were exceedingly \"stuffy\" and uptight, and were not very receptive to us as a family of five (despite having a reservation), and the place itself is severely small and crowded, and you feel a bit packed in. \u00a0However, the food is so exceptional, it is probably worth going anyway.Best dishes included: \u00a0honey pork ribs, grilled octopus, burrata and tomato salad, and the lamb skewers. \u00a0Each were outstanding!",
