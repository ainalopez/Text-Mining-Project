    "We came here after catching a concert at the Palau de Musica just down the street. I had Googled the place to make a reservation but Google gave me the address for the one on Pla\u00e7a Sant Josep Oriol, so I ended up making the reservation on the wrong place. No fear as there were a couple of tables open by the time we got there around 10:30 PM.As mentioned in the other review the tables are very close to each other so it was a bit awkward, although at least we only had a table on one side. They had a tasting menu but up to that point we had our fill of the dishes they were offering in the tasting menu so we decided against it, even if at 25 euros including drink and dessert it was a good dealWe got the Padron peppers (delicious although they were a bit too heavy-handed with the sea salt they added at the end), a casserole of razor clams, small white clams, prawns steamed in white wine (delicious and fresh), grilled cuttlefish (amazing), prawns with garlic and sausage with beans. The sausage dish came last and it was very heavy and oily so we decided to get a crema catalana (similar to creme brulee but with a consistency of cream of wheat).Service was efficient although the waiter was kind of quiet (even though we spoke to him in Spanish). Taller de Tapas may not be the hottest ticket in town but for a great meal at good prices in a casual environment I would recommend this place.",
