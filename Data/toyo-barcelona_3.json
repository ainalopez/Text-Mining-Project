    "Amazing sushi! You are served different kinds of sushi and side dished at your table. Very popular and you might have to wait a while to get more food, but the sushi is delicious and the prices are great. When our party had been there for around two hours we were asked if we were finished in a way that was a bit pushy, but that aside, I highly recommend Toyo.",
