    "I made a yelp account just to sing the praises of this restaurant, as I'm considering naming my firstborn son Tucco at the moment. It's easy to miss on the street, but well worth the trip. As soon as we entered we felt welcome. Most of the employees speak English, which helped a lot, and the food was indescribably good. I had the empanadas, of which there are a great variety, each made in front of you with the best tasting ingredients you've ever had. Subtle and simple but better than any food I've ever had. Meals are 8-10 euro, and come with the dish, bread, drinks, and dessert. 8. Euro. Incredible meal for less than some fast food joints. If you're in Spain, anywhere, make the time to go to Tucco. You won't regret it.",
