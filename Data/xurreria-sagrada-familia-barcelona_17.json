    "Don't get me wrong...the churros here deserve five star. \u00a0What my husband and I didn't love was the customer service we received. \u00a0 The guy making churros in the morning was very rude to us, seemingly because we didn't understand the language. We are sorry we don't understand Spanish but we did try to order with our limited Spanish. \u00a0We are sorry it took a while to order but we were being nice and they had no other customer at the shop so what's the rush?? \u00a0On top of that, when other two workers came to the shop later on, they were all looking at us, saying something. \u00a0I'm sure it is because the guy who took our order said something to them. \u00a0Thank you for making us absolutely uncomfortable. \u00a0It's funny how their website is in different languages but we get treated poorly because we don't speak Spanish??? \u00a0I didn't expect the guy to speak English but definitely didn't expect to be treated like a dirt either.",
