    "Just arrived today from L.A. and had pizza and tapas at La Rambla. Wasn't too impress about it and was disappointed at the same time. I thought 13 hour trip for nothing. But it was such a turn table when we went to this joint and hook up with Chef Danny. Help us what to order and gave us the best experience ever. First time tries razor sharp clams and OMG it so delicious. Tried pretty much everything cause it such an experience. Definitely need to try the Manila clams grilled. 13 hour wasn't bad after all... Thank you so much Chef Danny. My wife and I will ever forget you.",
