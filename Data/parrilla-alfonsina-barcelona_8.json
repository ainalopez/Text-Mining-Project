    "Just had an amazing dinner here! Fast, friendly service. \u00a0The food is abundant and delicious. \u00a0Definitely try the traditional ham and cheese Argentinian pastry. \u00a0The salads were very large and very fresh. \u00a0No skimpiness here. \u00a0The steaks are huge, flavorful, and oh, so tender! \u00a0My husband's steak was cooked to perfection, just how he wanted it. \u00a0I like mine very, very well done. \u00a0When it came it was a little too rare for my taste. \u00a0When I asked that they cook it a bit more, the request was graciously accepted and taken care of. \u00a0The steak came back wonderful. \u00a0And the staff checked several times to be sure it was to my liking. \u00a0This was my favorite dinner in Barcelona. \u00a0I highly recommend this restaurant - particularly to Americans who are just a little tired of tapas.",
