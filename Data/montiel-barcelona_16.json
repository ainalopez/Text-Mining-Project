    "We booked this restaurant for our second night in Barcelona. \u00a0This has to be one of my favorite restaurant. \u00a0Similar to \u00a0many of other restaurants, they were small but this one actually had a second floor. \u00a0We had waited all day around the area and were getting tired. \u00a0We didn't want to go back to our hotel only to take the metro all the way back so we lingered in the area. \u00a0We even got seated early too. \u00a0Even though we were a bit tired from the long day, we loved our nearly 3 hours here. \u00a0I tend to eat everything fast but I savored every piece that came my way.First Course: Iberian ham with tomato toastSecond Course: OysterThird Course: Melon soup with extra virgin olive oil ice creamFourth Course: Prawn Tartare with guacamole and lime's airFifth Course: Albacore on thin toasted bread with romesco and capers with edible flowers6th Course: Lobster's Rice7th Course: Ceviche (complementary dish)8th Course: Duck and pears raviolis with foie poele and wild mushroom in Oporto's sauce9th Course: Suckling pork with pumpkin puree (was not on the menu but we were lucky they had it for an upcoming party)10th Course: Alcohol free beer (palate cleanser)11th Course: Peaches, yogurt, and celery ice cream12th Course: Figs, Baileys, Tonka Bean13th Course: Complementary TrufflesWe also got the wine pairing that came with this. \u00a0I highly recommend this as it made every dish seem more enjoyable and it complements it very well. As a result, I now think highly of Spanish wine. \u00a0A great way to experience Spanish wine.Everything was great. \u00a0My favorites were the Prawn Tartare, Ceviche, and Suckling Pork.I would definitely come back! \u00a0Loved it.The service was amazing as well. \u00a0Both the host and waiters were knowledgeable and very nice! \u00a0They were all beautifully prepared.",
