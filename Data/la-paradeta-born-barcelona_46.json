    "The best restaurant we went to in Barcelona on our trip there, and definitely a must-go for seafood lovers!When you go in, you have to order the seafood you want and the quantity at the fresh seafood counter. The lobsters are still alive and the navajas (razor clams) are still squirming!You can't really choose how you want them cooked \u00a0they just do it in their own special style. After some time, they call out your number, and you go pick the dish from the counter. Very self-service, very cafetaria style. But the freshest seafood we had, and amazingly cheap too.There was a queue when we arrived just before opening time at 8pm, and it filled up extremely quickly after that. So I suggest to get there early \u00a0and go with an empty stomach to enjoy all the good seafood.Tip: They only accept cash, so make sure you bring enough.The London Insiderlondon-insider.co.uk",
