    "Authentic, filled up with locals, delicious, affordable, great service...this was my first tapas bar experience and it was a good one. Skip the tourist traps and go out of your way to visit Gasterea. Food-wise (duh), we ate different sausages, manchego, ch\u00e8vre with candied fig, a Spanish \"tortilla\" (omelette), eggplant chips with feta and honey, steak...the list goes on. Oh, and two beers. All for...20 euros. Good enough to visit two nights in a row.",
