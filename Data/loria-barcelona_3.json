    "We were staying close to Loria and decided to stop in on a rainy day. \u00a0The design is very nice, minimal, modern. \u00a0All of the dishes we had were pretty good: cockles, prawns in a lemongrass-cream sauce, bread y tomato w/ olive oil (very fresh), mushroom croquettes. \u00a0Also picked up a bottle of red wine to go (Protos Crianza 2009), recommended by our server, which was very good as well. \u00a0Prices were very reasonable (@30 euro for all the food + 2 ca\u00f1as + a glass of cava + water, not including the bottle of wine to go). \u00a0All in all, a great lunch, would definitely recommend.",
