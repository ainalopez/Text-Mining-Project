    "Was this the best tapas I had in Spain? Absolutely not, nut it was a different experience. I am not going to explain the difference since other reviewers have already done so. I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner if you are picky about the ambience or with a big group. This place is good for lunch or if you are on a budget.",
