    "I was living in Barcelona for 3 months and during that time I've been to La Flauta three times. The staff is extremely friendly and you'll find at least one person who speaks English there and they have English menus. Try to go during the first round of dinner (around 8:30pm - Spanish dinners are late) to get a seat. If you go around 9pm, you'll be waiting anywhere between 1-1.5 hours. Some of my favorites include the cabreados (fries with egg and jamon on top), burger with onion and cheese, and the six layer chocolate cake. It's not the best tapas I've had in Barcelona, but it's a solid place to go to.",
