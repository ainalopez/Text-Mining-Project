    "This place is so Barcelona. And located inside the market in La Rambla.Had a beer and a pincho. What can be better. I had some small bits, bread, olives. And the tomato bread. The tomato bread was incredible. I think it's the best I've ever had. You can see the cooks and everything that is going on. I love that. Ingredients are super fresh!",
