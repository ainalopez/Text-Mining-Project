    "Paella-lover's paradise!The shimmering blue Mediterranean fills the massive windows, but get a table outside for the truly authentic Barcelona vibe... Drinks were refreshing & heavy!Start off with muscles saut\u00e9ed with garlic and parsley, and the abuelas cod-fish croquettes, both are so fresh, you get the feeling the ingredients were in the ocean that morning... Paella is a must here, you'll find it served everywhere, but this place is truly the best!!",
