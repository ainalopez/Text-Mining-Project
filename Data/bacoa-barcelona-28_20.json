    "Great big burgers with a variety of options. All of our groups options were very tasty and satisfying. \u00a0Service is pretty poor but that is the setup. \u00a0We didn't receive out complete order and it took asking 3 times to get it. \u00a0It was very crowded so getting seats together was a challenge but the ambiance is good. \u00a0I would Definitely would go back when I need a break from tapas.",
