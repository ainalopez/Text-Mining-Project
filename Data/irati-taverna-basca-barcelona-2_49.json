    "went tonite for a tapas & wine light dinner- recommended by front desk staff at Hotel Colon. Exceeded our expectations - an Irati in Ridgewood, NJ, USA with a beer and wine license and parkig of course would be foodie heaven. We had 5-6 tapas a piece and some wonderful local wines by the glass. Natives and tourists abound- friendly staff and the variety just kept on coming. We were told that an Irati is in the works for NYC- we cant wait. What a treat !",
