    "This place has the type of food you'd want if you're a homesick American. All the typical favorites like pancakes, waffles and omelettes are here. The music is loud and you'll most likely wait for a table. Nothing special here to make a long trek for. If you're in the neighborhood and want American food for some reason, this should work.",
