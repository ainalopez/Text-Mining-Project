    "My family came here after a very exhausting day full of walking. \u00a0We were super happy to see that the restaurant had plenty of seating available. \u00a0After having already spent several days eating lots and lots of tapas, we were relieved to see the menu had additional options like steaks, sandwiches, and salads. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, we loved the tapas, but after a while we just wanted something different.I killed my entire plate, which was a very generous serving of steak, fries, and roasted tomatoes. \u00a0Everything was very tasty. \u00a0My hubby's pork and bacon sandwich and salad were also excellent. \u00a0The sandwich was actually my favorite and I was sort of sad I didn't get my own.Service was a little bit confusing and inefficient as we had about 4 waiters and slow service. \u00a0Prices were reasonable for what we got. \u00a0Definitely worth a try if you're looking for a hearty and delicious meal.",
