    "Hilariously un-marked restaurant that is full of tasty, freshly-prepared tapas.You may not see a sign, but you will notice the crowd of people jammed into this relatively small restaurant (maybe 8 tables?) surrounded by a small food counter and an open kitchen.We ordered a large variety of tapas including meat, fish, and vegetarian (bean) options. \u00a0All were excellently prepared. \u00a0Very affordable as well. \u00a0My favorites were the sardines, ham, garbanzo, and white-bean dishes.",
