    "I found this restaurant to be an utter disappointment. My partner and I were looking forward to some traditional Catalan food, and went here based on several recommendations. The restaurant is located on a narrow, charming street a couple of blocks off of La Rambla, and we were hopeful that would be enough to insulate it from the touristy cheeziness of many restaurants in the area. What we experienced was a drab tourist trap with unpleasant service, no atmosphere, and food that was an insult to Catalan cuisine. \u00a0We started with a couple of small plates, shrimp (the one thing that was reasonably good), and peas with jamon which were dry and chalky. Then, my partner had the monkfish which was overcooked and distinctly fishy. I had the paella especial; dried out chunks of nondescript meat, overcooked and tasteless chunks of fish and greasy, oversalted rice all with a strong fishy oder and taste. Not even a reasonably decent bottle of wine could entirely eliminate the slightly queasy sense of having taken our stomaches to a place they didn't really want to go.",
