    "The quality of food is definitely good here. I ordered pan con tomate and big oysters as starters. pan con tomate was tasty but oysters were just okay not definitely worth the price(5-6 euros for one piece). Paella was okay too. The main courses here( meat and fish) were really good and should be given for five stars. Only thing I am not happy with is the service here. Maybe I got spoiled by all the fancy restaurant back to United States but it did take me 15mins to wait for waiters came and order food not to mentioned that during this time I even got ignored by one of the waiters here. Anyway, after waiter came everything got better. All in all it is a really good restaurant from a tourist's view.",
