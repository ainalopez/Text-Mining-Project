    "Wow this place is great! The decor is a mix of industrial and rustic. They have menus in Spanish and English (so convenient!), music is all American-hits, and the cashiers all spoke English. So you might be thinking... This place is catered to tourists, must be a tourist-trap, if so you'd be wrong! This place was located in the gothic area and was full of locals. But the important part, the food...it was amazing! I had La Tana, delish. My husband had La Central, delish. No complaints here. The only warning for Americans who are shy to ask about metric units.... 500g of fries is WAAAAY too much for one person.",
