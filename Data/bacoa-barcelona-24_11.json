    "Excellent burgers and sauces. The patties are flavorful but too big. Next time will sure share or plan to go earlier in the day. I had the Manchego burger and hand cut fries. My husband got the one with hash brown. Mustard is very good and obviously house made, so is the ketchup. A must for burger lovers and anyone who care about quality of food.",
