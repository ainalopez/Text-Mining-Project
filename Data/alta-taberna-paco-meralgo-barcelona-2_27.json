    "Our final dinner in Barcelona was an exceptional one. Started with the courgette flowers (zucchini flowers stuffed with mozzarella, lightly coated and deep fried - excellent); bombas (the best spicy potato meatballs yet); cuttlefish 'Obama' croquettes (Obama because it was black inside from the squid ink used - unfortunately racist but delicious); grilled razor clams (simple and exactly how I love them); sea snails (described by the date as impossible to describe, but I would say it was agreeably chewy, meaty, and 'muddy' like a mussel's innards - but much muddier than a mussel); veal fricandeau with mushrooms (delicious 'stew' with thin, tender slices of veal); and the best prawn/shrimp (Palam\u00f3s, I believe) that I have ever eaten (grilled with salt and oil; so expensive as to require weighing before grilling and billing). I'd eat here regularly if I lived in Barcelona.",
