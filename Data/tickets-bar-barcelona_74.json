    "Amazing. \u00a0Our courses:\"The olives by Tickets\" are a classic example of 'nothing as it seems'. \u00a0Each 'olive' has a consistency similar to a raw egg yolk. \u00a0It slides off the spoon and bursts in your mouth on first bite; leaving you with a mouthful of olive oil. \u00a0Clever and inventive, but with a flavor overwhelming. \u00a0Jamie made her famous 'I'm trying to like it, but it's just too weird face.'\"Mini airbags stuffed with Manchego cheese\" Exactly what it seems, damned good. \u00a0Each puff was like an inflated cracker and you can't really go wrong with Manchego. \u00a0Each bite was crunchy, with a little hint of liquid from the pearls on top. \u00a0On the side you see the \"crystal bread with spread tomato.\" \u00a0Jamie was slowly starting to understand what all the hoopla was about.\"Avocado Galician crab cannelloni with sour cream and light romesco sauce\" \u00a0What looked like a Spanish version of the veritable american sushi classic caterpillar roll was anything but. \u00a0I wouldn't think to use sour cream with the crab, but it worked. \u00a0Our meal was rapidly turning into an all-star tasting menu with each course eclipsing the one it followed.\"Mojado of avocado with spicy loin of cod\" \u00a0Prepared table side, this dish consisted of a take on guacamole made with seawater, served under raw cod. \u00a0If this was our 'sashimi' course, then I wanted more, more, more. \u00a0It was barely even spicy, with just a hint of paprika. \u00a0They also served this with a crust of bread to balance the saltiness of the seawater. \u00a0Everything is so well thought out.\"Tepid Gallician style oyster\" \u00a0This was MY personal course. \u00a0First I had one raw. \u00a0Just a classic, large perfect oyster. \u00a0The next was definitely unique as it was neither hot nor cold and bathed in some sort of tasty oil. \u00a0I almost felt lazy ordering oysters with so much haute cuisine on the menu, but I was happy to sample the local mollusks.\"Razor clam with ginger sauce, cayenne pepper and lemon air\" \u00a0I think this was my first experience with true razor clams and it was love at first bite. \u00a0However, there is a certain way this dish is supposed to be eaten, and it was served with directions in Catalan. \u00a0I just nodded and did my best not to drop it in my lap. \u00a0Who cares though? \u00a0It was freaking delicious and b/c Jamie didn't like the texture I got to have 4.5 of them.\"Joselito's Gran Reserva Iberian Ham\" \u00a0This artisanal ham looked too good to pass up. \u00a0C'mon, Gran Reserva?? \u00a0It was a little bit more buttery/creamy than the usual fare and gave us a good reference point for premium Iberico. \u00a0I'm not sure my palate is up to the challenge of differentiating the subtleties as of yet. \u00a0A few more weeks here, and maybe...Stuffed calamari in it's own ink\" was for me, the quintessential Spanish dining experience. \u00a0I remember my high school spanish teacher, Mrs. Rumore, telling exotic stories about eating 'squid in it's own ink' and feeling vaguely curious. \u00a0The dish arrived as 4 mounds covered in a black creamy sauce. \u00a0This was absolutely to-die-for, possibly one of the highlights of the entire evening. \u00a0Jamie even got over the disconcerting hue of the sauce and dipped some bread in. \u00a0I wiped the plate clean.\"Confit potatoes in olive oil with pork rib sauce and Iberian boiled ham\" \u00a0If the squid was my dish, this was Jamie's. \u00a0Melt-in-your mouth goodness. \u00a0Everything on the plate was cooked to perfection and the whole combo was a perfect greasy oily harmony. \u00a0Hello comfort food, so nice to meet you.\"Sapple of rabbit Salmorejo style\" \u00a0I've ordered rabbit before, but never quite enjoyed it so. \u00a0The meat was perfectly tender and it was food that I could eat with my hands. \u00a0There were actually two on the plate, and we both picked the bones clean. \u00a0I don't like carrots, so swing and a miss there, but add points for style.\"Chocolate and hazelnuts cake tribute to Antoni Escriba\" was a delicious and beautifully conceived, albeit somewhat predictable take on a chocolate mouse cake over a hazel nut crust. \u00a0To prevent us from demolishing it too quickly, I requested a butter knife to split the portions in two.\"Cold-hot chocolate fritters\" followed and replaced the high bar set and met throughout the evening. \u00a0Each bite was gently fried on the outside, warm and gooey inside and cold in the middle. \u00a0The interplay of flavor, temperature and texture made this the star of our three sweet courses. \u00a0Jamie wanted to order another serving. \u00a0I should've agreed.\"Catalan cream roll\" was our swan song. \u00a0A crunchy sugar crust filled with cream. \u00a0It almost looked like something Gaudi might have designed had he been a pastry chef.Count it off: thirteen courses. \u00a0Holy shit that was good. \u00a0And Jamie loved it, too. \u00a0The bill wasn't that bad either, considering the experience. \u00a0I purchased Alan a souvenir copy of the menu and had it personally inscribed by chef Adria.",
