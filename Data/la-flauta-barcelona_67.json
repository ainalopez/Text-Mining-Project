    "locals place for tapas --45-60 min wait at 10:30 pm-- Ordered \"famous\" tapa dish of fried potatoes with garlic and fried eggs on top- VERY greasy. Fava beans with ham. Greasy. Asparagus and mushrooms. Greasy. Mini hamburger. Greasy. Shrimp and calamari bland. Wine delicious. Makes the varsity in atlanta seem like health food- \u00a0I think barcelona hospital nearby for heart cath after dinner. Overpriced, except for wine. -- \u00a0 give your heart a break !! \u00a0 stay away from here",
