    "Amazing Italian food in Barcelona! My family and I were super hungry after a long day of walking around - I found this establishment and we showed up around 7pm. Pro-tip: Unfortunately the hours are listed incorrectly on Yelp, because the restaurant doesn't open for dinner until 8pm. Fortunately, L'Eixample is a beautiful area to walk around especially on a longer summer night. We came back and had one of our favorite meals on this 3+ week trip. Between the 3 of us, we devoured two pizzas and a risotto. At the beginning of the meal, we couldn't stop talking, gushing really, about how 2 people could cater to a full restaurant during dinner service. By the end, we could tell that things were getting a little difficult since we waited a long time for the check. It didn't really matter very much since this was vacation for us, but in another time and in another place, I would probably have been annoyed. Barcelona for 5 days definitely wasn't long enough since we would've come back here again! There were so many things on the menu that I would've loved to try.",
