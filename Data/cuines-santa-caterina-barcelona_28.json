    "Loved this place! Got there right at opening and line was already forming for dinner. I wish I had 3 meals to try all the tapas here. Very reasonably priced for quality of good. Shrimp/gambas and garlic dish was amazing. Rosetta and ravioli dishes were excellent also. Would love to go back again!",
