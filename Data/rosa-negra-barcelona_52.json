    "Went here for the first time on Sunday and had to return the next day. Tried the burrito with grilled chicken as well as the nachos.. Absolutely amazing. The second day I had grilled chicken tacos. Both the passion fruit margarita and raspberry mojito were awesome. I've been missing good Mexican food because I've been abroad for a month now, and I'm pretty tired of these side street restaurants with the same tapas/paella/bocadilla menu. I love this place so much I may need to return again today for lunch. Definitely recommend Rosa Negra.",
