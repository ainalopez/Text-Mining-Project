    "Found this place for lunch while walking the narrow streets of Barceloneta just behind the main thoroughfare. Had a very nice lunch with a couple of beers to wash down a very tasty burger with foie. Seafood tapas were pretty good and my kids liked their pasta selection. Staff were very attentive and friendly.",
