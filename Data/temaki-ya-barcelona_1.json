    "Cute and trendy sushi joint that I ain't mad at. \u00a0I would usually balk at a fast food sushi joint. \u00a0I can be such a sushi snob. \u00a0But you know what you're getting when you walk into this place, so your expectations aren't high. \u00a0It's really yummy, and I enjoy the hot rolls. \u00a0It's probably all types of unhealthy for me, but I dig in. \u00a0And it's surprisingly filling.",
