    "After receiving a suggestion by one of my cousins' son to come to Can Paixano, I read some reviews. After reading the reviews, my hotel was located only 650 meters away (8 minutes walk), I decided to come for Breakfast.Came on a Tuesday morning at 9am, there were only 2 patrons eating. Judging by their talking, the patrons were locals.I saw fresh anchovies and ordered a plate - 5 pieces. Delicious and not overly salty. Had a Botifarra sandwich (sausage) with a bread that looked big, but soft and fresh. Another gem! Still hungry, ordered a Salmon (nova) with fromage (blue cheese) on a sandwich. Again, soft bread and not heavy filling. 3 for 3 on all selections!Also, this is a place to drink \"Cava\". Cava is sort of a bubbly wine that is \"dirt\" cheap, yet did not taste cheap. I ordered the Cava Brut (white wine dry tasting). It went very well with all the foods that was ordered.Ordered to small bottle of water. Time for the check...the total bill came to 11.25 euro (approximately $12.50 USD). This place is a local gem!!",
