    "I have seen this little gem on various shows for years and was on our to do list on most recent trip to Spain. The Mercat De La Boqueria where is it located is a must see if in Barcelona. We have been to markets all over Europe but this one definitely unique even if very crowded.Very crowded with mostly bar seating. I advise waiting but we were there in off season and still took about 20 minutes and a free for all. The service was great and although hectic, they made the time for suggestions. The food was very good but I agree with a few others here that not the best we had in Spain. Definitely worth visiting but be ready for the crowds and tourist pricing.",
