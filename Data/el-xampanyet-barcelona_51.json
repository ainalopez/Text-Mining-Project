    "Super cute little place that looks like it's been around forever! \u00a0They have old looking beer taps and an old style refrigerator.The food was light quick tapas which were all delicious! \u00a0We had the sardines, olives but our two favorites were this little flatbread type thing with chopped anchovies and olives as well as a potato dish with a large circular slice of potato with cheese and something else on it. \u00a0I didn't expect the potato to be so soft but it melts in your mouth. \u00a0They also had bacon wrapped around a breadstick which I sadly never got around to trying...looked delicious though!We went around noon and it wasn't too crowded but when we passed by around 2pm after the Picasso museum, it was standing room only...",
