    "A very fine and hip tapas bar/cafe in L'Eixample. \u00a0This restaurant was a very quick walk from our boutique hotel on Calvet. \u00a0The colorful Eames chairs with Eiffel Tower bases, chic and modern interior, and people-watching alfresco cafe, all on a fashionable corner was a no-brainer for us. \u00a0As it turned out, the food, too, was fresh and flavorful. \u00a0(Grilled octopus was outstanding!) \u00a0Waiter on the first visit was super friendly and attentive. \u00a0(Return visit: \u00a0Well, waitress was slow and not particularly attentive.) \u00a0I'd give the food 4-stars. \u00a0Service, 3-stars. \u00a0Split the difference for a 3-1/2 star overall rating.",
