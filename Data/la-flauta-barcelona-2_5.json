    "Solid spot. Other than the 2 wait staff arguing at one another before getting seated, the food was delicious. I would suggest the anchovies, jamon and grilled calamari. We came here late so some of the staff were finishing up their shift and eating in a round table in the back. I actually appreciated that. Very encouraging to know they also eat the same things we were eating.",
