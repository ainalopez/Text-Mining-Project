    "On a visit to Barcelona, I HAD to tryout one of the best restaurants in the city. As you walk in, you notice the theme to the restaurant is very prevalent. Come to a show and enjoy!RESERVATIONS: They have an online reservation system which you can begin making reservation 1 month in advanced. For Americans this is an easy process as our time zone allows us to book it before the Europeans. I highly recommend you book 1 month before. We were seated next to the bar and as we were waiting for our food Marc Gasol walks into the restaurant. If an NBA player eats here you know you're in for a treat.When the menu came to us it doesn't really mention the Chef's tasting menu. As an american, if you are traveling all the way to Barcelona...get the dang Chef's tasting menu. We had to ask about it and told them we have no food allergies. There's no point in telling you about the food but it was 20 courses along with an extra 2 desserts we got. All in all it was a 2 1/2 hour dinner and it was amazing, inventive, and delicious.",
