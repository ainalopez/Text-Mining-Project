    "We showed up on a weeknight at around 7pm, and it was packed! This place is really small and narrow to begin with, but with everyone in there, it was hard to find a spot. Expect to stand. The guys behind the counter were very friendly, and they helped us get our food despite the row of people between us and the counter. The beer was fine, nothing to write home about, but the tapas...ohhh! I definitely had a mouthgasm.The first few things that we ordered were very tasty -- the spicy tuna, the padron peppers, and the manchego cheese. The last thing that we got was a surprise -- we had tried to order one of their dishes, but they were all out, and so the guy behind the counter recommended their prawns. We were disappointed at first, since it seemed like the prawns would be plain, but I am so VERY glad that he recommended them. The prawns ended up being my favorite dish during our entire stay in Barcelona. They were fresh, cooked with the shell fully on, just on a griddle (I think), but they were cooked to *utter perfection*. The shells slid off easily, and the meat was so tender and juicy. Just think of the most tender and juicy piece of lobster or shrimp that you've ever had and know that it was nothing compared to this set of heavenly morsels. I didn't want to eat anything else for the rest of the evening, just to keep the taste of it fresh on my palate. I'm salivating at the memory... By all means, check this place out.",
