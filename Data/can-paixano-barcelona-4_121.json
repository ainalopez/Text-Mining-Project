    "Simple, cheap, amazing, delicious. Awesome atmosphere... good place to eat/chill/drink.Their offerings are centered around cava (sparkling wine) and sausages (+meat, cheese) in various combinations... e.g. tapas or sandwhiches with said meats/cheese/sausages. The menu is a bit confusing, but just try a bit of everything. It's often super crowded in here, you just need to make eye contact with the people behind the counter and they'll help you... don't be intimidated by the crowd and just order something! You'll usually stick to the same bartender and they'll help you throughout your stay, keeping track of your tab and all. I happened to book a hostel next to this place, and ended up eating/drinking here 5 times in 4 days. Each time was as great as the last, and I was sad I couldn't have it one last time on my last day in Barcelona.p.s. they keep track of your drink/food ratio so you don't get superwasted, so even if you're in a drinky mood you'll have to order some food (which is not a prob since their food and wines go hand in hand)",
