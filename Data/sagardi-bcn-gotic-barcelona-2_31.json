    "Sagardi was a wonderful place to have dinner in the Barri Gotic. We ate in the dining room in the back, behind the Tapas bar. Its a more formal setting and we had really superb service. They are known for their beefsteaks (txuletas de buey) so of course thats what I wanted to try! I was not disappointed. The servings were giant, cooked perfectly rare to my liking, and you can see them cooking the meat over coals in their open kitchen. We all enjoyed the goat cheese salad for starters as well. Overall the dinner was pricy, but worth checking out. They do take reservations, which I would recommend, as they were very busy the night we went.",
