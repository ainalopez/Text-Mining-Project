    "For the price and hype, I was very underwhelmed. We got the tasting menu with 8 course I think. The dinner started off well, some of the started were very good, like the soup (I think it was pumpkin) and the maple shot amuse. Of course the foie gras was to die for. I have a special place in my heart for foie gras and this did not disappoint. \u00a0After that the meal kind of went downhill for me. The fish seemed overcooked to me, the chicken dish lacked flavor and dessert was average. I had such high hopes for Cinc but personally would not recommend.",
