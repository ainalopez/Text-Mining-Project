    "Large menu and good food, but being a big, busy restaurant with long time waiters the service is rushed. \u00a0I was done with a three course food dinner in 30min, and it was because I ask food one \u00a0course at a time. Had I ask all initially, as they waiter expected, It would have been like eating in a fast food but at a healthy price, 70 euros plus drink. \u00a0I think it is over rated.",
