    "All vegan restaurant in the barrio gotic. Great for lunch or take out dinner. There are only a handful of chairs inside. Interesting assortment of quinoa, lentil, soy protein and rice burger patties. Either on their own for 1.85 EUR, with salad or on a bun. Super cheap. Side salad is small but loaded with goodies like avocado, olives, corn, sundried tomatoes and olives. Very tasty and filling. Be sure to grab some vegan cheese for your morning baguette while you are here. The potato tortilla is also a winner. They have an assortment of delectable looking vegan cakes as well but I had to resist after my morning splurges at La Boqueria food market.",
