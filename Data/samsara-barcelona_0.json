    "Excellent tapas place with attentive service. Their focus is somewhat all over the world, mostly arab and asian. The atmosphere is pretty bohemian as many other places in Gracia. We went there with 6 and enjoyed a full dinner with wine for less than 20 Euro/person. Ah, reminds me, the do not have coffee there, but there are many other places around if you can't make it through the night without. Beware of the seats though. They only have banks without back rests. So if you have problems, this might not be the place to go.",
