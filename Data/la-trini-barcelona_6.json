    "This place has a wonderful vibe. It feels pretty local but that's gonna be the feeling anywhere in the gracia barrio. It has something for everyone. If you're in the mood for tapas and drinks this is your place. If you want something a little more filling, they've got you covered there too! Great wine selection and the patatas bravas is a must! They serve the bravas up three different was and all of them are delicious. Also the burger (I think it's the burger \"con todo\" but I'm not entirely sure) is bomb! It has an egg peaking through the bun!Bottom line if you are looking for a cool place to eat in gracia come here. It's also very close to the Verdi movie theatre if you want to grab a bite before the movie. Game day? They'll have the bar\u00e7a game on too if you are looking for a less rowdy crowd than a pub.",
