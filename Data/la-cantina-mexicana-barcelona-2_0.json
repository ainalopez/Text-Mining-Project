    "I must make the case for not only the best Mexican restaurant in Barcelona, but possibly in Europe. I've been going for almost 18 years and it is consistently the best in Barcelona. I cannot recommend this place more heartily. It must not on any account be confused with any other restaurant with the word Cantina in it. Owned by the charming, dedicated Jose and Hector, this is a triumph of a place, with genuine, joyful passion for Mexican food. And the margaritas are stunning. Occasionally there is live music, but it's never tacky. Would you believe that four grown men had, for just EUR120, the following: 12 tortillas ceviche frijoles machaca rajas two enchiladas chile con carne one tres leches to share two beers, nine margaritas Where can you get more pleasure and better value??!",
