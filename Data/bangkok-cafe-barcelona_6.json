    "There's plenty of reviews in Spanish so I figured I'd write this in English.This place is probably the nicest Thai restaurant I've tried in Barcelona (I haven't tried them all though!). The main courses were delicious, very fresh and flavourful. I did enjoy it enough to return a few days later with another friend for lunch.I was actually going to give them 5 stars but I think the quality of the starters lets the place down. I usually love Asian starters (generalizing a bit I know) but of the 5 starters I tried only 2 were especially nice. The other 3 were okay. The service was fine, nice enough. \u00a0Wine price was good. The mains, however, are worth the trip alone.",
