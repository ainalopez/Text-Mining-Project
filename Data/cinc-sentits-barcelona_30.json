    "Gerry & I visited this restaurant in February 2007, and we were amazed and delighted at the food, the wine and the service here. We went for the Tasting Menu - in total, some 10 courses, each one with a different wine. The sommelier (I can't remember her name, but if I remember she was Canadian and part-owner along with the chef) had done a wonderful job of selecting wines. With one beef dish, she brought a red so deep and powerful that it seeemed almost undrinkable on its own - until we tried it with the food, when it came absolutely into its own. One of the highlights was the chocolate dessert - tremendous on its own, but supplemented by a glass of 'vinho de Naranja' (orange dessert wine) it was an absolute taste sensation. Overall, I think the meal was about EUR240 for the two of us, including the wine, coffee and service. While this may seem like a hefty bill, the quality of everything made it well worthwhile. If you're visiting Barcelona and looking for fine dining, look no further!",
