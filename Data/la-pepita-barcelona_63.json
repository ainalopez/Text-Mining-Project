    "So this was my favorite restaurant hands down that we went to in Barcelona. It was recommend to us by multiple friends so I knew we had to go! To explain how friendly and accommodating the staff is, we arrived here upon the brief break time between lunch and dinner but they graciously let us sit for lunch. We started with the sea bass tapa and then each got our own entree. The sea bass was UNREAL - please get this dish if you go and like sea bass. I almost asked for a second one. For my entree I got the burger and asked for a fried egg on top. It was delicious - I basically licked my plate clean and the egg really tied the succulent meat and sides together. If you are in barce and looking for amazing and reasonably priced food you should definitely try this place!",
