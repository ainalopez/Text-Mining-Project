    "Love the atmosphere and decor of this place. My boyfriend and I shared the fried brie-spinach-quince salad and moka cheesecake, and each had the black rice and salmon tofu. The salad was so amazing (in fact, the first thing I did upon returning home was trying to recreate it). Black rice was very tasty. Salmon tofu is definitely different and fun (beet-marinated tofu!), but I noticed the seasoning was a bit off with some uncooked salts sprinkled throughout. The cheesecake was life. Overall it was a fantastic meal, great portion, and reasonably priced. The diverse menu will definitely bring me back the next time I visit Barcelona.",
