    "Such an amazing find. My wife and I toil over yelp reviews, looking for the best and closest food. We chose this chicken place and it was AMAZING. The herbs and seasoning were to die for. We were so excited about this decision. Oh, and then we walked past this little sushi joint around the corner, and went there the next day. I recommend both.",
