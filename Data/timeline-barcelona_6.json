    "Before traveling to a place you've never been to you develop images in your head of what your experiences will be like. You hope to avoid gaudiness and tourist kitsch and rarely does the image in your head actually come to be. In a town bleeding to the edges with every facet of tourist to a point where it threatens the native's way of life a place like Timeline is a treasure. Its homey, casual vibe paired with incredibly simple yet perfectly executed tapas embodies what it is to have a drink and a snack in this town.Going to a cafe in Gracia is a mellow experience. Have a glass, have a chat with someone and throw in an anchovy or three. Out of my entire week in the country their croquets were the clear winner with a perfectly crisp shell on the outside and a gooey center of ham and cheese. Even after going to a couple of upscale cafes in other parts of the country this little dish stood out the most.Do remember than no trip to this city is complete without some boquerones en vinagre which should be your other pick here. Oh you don't like anchovies? Well I don't like going to the dentist but it's good for your health so do it anyway. You may end up falling in love.Hats off to the bartender for making me one hell of a michelada too. My Mexican brethren salute you sir.",
