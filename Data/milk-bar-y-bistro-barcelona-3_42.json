    "On our trip to Barcelona, this was our favorite restaurant. We loved the food, atmosphere, and service so much we had it for brunch multiple times and came back in the evening for cocktails. The Owner was very nice and engaging with the customers. Customer service great and the food was top notch. Go here for a great time.",
