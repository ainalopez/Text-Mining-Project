    "I came here with a friend in September when we were on vacation in Barcelona. \u00a0We decided to try the prix fixe tapas menu (you get to taste ~7 tapas, plus dessert, plus sangria as well as a welcome glass of cava for only 19 euros). \u00a0The cava sangria was absolutely delicious, light, and refreshing; however, if you want something a little stronger, then you should order something else, as my friend and I were barely buzzed after consuming a pitcher each. \u00a0The tapas came out very hurriedly; at some times, we had three different plates on our table. \u00a0The first three tapas included bread with tomato, a homemade salad, and peppers with small ham cubes. \u00a0The bread with tomato was a little bland and the salad was not particularly special, but the peppers were nicely seasoned and fresh-tasting. \u00a0After that, we were given a platter of cured meats, which was great as is expected of Spanish meat plates. \u00a0The next tapa was a blood sausage and chorizo combo. \u00a0The chorizo was very spicy (in a great way) and paired well with the blood sausage/rice. \u00a0Afterwards, they brought out an egg and potato casserole that was hearty and filling, with a duck foie flavoring that provided a deep richness to the plate. \u00a0The prawns were well-cooked and seasoned. \u00a0The dessert, the Catalan cream, was disappointing; it was overly sweet, and didn't have the right balance of temperatures/flavors that I expected.I would probably give the food a 3 overall; however, the fact that we got all that food, dessert, and cava sangria (which left us completely stuffed) for only 19 euros brings this to a 4. \u00a0It is a very reasonably priced restaurant, and the prix fixe tapas menu gives you a wide variety of interesting tapas to try.",
