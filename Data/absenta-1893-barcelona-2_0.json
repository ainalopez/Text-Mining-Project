    "Come here for a legit Barcelona drinking experience. This was my 3rd visit to the great city and I had never been here before.My experience here was kind of surreal, having sworn to never drink absinthe following university, i eventually gave in and had a shot here. Yuck as usual.This is a very local place, not really any tourists here even though it is only a 5 minute walk from Las Ramblas.",
