    "This place is a really great and original bubble tea caf\u00e9.Right in the center of the city, it's easy to get to from the Catalunya metro stop. It's right on one of the beautiful streets leading off of Les Rambles.It's also beautifully decorated. There's this really great green benchy thing in the back of the store decorated as if it was made out of grass (granted it's a little scratchy on bare skin.The staff was really nice, and helpful which is always good!Most importantly the tea was great along with the tapioca that I had with it. I got my usual, but my friend got the pi\u00f1a colada flavor and despite my protestations, convinced me to try it. Let me just say, it was great, and that's for someone who doesn't love pi\u00f1a coladas.I am completely satisfied.",
