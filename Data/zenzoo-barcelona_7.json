    "Lovely experience. The staff is super friendly. The place itself is not for spending time there.maximum 20min, take a break from a hectic day or resting your legs, have a refreshing and tasty tee while doing that.and the variety is huge. The garden style couches makes the place cosy and are also Comfortable for a nice break",
