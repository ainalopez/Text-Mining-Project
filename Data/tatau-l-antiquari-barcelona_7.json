    "In a word: amazing. As our waitress explained, the menu changes daily so they can serve incredibly fresh food. My wife and I had the best mussels we've ever had here, along with great fish and a chicken, mushroom, and rice dish similar to paella. To top it all off, their menu is very affordable. We came in with \u20ac26 in our pockets, and left with the best meal we had during our honeymoon. Great atmosphere, great staff, great food.",
