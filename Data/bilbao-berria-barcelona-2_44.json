    "Toothpick tapas is a pretty cool idea...you pick out what looks good and pay by the piece using toothpicks to keep track. They offered a good variety of tapas/pintxos but the food quality is not that great. The price is reasonable, they have wine & beer, and its fast which makes it good quick bite stop while roaming the area. Its definitely a touristy place. If you want great tapas check out Cervecer\u00eda Catalana or Ca L'Esteve - El Xampanyet.",
