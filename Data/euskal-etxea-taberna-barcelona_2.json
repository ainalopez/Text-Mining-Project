    "Quick review:I had an early lunch, late lunch and dinner during my time in BCN. Amazing place for a quick bite if you're trying to make your way through the city. \u00a0The quality of their ingredients will want you to try as many pinchos as possible. Favorite item: ham croquettes. Best I had in the city. \u00a0Side note: just grab a plate and select the pinchos you want and they'll tally them up at the end.",
