    "This place was absolutely outstanding. We were having trouble finding somewhere to eat, bouncing between tourist trap and overpriced but bland restaurants-- then we found Taverna de Born and WOW! Best tapas we've had in Bar\u00e7a!Everything was delicious. The seared tuna was so incredible I almost ordered a second helping. Even the pan i tomate was better than any other I had eaten. I enjoyed the anchovies and I don't even like anchovies.Easy choice, come eat here! Great sangria too!",
