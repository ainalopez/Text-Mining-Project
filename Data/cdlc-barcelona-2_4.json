    "I came here for my birthday and was sadly disappointed. I don't like to post negative reviews but as the prior reviewer noted I would not revisit this place.GOOD- decor, very classy and elegant with gorgeous ocean view- drinks, Man-goe drink was amazing BAD- rushed to order and complete dinner: waitress was constantly checking and hovering around our table - not typical great Spanish style I have experienced so far in Barcelona. \u00a0They are quick to have you in/out and it made us feel pressured.- Some of the other ladies, hostesses or waitresses, (couldn't tell) were very snobby. \u00a0The men I spoke to were friendly.",
