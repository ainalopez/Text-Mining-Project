    "I loved everything I ate here. It's a quiet little restaurant off the beaten path. We ordered the foie gras stuffed figs, a goat cheese/apple/foie gras dish, prawns in garlic oil, and seafood paella.The figs were absolutely amazing. They sprinkle a thick and sweet balsamic on top. \u00a0The flavors and textures were perfect!The goat cheese, apple, fois gras dish was amazing. It comes with sweet cracker biscuits that perfectly complemented the spread. Perfect combination of sweet and savoury. The paella was probably the best paella I've ever had. \u00a0It was packed with seafood! They warn you that it takes about 30 minutes to make, but it was well worth the wait.My favorite dish was the shrimp in garlic oil. If you come here, you HAVE to order this. The prawns were large, tender, and bathed in a garlic oil that was out of this world. \u00a0I would come back to Barcelona for this dish alone!",
