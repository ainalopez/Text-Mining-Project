    "I don't like to give five stars but this was definitely a 4.5 experience shaded to 5 and the current overall rating does not do it justice. It was busy and we wanted tapas. They had a restaurant menu and we were actually thinking to leave. Plus, being a taxi driver brought us there, I assume a tourist trap. Instead, they made us whatever we wanted. It is a cute, cozy old steakhouse feel. We had fried calamari, fried fish (like smelts), saut\u00e9ed octopus and saut\u00e9ed clams. They gave us excellent bread and charcuterie to include the best prosciutto we have had yet (not salty like most Spanish prosciutto) everything was extremely fresh, great quality and fast. Waiter was excellent! We got some complimentary after meal drinks (don't know name but like \u00a0lemoncello and grappa had a baby) and little complimentary desert. It is worth the taxi back from midtown just to eat there again.",
