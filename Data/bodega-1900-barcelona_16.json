    "Gourmet tapas in cosy and unpretentious restaurant. The best food we got since we moved to Barcelona 1 month ago.We asked the waiter to make a \"selection de la case\" with priority on seafood, joined by a bottle of cava.The tapas was creative and very nice looking but most important, tasted very good. Most of the seafood was cooked very lightly or not at all.Examples: Sea Anemone in tempura batter and very small shrimps a la plancha, to be consumed with shells.Not exactly a cheap restaurant, but it's really worth the money.Waiters are attentive, good at giving advice and friendly.A place to return to when gourmet tapas are needed.",
