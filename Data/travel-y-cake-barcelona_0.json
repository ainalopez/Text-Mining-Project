    "4.5 stars. -.5 ITS EXTREMELY BUSY. I think you would always have to wait at least 15 minutes to get seated. We waited 30.I got a white americano and the super sandwich. The sandwich was awesome. It was placed on top of a stack of tortilla chips, next to a guac syringe. Piled high with spiced chicken and various veggies. It was great :) This is supposed to be exactly the same as Brunch&Cake but i've never tried that so i don't know how it compares. But it's awesome overall.",
