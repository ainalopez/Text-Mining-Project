    "The real deal. This place oozes authenticity, and has been a local mainstay for decades. No pretense, nothing flashy. Just fresh, expertly devised tapas, served by generations of experience. We had pretty much everything, as we were with our Catalan hosts. Decades of boxing photos and memorabilia above the bar, and as super graphics high on the wall. My suggestion is to have someone with you to order in Catalan, to guarantee the experience. Highly, highly recommended. Feels like a locals only place, so waves of tourists are somewhat out of sync. It IS a locals place, but happy to serve all.",
