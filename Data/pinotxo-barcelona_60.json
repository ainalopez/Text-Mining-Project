    "This was the most magical meal of our trip through Spain. We almost skipped it when we saw the hordes of people crowding around the dozen bar stools, awaiting their turn at the counter. We are so glad that we stuck with it though because our wait was surprisingly short and the experience was totally worth it. The owner himself (Juanito, but goes by the nickname Pinotxo) ushered us over with a warm smile, served up a cerveza to my husband and a perfect glass of cava to me, and then went to work coming up with dishes to please our palates. Unfortunately, we weren't starving, so we couldn't eat everything that caught our eye. We let Pinotxo call the shots, giving us the freshest, sweetest prawns I've ever had, simply prepared with olive oil and salt, as well as a heaping pile of braised rabbit ribs in a rich, unctuous gravy that we sopped up with the bread that Pinotxo plopped down on our placemats. Oh my word. I think I died and went to foodie heaven. If only I had discovered a hidden chamber in my stomach, I would have made room for the chickpeas that our dining neighbor inhaled. They are on my must-try list next time...and, yes, there will most definitely be a next time.",
