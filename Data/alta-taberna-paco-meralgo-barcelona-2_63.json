    "perhaps one of the best meals i had on my trip throughout europe. MAKE SURE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS...we waited in line for an hour and half to have two people seated at the bar. But it was so worth it since the tapas were delicious and the service was great. The host remembered my name and would come up to us and ask me how our meal was. Well worth the money too. Got two drinks and 3 tapas for 20 euros. A MUST GO PLACE IN BARCELONA!",
