    "Omgoodness. I love the fresh seafood from this restaurant, \u00a0I've missed it so much! Upon entering the restaurant, it might be a bit confusing, but the process is - pick the items you want, there will probably 2 different options on how they cook each item, and wait for them to call your number. My friends and i fell in love with the freshness of the seafood. The prices were also very good for all we ordered. About 70 euros for 4 people with a bottle of wine.I will definitely be back on my next trip to BCN.",
