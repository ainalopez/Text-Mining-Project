    "Had the asparagus appetizer (4.5 stars), goat cheese salad (5 stars) and paella (3.5 stars). The restaurant felt a bit touristy. I felt a little put off by menu being in a bunch of different languages and the fact that everyone around me seemed to be from somewhere outside Spain. \u00a0Good place to eat but not necessarily if you are looking for an authentic experience.",
