    "We'd gotten restaurant reservations for El Bulli and decided to make of week of it...dining in the Barcelona region of Spain. One place we booked we'd heard little about other than some glowing on-line reviews. Chef Jordi Cruz has brought a Michelin stars to this gorgeous restaurant.The service was spectacular. Outside of El Bulli, this was the best meal I've enjoyed this year. Highest possible recommendation.",
