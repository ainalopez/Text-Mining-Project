    "I came here for dinner and was a bit disappointed. It looked cozy and authentic with a promise of a delicious meal, I was so looking for. First of all, 2 items that were on the menu and I particularly wanted were NOT available for some reason. Ok, moving on, ordered something else instead. Ceviche was pretty bland and i'm not sure you can even call it ceviche. It was chopped fish in a vinegary sauce. Not impressed. Seaweed and tofu salad on the other hand was beautiful, yummy and refreshing. Unagi was particularly fresh but bony..One of the rolls was good, I think it was spicy salmon but rather then that all rolls were either fried or had cream cheese and I wasn't even interested in trying them. That sums it up, it's also pricy for the food and service they provide.",
