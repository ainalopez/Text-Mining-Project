    "Apparently I wasn't the only one craving a hot bowl of noodle-y soup yesterday... There was a line halfway up the block by the time I arrived at 2:15 for lunch. \u00a0Granted, the place is tiny. \u00a0I don't think we would have gotten a table if it wasn't for the holiday (as they normally turn away diners who aren't seated by 3:30 - we didn't get seated until nearly 4). Robert M, Frank & I shared a plate of Gyoza, which is made in-house, and was excellent. \u00a0I ordered the Miso Ramen, with egg and bamboo shoots. \u00a0I wanted extra pork, but it was sold out. \u00a0The broth was thick and rich. \u00a0Perhaps a bit too thick for my taste (translation: \u00a0I was drinking so much water that afternoon! it must have been sky high with sodium too). \u00a0What would have made the soup just a tiny bit better would have been if it was served hotter. \u00a0I like it hot. \u00a0Scalding hot. \u00a0Like I need to wait and blow on it for a while before I start. \u00a0This was immediately edible, meaning it was too cold by the time I was near the end. \u00a0I'll definitely come here again when craving ramen. \u00a0Hopefully I'll arrive early enough to not have to wait over an hour for a table. \u00a0It's a good thing I had a little snack before venturing off to lunch - I'd have been way too grumpy if I was overly hungry.",
