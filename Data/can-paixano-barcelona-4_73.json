    "A series of coincidences, or maybe call it fate, brought my sisters and me to this literal hole in the wall. Without even a sign outside to proclaim its name, can paixano can only be identified by glancing in and seeing the mass crowd of people gathered around a bar surrounded by hanging meats and laden with small glasses of a deep rose colored cava. We were intimidated by the menu (purely in Catalan) but decided it was time to explore. I ordered the Jamon y Camembert, ham and gooey cheese served in a warm toasted bun. One of my sisters had the Serrano something and something. At first, when she opened her bun, she found a tongue like object staring back at her. I convinced her to try a bite and that was how we discovered Serrano is pepper, not tongue. Lol. My other sis had the hamguersa with bacon and queso. This was definitely my favorite of the three - I don't know what type of meat they use but that burger was one of the best I've ever had. The cava too was delicious. It tasted kind of like a bubbly champagne but less sweet and more rich like a red. A classic stop in Barcelona!",
