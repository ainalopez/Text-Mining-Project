    "I had dinner here 2 nights in a row when I stayed in Barcelona in June of 2014. \u00a0The food was awesome, the ambience was super cool and you can even write on a title on the wall to capture your experience in Barcelona! \u00a0I sat at the bar one night and the bartends made me amazing Spanish cocktails with Juniper berries and gave me a complimentary shot of a crazy aperitif with flames on the bottle that translated to \"caution, fire\". \u00a0The tuna was amazing and served in a cute tin and the dessert was incredible--corn ice cream drizzled with bourbon and, topped with bourbon covered caramelized popcorn and berries.This is a must when in Barcelona. \u00a0It is in a great neighborhood and walking distance to some of the best shopping, clubs and fanciest hotels in the city.",
