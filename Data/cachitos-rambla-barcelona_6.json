    "We randomly selected this spot on our last night in Barcelona. It looked good and we wanted to sit somewhere with outdoor seating. We waited about 15 mins around 11:30pm. I really enjoyed the food here! We had a foie gras pasta and slider and it was really good! My favorite paella was actually from here which was the shrimp and garlic paella. For dessert we opt for the raspberry cheesecake. It was a great last meal to end our trip.",
