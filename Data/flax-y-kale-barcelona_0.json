    "Although far from popular touristic tracs, this place is a hidden gem. Now we visited it several times at different times and it's our favourite spot in BCN. Nice healthy choice of food and drinks. Great atmosphere. They have different menu at different times of day or week. There is a weekday breakfast menu from 09-12 , lunch and dinner for weekdays, weekend brunch and even light after work option for weekdays only. They all sightly differ a bit. You need to book a table for dinner as it gets crowded. Healthy choice of different vegeterian and vegan food , anything from fantastic quinoa pankackes for breakfast to veggie burger.My favourite starters are avocado toast and mezze plato, and you must try Zuccini Blossoms !If you want something for you pleasure try carrot cake !Finally I recommed other restaurants owned by same founder Teresa, which you can ask for at Flax&Kalle",
