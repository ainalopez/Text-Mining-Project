    "Excellent for tapas...right next to the sensational \"Market\" - Mercat de Santa Caterina. \u00a0You can sit outside, at the bar (lots of seating) or in the well decorated restaurant. \u00a0The decor is unique and beautiful. The restaurant serves all fresh food from the market and the menu is rather different...with a ton of different tapas offerings (and some truly amazing olives, pickles and salmon appetizers). \u00a0Great food and wine selection. \u00a0Staff speak multiple languages and are friendly and helpful. The market and restaurant were renovated into a very modern design - great architecture. \u00a0Worth a visit.",
