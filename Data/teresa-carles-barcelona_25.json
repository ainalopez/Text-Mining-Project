    "Absolutely loved everything we got!! Healthy nachos, salad and aubergine layered cake, all so tasty healthy and delicious! Left there feeling guilt free. I would suggest making a reservation. \u00a0Also, the warm kitchen doesn't open up until after 730pm, but their salads and cold menu is still available. Great find while in Barcelona!",
