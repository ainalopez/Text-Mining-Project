    "Shoddy service. Shoddy starters (cold). \u00a0Wine list is boring. Nice ambience both inside and out. Mains are better. Tiki chicken Marsala and paella are nice. Skip the sausage and mushroom dish. Very good simple deserts. Catalan custard br\u00fbl\u00e9e and white chocolate cake are great.Very well priced and probably decent value for the money. But couldn't get over the feeling they were mailing it in for the touristy August crowd - trying to turn the table as often as they could. I'd pass and try to find something better a little further away from Los Ramblas.",
