    "Great food at a superb price. We paid 25 euros for a three course dinner menu with lots of choices. Wine or sangria is included. Friendly waiters, English menu is available. Nice dining room, space to accommodate larger groups. Really good food for the price. Grilled octopus was tender and black rice was rich and perfect. Good place to try out good quality Spanish food without breaking the bank.",
