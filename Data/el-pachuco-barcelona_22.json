    "This restaurant was excellent! We were the only customers early on a Thursday evening, and the one employee that was working made all of our food. We got the large nacho dish and bean and cheese quesadillas. The nachos were incredible! So many lovely, fresh toppings, and a generous amount of food. The quesadillas were also superb, and came with guacamole. We could see the cool grating the cheese fresh for both dishes, and taking his time to make the food delicious!",
