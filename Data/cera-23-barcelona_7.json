    "Omg!Totally amazed at this Yelp find by my daughter. \u00a0Ceres 23 was a delight from start to finish. We did not have a reservation, but they found a way to fit us in. Starters consisting of ceviche, squid and shrimp were all delectable. \u00a0My main was the lamb which was not only melt in your mouth texture, but amazingly delicious with a perfect balance of flavors, and wonderfully displayed. \u00a0I can't say enough great things about this restaurant. On all fronts, service, atmosphere and quality of food Ceres 23 is an act to follow.",
