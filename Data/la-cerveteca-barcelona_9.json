    "Husband and I happened to stumble into this dive bar as we were walking around in the Barri Gothic district looking for another bar. Have to say that this atmosphere reminded us of a great dive bar that we go to a lot back at home in the states. The tables were made of Barrels which I absolutely loved. They have an excellent selection of beers and different drafts. What amazed me was that they carried one of my favorite beers called Morimoto Soba Ale that is almost impossible to find anywhere. Two thumbs up for this bar. Seating is limited to a few seats and table in the back but otherwise expect to stand around.",
