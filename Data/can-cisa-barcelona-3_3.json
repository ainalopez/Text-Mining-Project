    "What a great place! I was in Bcn during the off-week with a group of friends, and as we had not idea where to have dinner that first night, of course I checked Yelp and try to find something pretty close from the place we were staying at. Can Cesa appeared to be the One: 2min walking in the Born area, let's go.Annnd...we were not disappointed at all! I loved the place at first sight: large wooden tables, visible wine cellar, and cosy and friendly atmosphere. We ordered different tapas and mains to be able to share and taste the maximum. I cannot remember something I wouldn't like! Everything was tasty and delicious. Tapas are qualitative and uncommon. Just one remark about the quantities...they could have been a bit more generous. Especially for the men at the table, who were still a bit hungry at the end. But maybe it is also because we were literally starving :-) Anyway, definitely a place I keep in mind for my next trip in Barcelona!",
