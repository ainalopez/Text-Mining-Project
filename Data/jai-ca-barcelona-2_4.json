    "This place didn't wow us. \u00a0Service was alright. \u00a0Not overly friendly but not abrupt either. \u00a0The food was alright. \u00a0My favourite dish was the padron peppers. \u00a0Perfect! \u00a0The razor clams were too gritty. \u00a0I was spoiled from this morning's experience. \u00a0The bombas were okay. \u00a0My husband liked them better than I did. \u00a0We also tried the anchovy with fried bone. \u00a0Not bad. \u00a0The free olives were actually pretty good. \u00a0The prices were fair. \u00a0All in all, it was A-OK.",
