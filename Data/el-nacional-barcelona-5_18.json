    "What a gorgeous venue with multiple restaurants under one roof! \u00a0It had such lovely architectural style and accents to highlight the various restaurants. \u00a0We went to the seafood restaurant towards the back for seafood, paella and cava. \u00a0Service was nice and attentive, an pd we were so impressed with the look of this venue. \u00a0It would be a perfect date spot!",
