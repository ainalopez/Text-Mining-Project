    "If there is one of you... two at most, then El Quim is a little troublesome, but well worth the effort, since the food is delicious from start to finish. We, a hungry trio, attempted to eat there and ended up with a single chair to share, our plates perched precariously at the end of the banquette in front of the support column. More seats did not become available- or rather they did but our effort to seat the rest of us resulted in utter failure as a couple shoved past to grab the half-vacated seats while our neighbors paid their tab and moved to go. It was uncomfortable and frustrating, which cast a certain pall over the meal itself despite the quality of the cooking.",
