    "Great tapas, good Sangria and disappointing paella. Average out for 3 stars but its the paella that really brings it down. We got the seafood paella and it had a couple shrimp, some white fish and well done octopus. It was a brown color and had very little flavor. Perhaps our expectations were off because of paella we've had in the U.S., but it was just bland. The tapas were great- Iberian ham egg and potatoes, the ham croquette and octopus tapas were delicious. The paella just disappointed. Hoping we can find some better paella during our trip.",
