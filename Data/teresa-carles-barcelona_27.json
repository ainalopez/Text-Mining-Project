    "Not the kind of cuisine I prefer and I expected something different but I have to admit that the food quality is high.The place is nice low light (perhaps a bit too low: I had to use the telephone torch to read the menu!!)Not cheap but a \u00a0good value for money. 5 star to the personnel: professional, efficient but extremely polite and friendly.",
