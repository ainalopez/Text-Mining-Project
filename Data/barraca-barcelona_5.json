    "If I lived in Spain, I would be a regular at this restaurant -- the food is excellent and the service is fantastic. An American friend recommended this restaurant over a year ago and I finally got to go during my trip to Barcelona. The paella was absolutely delicious, and so were the cod fritters. The host was really wonderful, spending time with me and my husband discussing the best way to cook paella after he found out I love to cook. The waitress spoke great English and was very professional. Highly recommended.",
