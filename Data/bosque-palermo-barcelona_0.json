    "Delicious paella, refreshing sangria, and fantastic service! I went here twice while in Barcelona (I was only here for a 4 days), each time for dinner, because it was that good! Definitely make a reservation, or you'll end up waiting 15-30 minutes for a table because the space is very cozy and there aren't many tables. However, if you end up waiting, you can take a spot at the bar and get a head start on your sangria!As for food, I ordered the same thing each time (bad form, I know, but SO worth it): a meat paella and seafood paella and each time my mind was blown by how good it was! It's a bit of a wait, but I took that as a sign that the food was being freshly made. The flavors in the paella are so rich, and each dish gives a generous serving of seafood/meat. As an added bonus: they have 4 euro bottles of house wine!",
