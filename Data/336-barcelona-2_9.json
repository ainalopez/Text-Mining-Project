    "We had lunch here for their 4.5 star review and it was a great choice! The food was delicious, I love everything I had, especially spegetti and steak. The food is five star - no doubt. I can't believe it's only 13 euro for 3 courses (actually 4 courses because coffee is included too). The only downside is no English menu... The stuff tried very hard to explain but still hard to understand :(",
