    "Empanadas - beef & cheese!This place is so much fun. \u00a0I only wish we had a vibrant outdoor market with food bars here in the Bay Area.You grab a seat on a first come first serve basis and you need to eat quickly, because there are people hovering, just waiting to grab your seat when you're done. \u00a0Service is friendly and they make whatever is fresh. \u00a0You need to be ok with them throwing live seafood on the grill or in the pot. \u00a0And, the menu changes so ask what's fresh and then be open to whatever lands on your plate. \u00a0The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's expensive. \u00a0You're paying top notch price for the location and the experience.Happy travels!",
