    "Got the whole wheat noodles with chicken and peanut sauce. I then realized I had forgotten I love spicy food and asked how much more it would be to add spicy sauce so they added it at no charge. Solomente sies euros!! Tasted like everything and more than expected. For a disclaimer I was pretty hungry but this definitely left me feeling satisfied, especially since I've grown to like the taste of whole wheat over white.",
