    "I give this place 3 stars with mixed feelings. Going to Cat Bar, it was exactly what I expected. Small \u00a0beer bar with a good Vegan Burger selection with a killer side of fries.So why the 3 stars?1. While the burgers were a good size, Vegan, and overall one of the better burgers I've had, still not sure it was an \u20ac8 burger.2. The waitress was either REALLY bad at math, trying to rip us off or both. The first time the check came out, she had marked down 3 beers, but charged for 4. When we pointed out that my husband had only had 2, the waitress got a bit snotty, took the check back, removed the extra beer, but the total was still wrong! At that point we decided to pay and considered the extra as her tip.Based on our experience, we wouldn't go back as there are a ton of great Vegan places in Barcelona, several of which serve a great burger.",
