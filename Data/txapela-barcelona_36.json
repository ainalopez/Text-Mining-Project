    "HIt this place twice during a short stay. \u00a0There was really a good variety of tapas and I knew that the popularity of the place would assure fresh food. \u00a0Perhaps coming during the height of tourist season helped. \u00a0It seems I was right. Tapas are often made ahead, otherwise it would be a ridiculous amount of work trying to keep up with demand during busy times, so if that bothers you, then pick a different sort of place. \u00a0The bread was not stale. \u00a0It was like melba toast. \u00a0If you want overstuffed sandwiches, this is not the place. \u00a0If you want what you're used to, then don't travel or just hit the local branches MacD. KFC, BK or Subway. \u00a0I thought the servers coped with the volume of business pretty well and were open to translating as best they could. \u00a0There is a printed menu with translations, as well.I would have liked more variety of beers available, but Bittberg was ok. \u00a0In terms of variety, price and quality, Txapela was fine.",
