    "I don't get the hype. Unless it is your first day in Barcelona and you have had zero opportunity to get out of the tourist area, I see no reason why you would 1. Consider this a quality meal and 2. Think this is anywhere close to the appropriate price point. \u00a0There are a 1000 places in Barcelona that you will find better quality for a WAY better price point. \u00a0Seriously, 22 euros for fried eggs and squid. I should have gotten up the moment I saw the menu, but I decided to remain and see if they could prove to me the price to quality value. \u00a0It really was 2 fried eggs with about 3 euros worth of squid thrown on top. \u00a0Save your money and venture to Poble Sec or Gracia for far better food at an appropriate price!",
