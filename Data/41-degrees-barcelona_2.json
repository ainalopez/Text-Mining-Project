    "Heavenly food but in a strange and surreal atmosphere.First, you need to book here in advance. \u00a0They require a 50euro deposit per person which is applied to the meal when you actually eat here.When you walk in, it kind of makes you think someone might have smoked something while designing the decor. \u00a0Weird and wasn't really my taste but whatever. \u00a0The food was worth going for. \u00a0FYI, it is 41 courses of food with some cocktails included. \u00a0They will email you ahead of time as well as confirm when you get there whether you drink (the cocktails become mocktails if you don't drink). \u00a0The plates are artistically composed and makes you almost sad to eat it. \u00a0Otherwise, despite 41 courses, they are all small bites so you won't feel horrendously full when you finish. \u00a0Also, you don't need to remember everything because they give you a printed menu at the end.If you don't like molecular gastronomy, don't come here. \u00a0They combine interesting flavors with molecular gastronomy. \u00a0Was I glad I went? Definitely... \u00a0Would I go again? Maybe, but mostly just due to the expense...hard to justify that kind of meal on a daily basis but I would go again to take others there.",
