    "Sensi is a great little place that we found because of other yelpers. The reviews under-sold how amazing the food was at this place. We started with delicious sangria. \u00a0We had the chorizo, ducks, mussels, pork and they were all amazing. Do not miss those tapas, palleala was just alright in comparison to the other dishes. \u00a0We have been trying to decide which tapa was our favorite and we can't decide, great problem \u00a0We had a great relaxing dinner. Wait staff was nice and knowledgable, but left us alone. \u00a0Great spot right outside of the craziness of las rambles. \u00a0Loved it and will go again.",
