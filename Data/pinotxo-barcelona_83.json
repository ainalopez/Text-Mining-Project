    "This place is the bomb diggity! \u00a0By far, THE BEST meal we had in Barcelona, and rivals some of the best meals I've had in my lifetime.Let the owner (who is super cute...I just wanted to pinch his cheeks!) or the staff take it away and order whatever they deem fit for the day...which is basically everything. \u00a0They ask you if you like seafood, meat, etc. etc. and go from there.We had several dishes, all of which were spectacular. \u00a0The gambas (shrimp) and a grilled-till-melted cheese wheel that we paired with crusty bread stood out above the rest. \u00a0The gambas were the freshest shrimp I've ever had...they had probably been alive until they were cooked minutes beforehand since everything at this restaurant is purchased directly from the mercato it's housed in. \u00a0The cheese was absolutely AMAZING! \u00a0So full of flavor, rich and just simply delicious! \u00a0Simplicity at its best.Pinoxto is a tiny establishment with barstools around the kitchen. \u00a0You have to sort of hang out until other patrons leave and be quick to grab their seats!The place is a little pricey and \u00a0we didn't know how much anything was since there really wasn't a menu. \u00a0However, it was totally worth every cent!",
