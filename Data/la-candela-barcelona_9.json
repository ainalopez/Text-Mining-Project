    "This place is right next to the apartment that I'm staying in so it's a great stop for me before I go out or after when I'm on my way home. I ordered the green salad but I asked for tuna on top and the tuna they put on it was incredibly delicious. It was raw marinated tuna and it made the salad 100 times better even though the salad itself was already beautiful. \u00a0 I like this place because it's mostly locals, not very touristy, and so I feel like I'm living part of the Barcelona life. The staff are great- very friendly and attentive. \u00a0Only thing that disappointed me was that they were out of croquetas \u00a0two days in a row.",
