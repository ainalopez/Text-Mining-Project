    "The staff was friendly and helpful. \u00a0It was here that I realized how much I like a cold beer with pintxos. \u00a0Don't be shy. \u00a0Step up to the bar and ask someone in a green shirt for however many plates you need. \u00a0Be ready to tell them what you want to drink as well (Have I mentioned the beer?).Then wander about to your hearts content. \u00a0We opted to stand up. \u00a0What I liked is that they carried hot pintxos (the little tapas bites) around on platters constantly. \u00a0Yes, this location was along one of our tour routes. \u00a0It wasn't too crowded. \u00a0Moreover, the food, atmosphere, beautiful weather, and camaraderie all made for a wonderful experience.",
