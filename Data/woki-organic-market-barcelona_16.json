    "Even though the staff and clerk were incredibly unfriendly and rude, I thoroughly enjoyed my Thai Chicken Rice Wok, that I might have to come back. Also, if you're not ordering to-go, take a seat and they will help you there. The clerk practically scolded me for not knowing that. God forbid it was my first time there! Also, there isn't a lot of walking/sitting room so you get a discount off of your tab if you take it to go...and I recommend taking your meal to a bench near fountain in the center of Pla\u00e7a Catalunya to enjoy the fountain and people watch.",
