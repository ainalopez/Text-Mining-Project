    "To be honest, Ciudad Condal redeemed my family's opinion of tapas. We found this place on Yelp and stopped in on our last night in Barcelona. They show a full bar of liquor, but when my dad tried to order a martini the waiter said, \"beer?\" It might have been a language barrier issue, but we didn't see anyone drinking liquor on our way out. Although we had to wait 30-45 minutes for a table, the outdoor bar serves waiting patrons and there are some cute shops a block up the street (away from Las Rambles) where you can kill time. Dinner was fabulous! A few of the dishes that stood out were the grilled cuttlefish, iberian ham sandwiches - everything was great. Our waitress helped us decide between a few of the things we were considering and guided us to a meal that was well-rounded and not repetitive. Definitely a go-to place for a nicer dinner.",
