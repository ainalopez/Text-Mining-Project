    "Our best meal yet in Barcelona....after the Tapas Trail needed something diff. Just found it. Shrimp, Carpaccio, Grilled Veges and the rarely found in Barcelona....Ensalade....not sure they like the greens in Barcelona and we needed them. Very very good worth the few more euros than most other restaurants!!!!!!",
