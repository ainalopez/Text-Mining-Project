    "This place was so delicious! It was a cute cafe type place and the atmosphere was just right for the food. The food was so good! We had fried green tomatoes, quinoa and potato hashbrowns, Brie and sausage sandwhich, and pancakes. Everything was amazing! Service was good, drinks were good. All good.",
