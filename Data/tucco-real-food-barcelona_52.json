    "5 stars and 80+ reviews, so naturally during our short visit to Barcelona, Tucco's was a must-eat stop. Honestly, this place is incredible... the funny thing is, if we were just walking around looking for somewhere to eat, we would have passed Tucco right by, one reason why Yelp is one of the best things since sliced bread.Lucas, the manager/co-owner was on his game from the minute we stepped in, until the moment we left...He went through the entire menu, step by step with us, since we don't speak a lick of espanol, and we realized how great we were going to eat that night :)I had a special, which was a homemade ravioli filled with pistachio, cheese, and other tasty ingredients.. George had some other type of ravioli filled with meat... both were out of this world... With our meal came an empanada, a glass of wine, and dessert... This pasta was just something I dream about, and the empanada was lovely as well...We thought it would be quite pricey, and both of our meals were under 20 euro. holy crap. Lucas himself made us want to return... We had another day in Barca and we ALMOST went back for dinner again (I wish we did)...This was literally the best meal I had my entire trip... Go Tucco-- I will be back, I promise!",
