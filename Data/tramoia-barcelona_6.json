    "La Tramoia was one of the first places we ate dinner in Barcelona. Conveniently located on Rambla de Catalunya, this place is always busy. We were able to walk in with 8 people and get a table upstairs by the grill without a reservation, but you might want to call ahead. The setting upstairs is more of a sit down fine dining, while downstairs they are known for their tapas bar. The highlights were the grilled peppers, as well as the manchego cheese (which comes in huge slices). The white beans were very delicious as well. The server was incredibly helpful and gave us some recommendations. The house wine was very good too, no need to buy expensive bottles here!",
