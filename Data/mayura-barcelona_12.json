    "Take it from Indians the worst experience of Indian food we ever had is here. The samosas we ordered were 3 days old and sticky. We realized it immediately and didnt eat it. The later the waiter informed us that old samosa was mixed with the new ones and they had given us the bad ones. Very pricy for the taste they offer. Although they have a good decor very traditional look but the food was a waste of money..",
