    "I had a friend in town visiting and we wanted to find a nice place for her last night in town. We stumbled upon Balthazar and had a wonderful meal!For a bottle of cava, one appetizer, two entrees and one dessert, the bill was still less than 20 EUR a person.I would highly reccomend the Duck Confit!",
