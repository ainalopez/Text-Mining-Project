    "I'm not a vegan or even vegetarian but I am always curious and like to try new stuff. I read some of the posts about this food joint from fellow Yelpers and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed!The place itself is easily found in the old town in Barcelona, and it was ironic to find it next to a Greek place that specializes in meat sandwiches :) My only regret is that the place is pretty small so not really made for groups (it's technically not a restaurant though, it's a Deli)As a complete novice in vegan food, I talked to the couter guy and he recommended the millet, and it was... incredible. It REALLY tastes and feels like meat but with this spicy flavor that makes the whole thing melt in your mouth. I tried their green tea but did not really like it (not yet a true vegan). The guy at the counter was really patient and helpful in explaining everything to me based on what I like and gave me the best recommendations. Very good experience, I would definitely come back",
