    "Mmmm do yourself a favor and get the chickpeas and the custard filled croissant donut. Both are the best of both I've ever had! The atmosphere of this bar is great. Both times I went the cooks and the owners were constantly joking around, smiling, and were in general in high spirits. You could tell that they really love their jobs. Food was quick and fresh as they get their produce fresh from the market. A must-do for any visit to Barcelona!",
