    "LOVE THE BURRITOS! About 8 Euros and up. My fav is the Super Carne. Food is delicious and the juices are freshly squeezed. They even have hot sauces for you to try and add to your order. I love Mexican and Tex Mex. They are friendly and can speak English which is always a plus if your Spanish is a little rusty like mine. I haven't found a better burrito place yet.",
