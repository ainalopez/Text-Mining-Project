    "Pretty straightforward and simple bar, with decent, not wonderful food. Bonus points for being right next to the Picasso Museum and self service, but don't think you're going to get blown away by the best tapas that Barcelona has to offer. Price per tapa is a slight overpriced by we're talking centimos here, so it's not all that big of a deal. If you'd rather a proper sit-down experience, walk a bit further into the plaza and go to Origens, which also features authentic organic Catalan small plates and local beer (i.e. Euskal does not- boooooo!).",
