    "This place is a five star food lovers paradise!! \u00a0We stumbled in here after a long day of travel and empty stomachs after a stay in Madrid where we tired of tapas very quickly! \u00a0We were looking forward to a filling, enjoyable meal. \u00a0That's exactly what we got. \u00a0It was before 8pm when we stopped in, and the only server inside told us that they don't start serving food for another 30 minutes or so, but we were welcome to start with a drink. \u00a0That sounded perfectly fine to us. \u00a0We ordered a bottle of wine and the server brought us some much needed flat water. \u00a0He came to take our order and said that he will put the order in and the kitchen will make it when it opens. \u00a0He was great at suggesting items for us to try. \u00a0On his suggestion, we ordered the goat cheese salad, the pasta Bolognese, and the pizza special of the day with mushroom, tomato and olive oil. \u00a0The salad was sensational with large chunks of fresh goat cheese and various vegetables. \u00a0I could not stop raving about the corn on the salad! \u00a0It was the best tasting corn I have ever had! \u00a0Maybe I am just used to eating disgusting GMO corn in the US and I don't really know what corn tastes like. \u00a0Whatever the reason, the salad was absolutely TO DIE FOR! \u00a0The pizza was one of the best I have ever had. \u00a0It didn't have any tomato sauce on it, and it didn't need it. \u00a0It was moist and had a nice crispy crust. \u00a0I am pretty sure I will dream of this meal for many years to come!",
