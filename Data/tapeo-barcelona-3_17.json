    "My fave here in Born! I visited this spot when I last visited Barcelona back in 2011. When I found out it was still open I absolutely marked it on my to do list! Patatas Bravas are a must, beef cheeks are amazinf, squid ink pasta is so yummy and of course croquettes are always a staple here.",
