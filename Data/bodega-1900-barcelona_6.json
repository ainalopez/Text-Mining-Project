    "Just didn't feel this one. It felt a bit more like overpriced U.S. \"tapas\" than something authentic. But hey, at least our overpriced tapas are usually interesting. This was little more than average pan con tomate, a couple thin slices of average manchego (at 7 euros!), a couple decent ham croquetas, a water, an Estrella, and a glass of wine. Oh, and a couple spherified olives that were a bit of a letdown - basically, olives in cute little spoons. There was a cheese with black truffle dish I was interested in, but they didn't have it...and I found little else on the menu to be too compelling. I \u00a0don't have a problem with simple tapas, but close to 50 euros were paid for this. Maybe if we'd done a tasting menu, I would feel differently, but I'm skeptical. And to top it all off, the waiter wasn't particularly friendly.There are Spanish tapas restaurants at home I'd rather go to, let alone elsewhere in Barcelona - you have countless options for this kind of food here, and it seemed to me that the Adria brothers are banking on their name - I've been to other places during my time here, and the others executed this style with a bit more flair, not to mention value.",
