    "We stopped in here based on previous Yelp reviews and we were pleasantly surprised for the most part. This place is a bit pricey but mostly worth it. We had papas bravas that were good but not the best I have had in Spain. We had the padr\u00f3n peppers and they were absolutely delicious! They were perfectly seasoned and amazing. We had the buratta and three tomatoes upon suggestion by the waitress and I would not recommend these. They were overpriced and the cheese was very watery. I was disappointed that we were suggested this option. We finished our meal with the truffle ravioli. It was so rich but it was fantastic! We were so full by the end so we couldn't quite finish but it was still amazing. Overall good experience, the environment is adorable and the wait staff are very kind and helpful!",
