    "When we were in Barcelona we had paella everyday - sometimes twice a day. I have to say that this was definitely the best seafood paella that we had on the trip. Also, the cava sangria was super tasty. Be ready for a longish wait, but you can pass the time at one of the tables in front with fresh sangria made-to-order. The ambiance is also really cool - they let you know which famous people have dined at your table before!",
