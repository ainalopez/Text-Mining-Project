    "There are so many doors on this corner building I must have looked like an idiot trying \u00a0to pull on one closed door after another. \u00a0This place is cash only. \u00a0Padron Peppers are good everywhere in Spain and if you haven't tried it yet, now would be a good time to try it. \u00a0The beef here is definitely special. \u00a0It has a very earthy taste to it as if the cow was happily grass feeding in the open and now it rests in my belly and I feel just as happy. \u00a0I think the foie gras can be skipped as it can be had everywhere in Spain. \u00a0The way they served it was a slab or two grilled and topped with grilled onions...overall, nothing special and it was on the pricier side.",
