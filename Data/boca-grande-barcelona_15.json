    "My girlfriend and I decided to try this place for our last night at Barcelona, and we were very disappointed. As soon as we walked in, the hostess looked us up and down and told us there were no tables available if we didn't have reservations, we asked her if we can wait at the bar and she said no because no tables will be available later. Then, we were about to leave and my friend decided to ask the doorman since he was nice to us and recommended we try this place. He goes in and talks to the hostess and suddenly, we are allowed to wait at the bar while our table is getting ready. We go to the bar, to be fair, the bar staff were nice. When we got to our table, we ask for an English menu and our request gets ignored, we ask another staff member and he get is for us. The waiter is not friendly, doesn't smile at all. The waiter never comes and checks on us. Anyway, overall it wasn't a great experience. Compared to all the restaurants we have been, this place was horrible. Also, the food was not great, given the high price. Nice ambiance though.",
