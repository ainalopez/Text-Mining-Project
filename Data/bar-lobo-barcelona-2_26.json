    "Fabulous lunch spot! The tapas selection is extensive and unique. We had grilled artichoke sprinkled with chopped bacon, fried eggplant slices drizzled with honey, meatballs and squid in gravy, and hummus and fresh pita bread. I indulged in a glass of sangria, as well. We sat inside to enjoy the air conditioning near the opened door. A Spanish guitarist on the patio added to the ambiance. Perfect!",
