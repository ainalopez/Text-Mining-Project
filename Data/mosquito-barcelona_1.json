    "The place was a bit overrated, hypsterish vibe with asians cooking, great selection of beers but not much choise for non-beer drinkers... we also arrived at about 18:50 and were told the kitchen wasnt open yet(too used to London times...) it quickly became packed with tourists and locals. we over ordered(as usual), the pork dumplings were quite nice, the shrimp ones however, were mediocre at best, no real shrimp inside but some kind of a shrimp paste. The kimchi was very disappointing, overly salted and spicy with no real flavour or fermented zestiness.the fried duck(#2) was very nice, a bit on the dry side but thats okay, we also ordered Sichuan pepper beef which quite honestly was average at best. \u00a0Not sure how the asian food scene is in BCN but quite frankly this didnt impress.",
