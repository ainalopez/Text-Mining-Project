    "Wow.One of my best eating experiences in Barcelona and a meal I will remember for a long time. I was lucky to be able to walk on in without a reservation and proceeded to have a decadent feast, served by friendly staff eager to explain the elements of each dish.The double egg souffle on a bed of potato \"ribbons\" was a textural delight, the flavours understated and perfectly balanced. The sardine and pork belly with a smear of peanut \"paste\" underneath was crazy good - all raw elements and served on a very hot plate, the fattiness of each started to melt and created an interesting experience in my mouth, everything sticking to my teeth as if I had eaten a spoon of peanut butter directly from the jar.I ate, I think, around nine courses and all were beautifully made. Each playful, yet restrained at the same time, showcasing textures and flavour in a clever way and demonstrating the mad skills that are in the kitchen. The wine list was incredible, if you were buying from the bottle. Unfortunately I was dining solo so I stuck to wine by the glass and was limited to just a few choices. I'd love to come with a few friends and demolish some of the full bottles with another fabulous meal.Why this place isn't packed I don't know! For the (very reasonable) price it is certainly a must do for any food lover who is visiting Barcelona.",
