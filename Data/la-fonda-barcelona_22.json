    "It's funny when you walk into a place and expect it to be a tourist trap. It's like you know what to expect. This place is so close to La Rambla that you just expect it to be terrible. But we were hungry. And the braised veal cheeks sounded delicious. So we went for it.We were pleasantly surprised. They definitely try to class it up a bit with the decor and table linens. We both ordered the veal cheeks and I had the mixed starters (basically a bunch of different things you would get at a tapas restaurant) and the other half had the leek pie. The leek pie was clearly the winner. It looked a bit burnt when it came out but the filling was so delicious I was kind of jealous. Although the quiche on my plate was actually quite good too, so at least some of the stuff on the mixed starter was good. The veal cheeks were delicious. A port wine sauce with potatoes. I ate it all and was so full afterwards. Luckily I had the smaller portion because the other plate of veal cheeks looked to be twice the size of mine.The service was a bit worse than the usual Spanish service I think. They charged us for bread (which we didn't order nor did we receive) and they kept forgetting to bring our water. But the food was good enough that it didn't really bother us. And the wine was fairly good too.So all in all I was pleasantly surprised with La Fonda except I couldn't stop thinking about the wedding in Napoleon Dynamite the whole time. You know what I mean.",
