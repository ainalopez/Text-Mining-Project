    "This place was very interesting. I actually thought it was a wine shop because of its entrance and walked around trying to find the place using the Yelp map aimlessly. The wines are all unfiltered and natural. I had the steak tartar which was minced not chopped. It was flavourful but an odd texture.I also had the scallops which were so tiny for 9 Euros it really didn't seem worth it to order.Service was great. I enjoyed the experience",
