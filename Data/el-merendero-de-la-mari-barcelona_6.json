    "Let me start by saying that we had a great time at this seafood restaurant. The place is quite nice and cosy, the service attentive AND they serve a killer coffee.So why do I rate it only 3?Well, first of all the tuna served with the Ni\u00e7oise salad was canned, not the best of signs in a seafood restaurant. The prawn croquettes were pretty soggy and texture less, and the calamari was very chewy and rubbery. My partner had the beef carpaccio which was - weird enough in a seafood restaurant - absolutely delicious. My rating mostly reflects the fact that we had a great time in a cosy place - if you're seriousmy i to seafood there are better options to chose from in Barcelona.",
