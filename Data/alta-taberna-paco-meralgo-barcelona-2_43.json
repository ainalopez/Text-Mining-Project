    "This place is one of few restaurants opens Sunday afternoon. Packed with locals: A very GOOD sign to start with :)We seated AGAINST the counter that we could see no fresh, beautiful seafood. Menu, of course, was either in Spanish or Catalan...The plates we ordered was disappointing :(\"Help us out!\" but our waiter said, \"Everything is good here!\" (Sure--Sigh...)Again, be sure to bring a local or seat at the counter!I am sure this restaurant is good...",
