    "If you're looking for an authentic Turkish doner kebab joint, this is your place. Kapadokya is one of only a handful of doner places locals recommend that are traditional and run by Turks. They also serve, borek, a flaky pastry filled with cheese, meat, vegetables and/or herbs. We ordered the cheese borek and it reminded me of the ones I ate on the street in Germany and Croatia. Kapakokya is both inexpensive, tasty and authentic. A Barcelona must if you're looking to switch things up from typical Catalan food.",
