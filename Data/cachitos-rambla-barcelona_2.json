    "A friend of my brother-in-law recommended we come here and it was really nice! \u00a0Both inside and outside seating is available, though inside has a far moodier atmosphere. \u00a0We started with cava, patatas bravas (they put the aioli and paprika sauces on the side, so I could dip into the paprika), and bread with tomato, my favorite Spanish vegan tapas. \u00a0They had a vegetarian paella which was really delicious, though I did forget to confirm whether or not they used vegetable stock. \u00a0Rookie move, I know. \u00a0It's definitely worth inquiring about, though!When we went, it was truffle season and they had an entire menu dedicated to truffles. \u00a0Normally, dishes like these would run you about $75-100 in the US, but here they were only about $35-45! \u00a0I didn't indulge, since I wasn't paying for the meal and it's still pricey, but next time I'm in Europe during truffle season, I definitely gotta get on that.",
