    "My girlfriend and I ate here on our last night in Barcelona and it was excellent. The food was above average, we had the Argentinian skewer, potatoes bravas, grilled artichokes, calamari and corn ice cream. Would recommend them all. More than that though, the service was above and beyond. By far the best service we had in Barcelona and truthfully some of the best service either of us have had in our lives. Would highly recommend.",
