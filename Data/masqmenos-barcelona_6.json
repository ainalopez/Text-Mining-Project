    "This place is FANSTASTIC! Especially if you are a meat lover like us! You can find some of the best cured meats, small plates and beer / wine in town. We did not ask for sangria, so not sure they serve it, but you can check it on the web site if interested. We came to this place after a very sub par experience at Tapas 24. Ordered the platter with cured meats, which came along with 4 pieces of bread covered with toamatoes and olive oil (which was not supposed \u00a0to be included based on menue). We tried the red wine and beer, both quite nice and fairly priced. Service was very good and personal. One staff memeber spoke English and she was pretty good at it. Rest of staff were all smiles.We are definitely going to MasQMenos again tomorrow for our last dinner in Barcelona. It was such a treat to find this place that we want to experience it once more before we go :)",
