    "As a South American, I was very happy to find this place. My boyfriend and I had had a day of hell so nothing like a big piece of steak with potatoes (best type of comfort food out there) to make us feel wholesome again. We arrived at the perfect time because literally five minutes later, this tiny place was packed (late September, Friday around 9pm) Our waiter was very nice.",
