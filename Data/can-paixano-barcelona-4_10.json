    "A bustling place full of people enjoying good value food & drink. Try the Spanish sausage (the sample tapas plate is a good place to start), a ham sandwich, and wash it down with a glass of cava. You'll have an authentic experience, even if the lack of English is a little daunting.You can also take away for a quieter experience, but you won't be able to eat the takeaway standing outside the restaurant (this is officially prohibited).",
