    "I'm going to join the bandwagon and say this one of the best meals I had in Barcelona.I took the chance of heading here for lunch and hour before closing and found one seat empty where I could throw my bag down and get ready to pig out. A plate of headcheese with pickled vegetables later accompanied by a delicious cava. Every bite was flavorful, acidic and perfectly seasoned. I was stuffed with one dish, but the smooth talking guys made a case for the bacalao. The bacalo did not disappoint, it was fried, juicy, seasoned oh-so-perfectly and garnished with an amazing assortment of stewed vegetables that balanced the dish. Oh, what an amazing meal, don't miss this foodie delight in Barcelona!",
