    "Got here by coincidence while walking through Barcelona. We are so glad we did! Enjoyed several tapas...all great! Good wine selection and reasonable prices. The plaza ambiance helps a lot...since there is a fair amount of people at the plaza most times. Very nice dinner and service. Cant wait to return!!!",
