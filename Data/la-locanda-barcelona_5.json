    "Note the restaurant is open 1-4 than closed for siesta and reopened at 8pm for dinner. We tried to go the first night but we were hungry and it was so early. We made reservations but it was just after 8 so they just reopened and weren't too busy yet. Food was great my hubby got a pizza and I got mushroom chicken and it was delicious. It was a great price considering most of the places near by we're more pricey. Pizza was 9 euro chicken was 10 euro and big portions. House wine was 3.20 euro. I would def. go back and recommend if your in the area to check it out",
