    "We decided to walk from Gothic quoter to Sagrada Familia with our 3 girls (age 6 to 9) at some point we got hungry and almost randomly decided to have lunch at this place. \u00a0 What a great decision that was. \u00a0 We had several dishes: ground pork, \u00a0blood pudding, \u00a0chorizo, \u00a0pernil and sangria. \u00a0This was our 3rd day in Barcelona and we had several disappointing restaurant experiences in Gothic quoter countrary this was our first happy meal :)",
