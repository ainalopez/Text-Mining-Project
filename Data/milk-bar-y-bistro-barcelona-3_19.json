    "After vacationing in Dublin and London we were desperate for some good food!! We ended up at Milk twice during our stay, once for breakfast (Eggs Florentine and Salmon Eggs Benedict were great) and once for dinner (Super Super Salad - which is mostly grains - and Veggie Spring Rolls - which had a heavy curry flavor). Both times we left full and happy, servers are super friendly and atmosphere and music are relaxed. Highly recommend!!",
