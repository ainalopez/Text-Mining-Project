    "This was actually our 2nd time to eat here: the first being 2 days ago for late brunch/ early lunch. The spread that morning is what you see in the pictures I posted, fresh and a more extensive selection. The nighttime spread was less, though not in flavor nor desirability haha As we went for a second round they graciously brought out a few new dishes of hot tapas, the ones we got were the mushroom & ham pizza and a chorizo with fried green pepper both very good and satisfying! Service like the first time was quick & helpful, offering our beverages immediately as we sat and coming to check on us when needed. The only reason I gave them 4 was the less selection at night. Other than that we were happy with our dining experience hence, our return.",
