    "if i didn't know better, i thought i was in a circus tent or psychedelic spanish version of 'alice in wonderland' with the the mushroom decor towards the rear of the cafe + in the lower level. \u00a0this decor was the first thing that struck me once entering the cafe for some morning joe. \u00a0and it's the lasting impression of the place.we had an espresso (me), cappuccino (husband) + shared a classic croissant during the earlier hours of a sunday morning. \u00a0PRO: they're open on sundays! YAY! \u00a0our coffees were served in quintessential cups + saucers (the types served at fancy-pantsie english tea houses in the U.S.). \u00a0we sat at a table towards the rear where we could look down to the lower level that had larger tables, including a picnic-sized table where kids were playing on iPads (no, seriously) provided by the cafe. \u00a0this same 'kids table' had coloring apparatus (paper, crayons, markers) for the children to get creative if they weren't already playing on the 6 provided iPads (when did espa\u00f1a coffee places get more tech-y than our U.S. cafes?).my espresso was delightfully superb + the croissant was large enough for both of us to share. \u00a0table service was provided by the girl behind the counter without the additional fee that is typically charged in other european places. \u00a0pudding looks like the place that caters to the upper-middle class society of barcelona. \u00a0not a problem for me. \u00a0but if in the area, please do check out the decor. \u00a0you'll be thinking about the 'alice in wonderland' comparison as well. trust me.",
