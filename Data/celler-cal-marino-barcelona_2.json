    "Perfection! \u00a0Eduardo the owner has a thing going, and he humbly knows it. \u00a0He is one of those displaced Spaniards who was laid off as a result of \"la crisis\" and decided to reinvent himself by opening up a tapas bar. \u00a0The place welcomes you with a row of barrels of wine, the most popular - Jumilla. \u00a0Locals come with empty containers to fill and refill with one of the many choices. \u00a0But the place is lined with walls full of bottles for sale or consumption, and if you get Eduardo going or his trusty side kick on any wine - you are in for a treat. \u00a0Unlike the older catalanes, Eduardo and his staff are actually approachable and VERY appreciative of your business. \u00a0Affordable, with excellent Tapas, this is one of those small \"mom and pop\" local shops that is heartfelt enough to bring you back!!!!",
