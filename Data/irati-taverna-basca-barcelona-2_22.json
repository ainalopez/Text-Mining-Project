    "Food: Amazing!!!! Fried goat cheese!!! And some other stuff I don't remember. Sorry!! But everything was pleasing to the eye and delicious! A little on the pricier side for students, but felt it was well-priced.Ambiance: Clean, well-lit. Space to stand at the counter directly in front of the food, and at the counter on the wall. I saw there's also space in the back to sit-down. They served dishes there rather than pinchos. From what I saw as I wandered to the restroom, everything looked delicious, no plate had leftovers haha.Service: Stellar. My friend is a vegetarian and we spoke with one of the servers and she put in two special orders for my friend immediately. We thought that was super swell.I'm definitely coming back!!",
