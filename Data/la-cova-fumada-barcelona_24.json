    "I now have two Spanish grandmothers and two loud aunts and uncles. Apparently this is a sought after place and hard to get into. Yes, there are packed crowds, but there are older Spanish women running this place and they may decide not to open one day. It happens. Get used to it and try again later.Fortunately, my friends ordered for me. I could make some sense of the menu, but it was nice having their help. I went outside my food range again. I skipped the whole baby octopus, but cut into a whole calamari for the first time, and ate beef cheek. There was also good grilled bread and sausage. My favorite was the first dish, but what was it!?If you want to experience local culture, this is definitely a place to try.",
