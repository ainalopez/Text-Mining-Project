    "This two-star michelin restaurant definitely lived up to the hype. \u00a0Far superior to two michelin star restaurants in New York.The tables are spaced in a way that you feel your meal is fairly private. \u00a0The service was impeccable - a variety of servers were involved in attending to you and explained each dish very well in English. \u00a0We had the full tasting menu. The courses were about 16 - each very detailed using really interesting ingredients. \u00a0I would say the meal veered more towards Asia and South America than Spanish. \u00a0As I always, find in these types of meal, the first 7 or so courses were far superior to the final ones. \u00a0Where this restaurant really gets the edge is the presentation -they cook a portion of the meal at your table with a bit of a molecular gastronomy flair. \u00a0Really memorable meal.",
