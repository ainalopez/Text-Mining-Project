    "We enjoyed this gem off season. \u00a0A friend recommended it and we were so happy to try it on our visit. \u00a0Fresh seafood sprawled out, market style. \u00a0Ask what is freshest...we had the tuna, calamari & razor clams. \u00a0They cut it in front of you and send it to the kitchen to be cooked. \u00a0You can order soup or salad to accompany the seafood. \u00a0They have bread and a selection of sauces. \u00a0Order your beverage of choice and then have a seat. \u00a0Your number will be called a few times, as the times vary on the items to be cooked. \u00a0We found the order to be perfect, as we had time to enjoy each dish hot. \u00a0Simple yet great food! \u00a0If you are looking for seafood, we highly recommend finding this place.",
