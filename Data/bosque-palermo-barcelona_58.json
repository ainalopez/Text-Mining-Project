    "I came to Bosque Palermo based on a recommendation for good paella without all the fuss and away from all the tourists.I would agree with the last two parts of that statement. However, my nice waiter tricked me! I ordered what they called \"Paella\" in their English menu despite speaking primarily Spanish with him. *Sigh*That said, the other few dishes ordered were quite good especially the 5 euro foie gras appetizer! The salad, sangria and tomato bread were good too.Also, as is common in Spanish tradition, the locals probably won't come in until around 9pm for dinner.I'd go back BUT VERIFY that you're getting real paella...although what I got was actually pretty good.",
