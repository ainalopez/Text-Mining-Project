    "I got food poisoning! Someone in the reviews called this the Applebee's of tapas, and they were spot on! Like I mentioned, this place gave me food poisoning!! The food seemed like it came out of a microwaveable box, be cautious! My stomach was gone for a few days and dampened my Spain trip a bit :/ . And the sad thing was, the waiter recommended I get the breaded chicken, and it was awful!!!I'm giving two stars because prices are reasonable for menu of the day. This place is a tourist trap, indeed. Rule of thumb: if they have someone standing outside the restaurant trying to get people to come in, DO NOT GO. I do NOT recommend this place, seriously, go anywhere else, there are many better options everywhere.",
