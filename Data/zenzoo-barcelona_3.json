    "Of my short 4 nights stay in Barcelona - I came here 3 times. I would have made it a 4th - but decided to give a different place a try (sad i wasted my calories on that place - see other review). This Bubble Tea Shop is what other Bubble Tea shops in the area need to aspire to be. They have a good expansive, yet easy to order menu/system. They offer the drinks both hot and cold, as well as slushies and smoothies. The staff was friendly and accommodating, and the seating area (grassy/astroturf) was unique and inviting to relax and enjoy your drink. \u00a0There's also free wifi as well as a bathroom - which made this place a very convenient spot to kick back and relax after spending time in the Ramblas.",
