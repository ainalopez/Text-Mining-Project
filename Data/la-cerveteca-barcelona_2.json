    "Many years ago, when I was still strong and handsome, I was wondering in Barcelona free and easy when I suddenly discovered this gem. On those days it was a store specialized in beers. They have more that anyone in this city. But at that time I left Barcelona, and when I returned a year ago (not as strong and handsome as I was) the cerveteca was still here. And now is not only a shop, the place is more a bar or specialized beer. With some really good craft ones. They have 9 beers on tap and many more on a bottle in their fridges. The waiters know what it's been on tap, so you can let them make some suggestions based on your taste. The vibe is also pretty good, with locals mixed with tourists. And they also serve snack to ease the way down of your beer, always a mustIf you happen to be nearby, don't hesitate and give a chance to the cerveteca to quench your thirst. You are not going to be dissapointed.",
