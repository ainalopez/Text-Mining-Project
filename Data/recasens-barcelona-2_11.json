    "Meat, cheese, meat, cheese oh and more meat! We had a quick bite at Recasens. A good bottle of wine, very nice cheeses and meats. You should also try one of the salads and 'pans'..It's also dirt cheap as portions are really large and quality is high.. But maybe that's compared to the Netherlands only..Main issue I had is that you don't stop eating..",
