    "Great paella! Tons of seafood, saffron flavor, and well-cooked rice with some of the great burnt flavor at the bottom. Pricey compared to the other restaurants that advertise \"paella\" but you get what you pay for at the other places. Totally worth the experience. We went because it was featured in the NY times and the location could not have been better. Sit in the outdoor covered patio on a nice day and enjoy its beachside view. The house wine is cheap and delicious as well (I think it was 17 euros for a bottle of white wine)!",
