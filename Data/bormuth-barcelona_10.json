    "Our group was eager to hit up a poppin' tapas restaurant during our 24-hour Barcelona visit and Bormuth caught our eyes due to the great reviews and its proximity to our hotel. \u00a0Upon arrival, the restaurant was already packed but fate was on our side and we grabbed one of the last available tables. \u00a0Our server provided menus in English and spoke excellent English herself and after taking our order, our food arrived at our table within just a few minutes.Highlights:-White Anchovies: for you anchovy skeptics, these beautiful white filets are not nearly as salty and intense as the canned ones you find on pizzas. They're delicate with a nice seafood bite, I was a big fan.-Meatballs: rich, delicious sauce, and oh-so-meaty-Pimientos Padron peppers: love these little roasted pepper bites - so addicting and flavorful!Jamon de iberico: best ham in the world?! I mean c'mon, you can't go wrong with this item at any tapas joint.-Cava sangria: served in a HUGE glass and pretty dry - yum!The so-so:-Calamari: flavor was pretty standard; satisfying but not memorable-Bu\u00f1uelos de bacalao (Salt Cod Fritters) Bacalao: I've had these back in the US but \u00a0 these were intensely salty and was too much for this self-proclaimed salt addict. Perhaps the more salty then the more authentic it is...?-Mussels: the broth was WAY too salty, mussels seemed pretty fresh though-Patatas Bravas: soggy, not good at all, just noAll-in-all, it was a good tapas experience but nothing really blew us away. \u00a0We did appreciate the fast service, good prices, and cozy space. \u00a0If you need a tapas fix, hit up Bormuth!",
