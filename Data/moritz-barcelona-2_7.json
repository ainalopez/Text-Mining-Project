    "A fully Catalan beer brewer? Well i guess the history is the original owner came from Alsace, but it's totslly Catalan now. Cant speak to their food but the namesake beer is solid. Light and refreshing but with a slight earthy barnyard funk to it. For the longest time i only really knew Estrella for Spain based \u00a0beers, now i have a new go to when in Catalonia!",
