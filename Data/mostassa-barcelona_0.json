    "Mostassa is a neighborhood gem. Quaint, quiet and cute, while being very reasonably priced! You get the same vibe, healthy options and quality as Brunch and Cake or Flax and Kale, but at half the price! Their juices are yummy at 2.50\u20ac and come with a free optional chia seed boost. Their food is all under 10\u20ac and it's all light and delicious. I definitely recommend Mostassa if you're looking for a new healthy, inexpensive place to chill.",
