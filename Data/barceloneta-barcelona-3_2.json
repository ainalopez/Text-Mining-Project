    "Service: Horrendous. Our waiter was switched up at the beginning of our service. The manager came to take our order and he was just so standoffish. Didn't explain anything to us and kept his words very minimal. Not a very friendly atmosphere. Waiter barely came to refill our waters and didn't pour our wine, nor did he offer us to taste the wine before confirming if we liked it (I always thought these fancy places do that for you).Food: Definitely overpriced, but the oysters were pretty amazing. Fat, succulent, and very fresh. Paella was horrible. 21 euros for something that would feed maybe one person, depending on how hungry you were. Looked very lackluster with no color whatsoever. Had just 2 prawns and was just, meh. The octopus though, was delicious! Nice char but good meaty flavor. Have to say if you're going to order anything, order the octopus!Overall, would NOT recommend this place nor would I go here again. The view wasn't even that great. They placed us in a corner of the restaurant with a bad view when there were plenty of empty tables with a better view.",
