    "Yes yes, come here, wait in line. It'll go quicklier than you think it would. Just wait, and get the bikini and the ox tail and everything else that people get. Save up to eat here. It's petite portions with great taste. I'd say it's worth every penny. You do have to come here at least once, if you're only visiting barca just once in your life time or something.",
