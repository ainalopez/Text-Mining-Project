    "What a delightful little spot! \u00a0We were in the neighborhood and we're looking for a place to have lunch when we came upon Peu Claris 190. It was inviting and once inside, charming. The food was delicious - everything so fresh and tasty. The jamon iberico was very yummy and we were lucky enough to chat with the chef owner, who told us which market he shops at. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and would return there happily.",
