    "It is actually pretty good! We had a classic beef one and a Mexican one, and both were delicious. Two downsides: the place itself is not great to eat in (it was quite empty when we went, which was a bit awkward) and if you want to try several flavors, you cannot order the 2- or 3-bola portions (which are cheaper than 2x1 or 3x1).",
