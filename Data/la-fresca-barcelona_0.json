    "If you are wandering around the Barcolenta, get off the beaten path and try this neighborhood gem for delicious tapas at reasonable prices. The staff was friendly and welcoming and with enormous goblets of sangria to wash it all down we had the cous cous, black sausage, potato bombe, octopus, and coconut pudding (similar to flan). We didn't try the burger, but the man sitting at the table next to us ordered it and it looked huge and mouthwatering!",
