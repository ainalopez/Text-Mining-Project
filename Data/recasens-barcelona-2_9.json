    "I feel as though we stumbled onto a secret place with Recasens, so I - as per usual - grapple with sharing it. \u00a0But I'll be generous! \u00a0Here! \u00a0Go HERE!Recasens is a beautiful spot in the Poblenou District of Barcelona. \u00a0In December, arrangements of apples and winter squash and cabbage were put together as decoration, with tea lights interspersed. \u00a0So beautiful *tucks in mental filing cabinet for Thanksgiving decoration 2013*.Just beyond the tourist fray, Recasens, to hear it described by my Spanish friends, began as a deli, then expanded to a restaurant serving many of its goodies. \u00a0It is a delicious business model, with a menu centered around salads and big wooden boards of, to use North American trendy food speak, charcuterie. \u00a0Our table tried an orange salad with mint and pine nuts (lovely) and (even more delicious) a foie gras salad topped with fine shavings of the liver. \u00a0Not usually being a fan of foie, I was surprised by how regularly my fork returned to that plate: this salad was a perfect mixture of greens, and tart, and crunch, and fat, and sweet. \u00a0YUM DASH OH. \u00a0We couldn't have the board of meats and cheese (a selection of both Spanish favourites and others, with the stand-out being the white pork Catalan sausage) without some pan tomate. \u00a0Vine-ripened tomato rubbed on bread with some seasoning and olive oil? \u00a0It makes a great base for any and every kind of tapas, trust.With a bottle of wine, ample food for all, our bill came to 50 very affordable Euros for 4. \u00a0Affordable high-quality eats earns Recasens a 5 star two-forks-up rating from me. \u00a0Yelp note: seriously recommend making a reservation here. \u00a0It took me a good while to wrap my mind around the 9PM Spanish dinner time, and at Recasens there are two dinner seatings: 9PM and 11PM. \u00a0Keep this in mind - if opting for the earlier time-slot - you will likely need to limit your on-site schmoozing to 2 hours.",
