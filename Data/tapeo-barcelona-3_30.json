    "We went here yesterday and we loved it so much we came back again today. \u00a0This place has excellent food, we love this restaurant.Before I cover the food, I should mention a few things:1. \u00a0The bathrooms are fantastic. \u00a0They are super clean and air conditioned.2. \u00a0The wait staff speaks excellent english, and even entertained me when I tried my bad spanish, but the wait staff are awesome and really on top of things.We tried, over the course of two days:Octopus (special menu item) - delicious, if you like octopus. \u00a0The main worry was that it would end up chewy and difficult to eat, but they did it justice and it was very tasty and tender, not chewyMorroccan lamb skewer with mint yogurt - my wife loved this. \u00a0It tastes exactly as you would imagine it, very good.The bombeta - it is a fried ball of meat, mashed potatoes, spices, and has sauce for dipping and was fantastic. \u00a0Americans (like myself) will love this. \u00a0I could eat a whole meal entirely just of these. \u00a0This is the one that I will order every time I visit.Cod fritters - kind of like a lighter version of the bombeta (with fish instead of beef) and had fewer spices, so the fish didn't jump out as much, it was more subtle. \u00a0Truffled eggs and foie gras and mushrooms - Anything that has foie gras in there I am going to like, and that is the case here. \u00a0It tastes like how you expect.Rabbit - We were trying to be daring and we tried rabbit and it was one of our favorites on the 2nd day. \u00a0It tastes a lot like chicken but with a slightly beefy overtones. \u00a0I liked it with and without the dipping sauce, my wife loved the sauce, which was somewhat like mayonnaise consistency with some other flavor we couldn't identify (but was good).Ox Tail - They take the super tender meat from an ox tail and remove the bones. \u00a0It is clearly reminiscent of ox tail soup that I have had in asia, but without the bones of course. \u00a0On the one hand, I like having it on the bone, on the other, I can see that they are working to save you from making a mess.Iberian Pork Ribs with honey and mustard - Delicious! \u00a0Fall-off-the-bone tender and incredibly tasty. \u00a0I thought it was slightly sweet, but my wife thought it was perfect, and she doesn't like mustard at all. \u00a0Very yummy.Catalan cream dessert - The taste is fantastic, but you should know what you are getting. \u00a0It has the consistency of super light whipped gream that is heated on top like creme brulee. \u00a0It tastes great, but it's like tasting sweet air. \u00a0It was almost like cotton candy (except liquid instead of solid) in the way that it melted and disappeared from you tongue. \u00a0I loved the taste, it was a fun experience. \u00a0You may not want to order this as your only dessert though.Bread pudding - I loved this. \u00a0It was a warm bread with creamy custard center -- it was a perfect end to our meal.",
