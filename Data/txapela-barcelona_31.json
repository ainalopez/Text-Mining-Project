    "LOVE this spot. Very touristy, but if you're visting the city you will undoubtedly be walking up and down Passeig de Gracia.The pintxos are DELICIOUS. Some of the best in the city (I lived there for 3 years). The menu is also fun, as it's full of photos. The price is spot on as well, very yummy and inexpensive!",
