    "Located in a bit more quiet and residential area of Barcelona, this place feels clearly more geared towards the locals. It's very laid-back and the service is friendly. Set-up is a mix of Pintxos (that can be picked from the counter and then the toothpicks are counted at the end when you pay) and tapas (ordered at the table) but with clear Basque influences. The food is reasonably priced, good wines (not huge selection) at affordable prices and not the least the quality of the food is good.Either come early or ensure you have reservations as it is very popular. Almost all the dishes are good but the meat dishes are among the best so not really the place for vegetarians. It is not innovative but really solid and good food so I often end up visiting at least once every time I'm in Barcelona. Also a plus is that they don't close for siesta so open from either 11 or 12 (depending on the day) until midnight.",
