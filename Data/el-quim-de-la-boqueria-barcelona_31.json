    "5 star food served in a 1 star location. We received this recommended place from our cooking class instructor. (Side note: We took a 1 day cooking class in Barcelona) She recommended this place since they serve fresh seafood. The seating area is not great since everyone sits at a bar. Since it gets crowded, you have to wait and claim your seats before someone else does. English menus are available, so all you need to do is check off what you want to order. It was amazing to see 5 people in a confined space where a couple people cooked and others served drinks. This was one expensive lunch, but well worth it.Razor Clams (15 euros for 6 pieces) - I never knew what razor clams were until I saw them in the seafood section of the market. The razor clams were awesome! Simply simple with the preparation. Mixed Mushrooms with Egg and Foie Gras (22,95 euros) - My husband said that this was the best foie gras that he's had in Spain. The foie gras vendor was across the restaurant. Regardless, the mixed mushrooms were awesome! Fried Artichoke Chips (6,75 euros) - You have to get this appetizers! How can anyone resist deep fried artichoke hearts? Delicious! Our damage was 49 euros for lunch, but it was memorable!",
