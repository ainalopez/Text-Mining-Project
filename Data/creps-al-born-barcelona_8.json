    "Crepes and cocktails - how can you not like it here! This place is in the heart of the Uber Cool El Born area of Barcelona. \u00a0I first found this bar when I visited 5 years ago and returned last month when I went back. It is cool for day and night, drinks and food. As the name says they specialise in crepes and do both sweet and savoury. The array of options is huge and on this occasion I had salmon and cream cheese. It was epic! My other big recommendation is the White Russian cocktail which is lovely and is a favourite of mine. Food is served late in to the night, so no excuses not to try a wee crepe whilst you making your way through the cocktail list!Easily 4 stars,",
