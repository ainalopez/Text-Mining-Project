    "Similar to other yelp reviewers, my friend and I came to this pub to watch World Cup near our hotel, and weren't disappointed. The game was somewhat slow but the staff were very welcoming and the drinks were plentiful and cheap. We wound up staying late after the game had ended. We had a great time hanging out with the bartender and other patrons, watching a mix of 80s-90s music videos and turning it into a fun drinking game. Good times!",
