    "This place is absolutely sensational. I'm from Los Angeles, the land of vegetarian and vegan foods but Teresa Carles takes the trophy. We had the Black Rice, the lasagna, the Gezpacho and the apple crumble and each item was absolutely amazing. We ate here tonight and we can't wait to go back. The service staff is very helpful and the prices are more that reasonable. Absolutely loved this place. Now just need to figure out a way to bring it to LA!",
