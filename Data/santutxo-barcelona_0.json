    "Amazing restaurant with amazing service. Ate here twice while staying in Barcelona in February 2016. We are lunch here one afternoon ordering the set 3 course lunch menu. The fideua was one of the freshest seafood dishes I've ever had, and this includes everything I tried in Tokyo. The owner/chef and hear waiter/chef/bartender were both incredibly hard working and truly passionate about their food and great service. They spoke English well and made the small restaurant very inviting. \u00a0We were here in the cold month of February, so we were forced to eat inside, but there is a beautiful outside seating area behind the restaurant as well. The restaurant is conveniently located just a short walk away from La Sagrada Familia cathedral. Make a point to visit this restaurant while in Barcelona!",
