    "This place is great. I ordered the Mediterranean and the Goat Cheese slices. \u00a0The crust is excellent and the taste gourmet. The white wine by the glass was a great pairing. A little understaffed, but excellent and very experienced. So please be patient if they are busy. Good with English, too. I will definitely be ordering a full sized to go pizza.",
