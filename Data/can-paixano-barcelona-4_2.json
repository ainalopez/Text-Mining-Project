    "I truly didn't know what to expect when I walked in. I came here on a tip from a friend, and the only advice she gave was to \"be aggressive\" So on a crowded afternoon, I walked into this madhouse of a tapas bar, with patrons, food, and alcohol flying around everywhere. Luckily for me, a group of local students welcomed me into their group with open arms, and so began the culinary experience. You muscle your way up to the counter, grab a cook's attention, and shout out anything you want to eat or drink. Order plenty- everything's pretty cheap (tapas around \u20ac3, bottles around \u20ac6-7)I personally grabbed a bottle of the cava, and some Spanish fried sausages, lomo sandwich, smoked salmon sandwich, and croquettes. Basically a carb filled deep fried goodness of a lunch paired with ample amounts of alcohol. This is a great place to day drink with friends, or if you're up for it, meet some new people and share some stories over cheap alcohol.",
