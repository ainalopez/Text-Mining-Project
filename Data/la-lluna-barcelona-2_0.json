    "The gluten free menu was great and we indulged in a 3 course meal on a Sunday lunch. We booked for 1:30pm and it started off fairly quiet, but by the end of the meal the place was almost full. It was definitely worth it, so I'd recommend booking on-line.The service was good, though they seemed a little too busy to take our bill in the end.",
