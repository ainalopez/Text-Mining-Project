    "This place is really small and sweet with just 3 tables and a bar to sit at. I had a goats cheese veggie burger with an almond milk smoothie and they were both delicious and very helpful for my hangover. The menu had lots of options which surprised me, I don't expect so many choices at such a small place and the owner makes it all right there so you can see exactly what you're eating! Fresh food, nice flavours and it's cheap. I loved it and I'm going back!",
