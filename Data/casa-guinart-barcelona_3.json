    "I had the bravas and mini tapas size paella with some cava. On a Saturday, it was very busy, they are fully staffed and any more staff they would be stepping on each other. Very quick service considering how busy they are. Downstairs bar, watch the chef's, I presume more dining upstairs. I sat at the bar, it took them a good 5min to help me bit they are fast at bringing dishes out! Great food, busy atmosphere",
