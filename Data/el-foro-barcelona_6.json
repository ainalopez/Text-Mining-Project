    "A much appreciated restaurant for a sit down meal after lots of tapas bars. \u00a0Staff were very accommodating, the space was large but felt intimate, and the food was good, including a shared fondue and roasted vegetable salad and gnocchi. \u00a0Just on the edge of Bari Born, so you can head to a great neighborhood for bar hopping or sight seeing before or after eating.",
