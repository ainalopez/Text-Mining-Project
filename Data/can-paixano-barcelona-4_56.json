    "Can Paixano was everything I hoped it would be--simple, cheap food and barely enough room to breathe. Not proud to say I'm SO that person that will go anywhere that's bustling and has a line out the door since it's gotta be good...! However, this place didn't disappoint. Hubby and I shared a bottle of cava, two sandwiches (jamon/tomato and a foie, ham, pork), and a plate of fried sausages. For about 15 euros, we left feeling satisfied and maybe even a little bit tipsy. For the value and quality of the food, I think Can Paixano is a must when visiting Barcelona. If not for anything else, do it for the 3 euro cava bottles!",
