    "Wide variety of wine selections. Toasted tomatoe bread was delicious and crunchy. Highly recommend their seafood dishes such as the razor clams and prawn in garlic sauce (4 pieces each). The assorted sausages are a must. Comes with 6 pieces with 3 different types of sausages. Add some assorted vegetables as well, oxtail/potatoe was stewy, but just decent, (slightly salty). Over all had a great tapas experience and the service was great! Probably ordered about 9 tapas 3 desserts for 4 people with a bill that was roughly $130 euros",
