    "YUM!!! Made a visit here after getting a recommendation from a restaurant owner in Nice - and wow, are we glad we went! Didn't make reservations, so had to wait maybe 15-20 minutes, but with drinks in hand, that's not too bad! As a tapas (and lover of everything 'mini' food) I was so excited to try lots of things and literally everything we had was wonderful! Our favorites were the local mushrooms, the steak tartare, the --- oh, who am I kidding - we loved everything! The Brie, the sausage, the croquets, the spicy meatball, the mussels - literally everything we just went on and on about! Wine prices were actually really good and the bottle we had was wonderful! Didn't feel touristy at all, which we loved!Possibly my favorite meal on this trip to Europe - if you're in Barcelona - GO!",
