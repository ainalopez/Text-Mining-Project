    "Yes it is hard to find. It is at the very back of the market towards middle. There is construction there so it is hard to see but look for a slender door that I mistake for a long window. \u00a0Recommend the Grilled Monkfish, it was my first time eating this fish and it was yummy My husband says it's alot like lobster. The grilled chicked was good too. The steak was okay... try something else. For a group of 4 amd drinking only bottled water it came out to a little over 66 Euro. So I think this business should have 2$$, not one.",
