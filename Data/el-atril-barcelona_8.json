    "The good reviews here have been the main reason for us to stop at El Atril.And honestly, I can't confirm them. I have been to Barcelona for days this time and we had good food and good service at restaurants. Sometimes even both at the same restaurant. Non of it we had at El Atril.The athmosphere, the furniture is well choosen at the restaurant and it is located nicely at a square with chairs/ tables outside on two sides (street and square).The food was mediocre. I'd recommend to leave out the tapas. Not a fair value. You can have much better tapas at other bars. But we can give a recommendation for the main dish with the mussels. They are tasty and the portion is quite big.The service was lousy. Ok, we have been there \"late\" - but hey, we are in Spain. Dinner is not over at 8pm. And I expect at least a friendly waiter who acts annoyed the moment he/she realizes that tourists with limited spanish skills are sitting in front of him/her. Customer is king - but not at this location.We loced Barcelona and will come back very soon. But there are much better locations where you can have a good time and good food.",
