    "My husband and I stopped at La Pepita during our stay in Barcelona. It was a small, authentic tapas restaurant that was VERY crowded! Needless to say, it was a great sign that the place was packed. We went on a Monday evening and had to wait about 45 minutes (we grabbed a few drinks next door while waiting). The service was good, the wait staff was helping in telling us how many tapas or order and what may be to our liking! Overall the food was good and we enjoyed just about everything. My only complaint is that we felt slightly rushed as the restaurant is small and they were probably trying to seat as many people as possible.",
