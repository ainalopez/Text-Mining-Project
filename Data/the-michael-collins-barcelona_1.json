    "This place is pretty cool in terms of ambiance and seems to always draw a decent crowd; I guess it helps being right across from La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. There is a lot of historical pictures hanging about and the pub is deceptively spacious. Having been a few times, I have noticed at least most of the staff is actually Irish which is neat. :)A pint is pricey, in my opinion, at \u20ac5 and I haven't really bothered with other drinks at this point. I have tried the burger off the menu and it is good. Beware, the kitchen closes around 9 or 10 p.m. They occasionally have sporting events on the telly which draws an even bigger crowd and it can become quite warm and difficult to navigate through, but it's been a fun time!",
