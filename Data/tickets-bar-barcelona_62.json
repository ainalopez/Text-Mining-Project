    "Being Albert Adria's restaurant we had very high expectations and were not disappointed. \u00a0The whimsy of the restaurant's decor and the food made a great dining experience also a lot of fun.The mini airbags, the razor clams, the avocado cannaloni with crab sauce were just some of the fantastic dishes we had. \u00a0The presentation of the food and how to eat each dish made the meal even more fun. \u00a0The only disappointment was we weren't able to spend more time there as we had to get to a Barcelona soccer match.",
