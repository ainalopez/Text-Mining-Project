    "Food quality was subpar considering what's in the area- this place is just not very good. Wait staff was neglectful and not very friendly, also odd for the area. To top it off, the manager was directly rude to me while I waited for my husband to use the bathroom after we finished eating. He asked to seat me, and when I replied in broken spanish that I was waiting to for my husband to leave, he waved me away like a fly at a table. Only bad experience I've had in Barcelona.",
