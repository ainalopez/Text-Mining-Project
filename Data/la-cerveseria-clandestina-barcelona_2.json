    "I wanted to like this place a lot but I had a poor experience with my burger's temperature and had to send it back twice because it was literally raw. We started with some jamon which was pretty good, standard fare for Spanish food. The place itself was really busy so we had to sit at the bar, which made eating sort of difficult because there were tons of people around us watching the football game.I ordered the burger with gorgonzola and pesto and my sister ordered the cheddar burger, which looked divine. My burger was sadly so undercooked I was actually afraid to eat it and so I sent it back. I guess the bartender didn't understand why I was sending it back because he said it looked amazing but I'm not kidding when I say the burger was totally raw inside. After sending the burger back twice, I finally ate it and by then I was sort of disenchanted with the whole experience because my sister had already finished her burger and had to wait for me. The burger wasn't very big and there was hardly any cheese or pesto on it. It didn't look like any of the pictures of the same burger that were posted here. I probably wouldn't come back.",
