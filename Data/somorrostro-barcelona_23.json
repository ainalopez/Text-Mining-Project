    "All the people giving 5 stars clearly have their heads up their butts as it is the only explanation for their liking the food that is so akin to excrement. I am giving two stars b/c the service was speedy and very friendly.The food however was abysmal and overpriced. I think the chef is just trying too much. The seasonal tapas are overpriced and unnecessarily complicated. The chef needs to just do less and not ruin what seemed to be, for the most part, perfectly good ingredients. Our group ordered a large spread of tapas and I definitely recommend you stay away from the sweet and sour soup and the eel. Everything else was too salty or too spiced and just wasn't worth it.",
