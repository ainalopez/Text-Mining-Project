    "I'm trying to remain calm. I'm experiencing Spanish unhospitality at it's best. Walk into this restaurant because it had great ratings. They tell me to wait for 30 mins. That's ok. I go to the bar and try to sit. Bartender starts shouting at me in Catalan. I have no clue what the heck he is saying. Apparently I was not supposed to sit there even if there was an empty stool. The waiter figures out that something is up and she intervenes taking me to another stool. Then I wait and wait and wait. I'm asking about the table, I'm told to wait while they are siting people that arrived before me. One hour passes and then I go up to the host. I told him either u sit me or I go. He sights the sits me down. Then, get this, an old guy in the corner, probably the owner, starts making comments in a tongue I don't understand while old man is pointing at me. By now \u00a0i am starving, I'm tired and choose to ignore it",
