    "Thank you Yelp reviewers for leading me this delectable place!I started with the \"Virus Killer\" juice, which was very flavorful with a hint of sweet and hint of spice. I then had the Olla Aranesa soup, which was served out of a large clay pot. The soup was perfect comfort food, warm with winter veggies. Next was the Black Rice with mushrooms, artichokes and a soya aioli (\"all-i oli\"), which was hearty and tasty. I had to stop before finishing as I had my eye on dessert. Dessert of Coulant (molten chocolate cake with Madagascar ice cream) was totally worth it! I don't normally do dairy, but this was a worthwhile exception. Mmmmm!!Great service, cute ambiance!",
