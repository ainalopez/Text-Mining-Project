    "Fresh Seafood with prices you can't beat. \u00a0This is pretty much a seafood market that cooks for you and is self service, even busing your own table....BUT...considering that we had 750g of sushi grade Tuna for only $16 (which was grilled perfectly) ....I would have swept the floors (and had my wife clean the toilets) for them !! \u00a0Also had 1kg of steamed shrimp and Chicharrones. \u00a0Add bread, \u00a0salad, beer and a glass of wine and we were a family of four \u00a0stuffed for $60 !!",
