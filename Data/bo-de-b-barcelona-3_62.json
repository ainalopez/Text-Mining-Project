    "In Barcelona, there isn't much you can get for \u20ac3.50. Generally, you can expect a thin baguette with olive oil and some salami but at Bo de B, you get so much more! The sandwich is made with a baguette like bread that is big, crusty and soft inside. It is overflowing with all the veggies you want (olives, lettuce, tomatoes, lentils, corn, cucumber, onions, etc) and lots of meat that grilled on the spot for you. Delicious! I could eat here everyday. Wish I discovered this little gem sooner.",
