    "I came to Tosca with a friend while we were on vacation in Barcelona in September. \u00a0It is a small and lively place with a great ambience in the Gothic Quarter. \u00a0We really liked the quaint setup/decor of the restaurant, and the music in the background was a nice touch.We started off with a pitcher of red sangria. \u00a0Though the sangria was not as fruity and flavorful as I generally prefer, it was strong enough to feel good after a half pitcher (split with my friend) and fairly cheap. \u00a0For tapas, we ordered the baby squid, the chorizo, the rustic pizza, and the empanadas. \u00a0Though the baby squid was fried perfectly, it was a little bland. \u00a0The chorizo was also lacking a bit in spice, though it was hearty. \u00a0The rustic pizza (containing sweet potatoes, chorizo, feta) was delicious- though a seemingly random grouping, the combination of flavors was amazing, and all the ingredients managed to stand out. \u00a0My favorite, however, was the empanada dish (caramelized onion, goat cheese, mozzarella, walnuts). \u00a0Caramelized onion and goat cheese are a naturally great, rich pairing; combined with the crunch of the walnuts, the empanadas were heavenly.I would definitely come back here if I come back to Barcelona; it is a great tapas bar.",
