    "Perfect place to eat fresh seafood. Each time that I go to Barcelona I try to go here.Good value for money, around 20\u20ac pp, but with a large amount of food, and I find that it's a fear prize for seafood.Also a nice service.The only thing is that they don't accept reservations, so it's very possible that you have to queue (but it's quick). The only problem is waiting a summer day under the sun.",
