    "We stopped here for a late lunch after walking all morning and we were starving. The blackboard outside advertised a 3 course lunch with various options for 10.50Euro. Once seated inside we got handed English menus which didn't have the lunch offer on it. \u00a0Upon inquiring, no one was 'able to understand' so it seems the offer wasn't for tourists but locals (or tourists with fluent Spanish) only.We ordered a burger each and they were served quickly and was very very good. I'm not a burger person and I would have eaten anything at this stage but this was really nice.They offer free wifi but you need to ask for the password. Service was generally friendly but the lunch deal rip-off didn't sit well with me at all.",
