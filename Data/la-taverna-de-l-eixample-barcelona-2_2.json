    "This place has a lot of potential, the food is good and the location is great, however, the service is just horrendous. Beware of the guy behind the bar, we asked for a pitcher of water and the waitress had no problem with it but when she went to ask for it at the bar he refused and told her to sell us a 4\u20ac bottle of water which costs less than 1\u20ac at the store. Feel free to come here if you enjoying being shaking down for your money.",
