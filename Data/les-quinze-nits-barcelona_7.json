    "Decent prices and good options for when you are tired of tapas. Location is perfect for al fresco dining. Get there early (about 8pm) or else you will be standing in line waiting for a seat outdoors. We had the steak and lamb shoulder. Loved the lamb. Cooked well and falling off the bone. Steak was good, not necessarily a home run but good. We also had the veggie quiche which was tasty but the veggies in the actual quiche were minced so not really identifiable. There were fried veggie \"chips\" on top with mesculin greens. It also came with cheese ice cream which could have been omitted because it simply tasted like ice cream.",
