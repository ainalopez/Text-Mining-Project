    "Came here for brunch! Cozy little Bar and Bistro. The staff was very helpful & spoke very good English. They also have an english menu and it uncomplicated my life! It has a nice quiet hipster atmosphere and the food was reasonably priced.Husband and I tried the Triple Whammy Breakfast Burger which was DELICIOUS as well as a Ranchera Omelette that was AWESOME! That and an espresso , mimosa and a water. Our total bill came out to be 25euros including the tip. Considering coming here at night time as it turns into a nice cozy lounge.",
