    "this was one of our best finds in Barcelona...we I found it using the downloaded Lonely PLanet Barcelona app. It's awesome because it finds where I am with GPS, and tells me what restaurants are good with descriptions. Sometimes, they're misses because once it's on Lonely Planet, it gets overrun. But this place wasn't. We went there I think on our way to Parque Guell (another Gaudi work of art) and it was cheap (for Americans given the exchange) and delish. The pitcher of sangria came in a customized clay pitcher bearing the establishment's name. AND they had a yummy flan for dessert mmmmmm. It was also situated on a narrow street off the main road (alley-like) in a local neighborhood, meaning we were the only asians and only ones with cameras. Easy to miss the entrance to this place. The waiter didn't even speak English but a smile, some pointing, and my high school Spanish came in handy!",
