    "This place is significantly overpriced. We had tapas between three and pizza for one. A couple items were over 13Euro and one prawn dish with only 5 prawns was 23euro. Yes the prices were marked but the quantity very small for the price. Best avoid these dishes and stick to the cheaper items at 4 or 5 Euro. I wouldn't bother going here again and I imagine there are other more worthy places to try.",
