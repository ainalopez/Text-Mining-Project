    "Great restaurant tucked in an alley way in the Gothic Quarter.Came here on a Friday morning right before noon. The place was packed with a young crowd probably a mixture of both hip locals and tourists. They were able to seat us after a couple minutes. I really didn't mind the slight wait at all because for me \u00a0it's more fun to eat in vibrant and busy restaurants anyway.We ordered- huevos ranchero- 2 cavas- smoothie- a yogurt with honey and fruitFood was all delicious. Can't say I've had better huevos ranchero actually. This place beats a lot of brunch places even back in the states so I would say that it's legit and they've done their homework.Service was really great too. They were fast, nice, and super helpful.Total came out to be ~25 euros. Really solid in my book.",
