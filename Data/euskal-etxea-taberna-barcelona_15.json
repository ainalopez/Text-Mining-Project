    "This place was highly recommended by a couple friends, so my husband and I decided to give it a try. We were in the mood for tapas. Unfortunately, we got confused as to how the tapas (called pintxos) worked so we sat at a table. Tapas is only served at the counter. We felt committed so we just ordered dinners. I ordered duck and he ordered lamb. It took him 3 tries to order something due to confusing info from the waiter. Frustrated, my husband settled on the lamb. After seeing his frustration, they gave us a different waiter. Our second waiter was very attentive and helpful. I really enjoyed my duck (I had also ordered potatoes in garlic but that portion of my order got lost in the waiter switch). My husband enjoyed his lamb in spite of his earlier frustrations. Overall I give this restaurant 3 stars. If we go another time while we are here I will be sure to get the pintxos.",
