    "Just got back from Barcelona for work and met my boss and some coworkers at Bar Mut for dinner. \u00a0I had no idea what I was getting into. \u00a0I was treated, thus did not see the tab so this review is solely based on the experience and food. \u00a0First off, we were a party of 8, the only English speakers, and comprised roughly half of the entire establishment. \u00a0I was barraged with every tapas on the menu, numerous bottles of French and Spanish wines. \u00a0The whole experience was incredible and this was hands down one of the best meals I've had in my life. \u00a0Some of the highlights included Oxtail in marrow sauce, beef fillet with foie gras, shrimp in egg garlic sauce topped with micro shoestring potatoes. \u00a0The environment itself is very non-pretentious and quaint. \u00a0This was exactly what I had in my mind as a little Spanish tapas bar. \u00a0So if you are in Barcelona, make a reservation, and enjoy!",
