    "Back in the day - my dairy tolerant days, when I could have all the cheese and cream and butter to my heart's content - I LOVED coming here. \u00a0Those days are gone. \u00a0But I still fondly remember Da Greco - how they'd serve a chunk of parmesan cheese on the table for us to pick at... they'd finish off the risotto in the hollowed-out wheel of said parmesan - swirl it about, and then serve it cooked and seasoned to perfection. \u00a0Not only would they serve you a plate of it - they'd place a serving in the center of the table for everyone to try... and then serve a plate to the next table \"para probar\". What if no one at your table ordered the arrabiata pasta? \u00a0but the next table did? \u00a0That's right, you'd get a small serving \"para probar\". \u00a0The place looks like an antique shop exploded in the restaurant - with ornate candelabras, fancy framed oil paintings, and statues galore... kinda cluttered if you ask me.But the food was good. \u00a0I'd go there again, but it's torture, I tell ya! \u00a0Seeing those foods that I used to love that I can no longer have... like the mushroom ravioli... sigh.",
