    "Sister had dined here (twice) last summer and said it was not to be missed. I tend to agree. First, there wasn't a better pan con tomate to be had in all of Barcelona. The rich olive oil drizzled on top was luxurious. The patatas bravas featured a perfect aioli and slightly spicy smoked paprika. If you order the meatballs (bomba) know that these are not your Italian-American versions. The primary ingredient in these is potato. The service was stellar and it was a very nice looking restaurant. Would definitely return.",
