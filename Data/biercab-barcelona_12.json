    "Delish food and great service! Came here after a long day of exploring Barcelona and boy were our Tummys glad that we did. The burgers and potatoes bravos were spot on. My friend and I aren't huge beer fans. But, they did have a nice hard cider which can serve as an alternative to anyone in our same boat! Wish we had time to come here a second time. They were fast, friendly, and good quality food was served. Fantastic! Many thanks",
