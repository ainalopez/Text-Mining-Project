    "3/5 starsBarcelona is my favorite European city! Les Quinze is located in the heart of downtown, in a plaza. We were there 1 hr before the doors opened for dinner at 7:30pm (doors opened at 8:30pm--ppl eat late and party late!), and there were already 30+ ppl in line, and after 30 minutes, there were another 30+ ppl behind us!So ridiculous; I thought the food was good, but not great!The highlight were their paella and sangria, but otherwise, it was just OK and affordable.",
