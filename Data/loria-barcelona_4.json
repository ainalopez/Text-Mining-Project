    "Seriously the best experience we had in all of Spain. \u00a0Started as a stop to enjoy a glass of wine before dinner. We were enticed by the trendy yet understated decor. The bartender took great care of us and introduced us to their gin and tonic \"show\". We came back a second night for dinner and were even more impressed. NOEL the server/waiter/navigator was the ultimate host. Helped us pick an amazing wine from their \"gallery\" of wine on the wall. Food was one of the best we've had in all of Spain. Noel will take great care of you. Enjoy!!",
