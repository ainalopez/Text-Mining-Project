    "The roasted chicken was really moist and tasty! You walk in to a long open counter to eat or you can go upstairs to a seperate dining room. They are open late and the vibe kinda reminded me of the late night taquerias back home. Service was fast! Note: it's not in the best of neighborhoods so leave your luxury goods at home :)",
