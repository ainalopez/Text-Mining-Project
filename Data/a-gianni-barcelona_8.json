    "After eating our body weight in tapas for ten days, we opted to do a quick Yelp search near our hotel and made a beeline to A Gianni for a little change of culinary scenery.We split a delicious gnocchi with gorgonzola and a pizza with salami and brie. The gnocchi, which can easily fall prey to overcooking, was perfectly prepared and paired nicely with the mild, creamy blue cheese sauce. The pizza - with a chewy crust and a light hand with the tomato sauce - transported me to a summer I spent in Sardinia as a teenager. Authentic and tasty.The service was lovely and accommodating. We were a low-maintenance duo, but I saw the waiter patiently respond to a litany of questions about the menu and multiple inquiries for \"more marinara\" at a neighboring table. Bless him. When you're craving Italian in Barcelona, look no further than A Gianni.",
