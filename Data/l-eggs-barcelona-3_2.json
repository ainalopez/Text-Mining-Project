    "The food was just ok. We started the yolk croquettes, which were good but they were missing salt. On the flip side my main dish was the ham with eggs and Fries, which were too salty. However, none of this would have bothered me too much if the service had been good. Everything went great at first, but once we were done eating we sat waiting for a server to help us for 30 minutes. We tried to wave our girl over multiple times and she would always look away. In the end we had to go up to the bar and get the check. We were going to order dessert, but they never came to try to help us so we were tired of waiting. Overall ok food, but terrible service.",
