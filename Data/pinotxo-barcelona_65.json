    "Walking by Pinotxo in La Boqueria and just by luck, snagged a seat. \u00a0Since I don't eat pork, shellfish,snails, octopus, I thought it might be an eating challenge at this particular spot, but they made MANY suggestions of what they could make for me. \u00a0I wound up having what looked like a fresh mozzarella, grilled and placed on grilled bread (it actually tasted a little porky...) with a balsamic sauce....HEAVEN! \u00a0I would've ordered MANY more items, but there was no way I could consume any more food. \u00a0The oxtail stew looked delicious...",
