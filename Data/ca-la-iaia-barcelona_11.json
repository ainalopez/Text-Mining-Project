    "We used to frequent this little restaurant back in 2002. I was apart of a group of students from Texas A&M studying abroad. We lived 1 block up Escorial. The owner Josep was the most friendly and welcoming person. The meals were always made fresh. The portions were plentiful. Each meal consisted of at least 2 large course and several smaller courses. The house wine was included with the meal and our glasses were never empty. Best of all, this wonderful home cooked meal was not expensive at all. Then again, at the time the dollar against the Euro.Good times!!!",
