    "This is small, very friendly bar, run by the same family since the 1930's. The interior is covered with coloured tiles, a collection of bottles and bottle openers and other such homely items. They serve (as the name suggests) their own local cava, as well as beers, ciders and wines, and they provide a wide range of really good tapas. It's close to the Picasso museum, and is listed in most tourist guides, so it's hardly undiscovered. But for such a touristy area the service is both efficient and friendly, which makes a refreshing change from some of the others venues close by. Worth seeking out if you're in the area.",
