    "We arrived at around 9 and had to wait around 30 minutes for a 5-person table, but we were seated in a pretty timely manner in a nice table in the attic area. The waiter was super sweet and attentive (as long as you speak Spanish with him!). Pulpitas a la plancha (grilled octopus) was divine - tender, juicy, tenderly cooked. Everything else was a-OK: jamon iberico, calamari fritters, seafood risotto, and seafood paella. The risotta and paella bases were very well-done, but the dishes were overly salty and some of the seafood was not that fresh. Overall, a pretty good meal. Bill came out to around \u20ac70 after taxes for 5 for food + carafe of sangria.",
