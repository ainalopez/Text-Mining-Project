    "Excellent food but REVIEW YOUR CHECK FOR ACCURACY!!! This is some of the best authentic food you can get. We ate there twice and wanted to go back a third time. Both times we caught mistakes on the check - items they charged us for we did not order/eat. I ended up catching a big mistake back home in the US when i was reviewing my receipts. They charged us for a full plate of gambas ($17) when we only hand the 1/2 plate ($8.50). Unfortunately, I don't believe this was an honest mistake based on the other mistakes. In seeing other reviews, many people comment on how expensive this place is. I actually don't think it's that \u00a0- I think people are being mis or over charged. We loved Barcelona, but unfortunately there is a backlash against tourism there, especially gringos.",
