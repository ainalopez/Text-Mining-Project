    "The burgers are really great! The burger is massive and the patties seems to be homemade. The quality of the ingredients is good. You have to fill out a form what kind of burger you want, if you want fries or any extras on the burger and what you want to drink. You hand in this form, have to pay upfront and when your burger is ready the will call out your number. The place itself is really small, but we found a seat right away",
