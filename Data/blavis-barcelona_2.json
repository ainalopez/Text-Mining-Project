    "A perfect meal: fresh ingredients prepared in an original style. A fusion of Latin & Spanish flavors. Wonderful ambience, super friendly & helpful staff/owners. They let me order half portions so I could try more items, & explained what things were. I got There early so that I could get a table because other reviews mentioned the small number of seats. This let me talk with the owner who recommended certain dishes and describe the wines & was super helpful. Great place, great food, great ambience, great people. I totally recommend this. five out of five!",
