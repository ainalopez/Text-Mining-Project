    "heres a quickie : service sucks..everything is so slow.stoic servers. no smiles. do not get their seasonal salad....I'am pretty positive the backcook seriously went out to the yard and pulled some of the green's, forgot to wash and complied on the plate. theres no sauce. they charge you for bread. check out the receipt for a \"pa\" charge..interesting.the paella was okay, a bit salty. wasn't worth the wait . Pricey as well.. check out the ones on the rambles streets. probably worth your investment.",
