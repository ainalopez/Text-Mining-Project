    "This is random, but I was in want of a veggie restaurant in Barcelona and thankfully found this on Yelp (thanks guys!!).Overall, just SO thankful to finally get some veggies in my diet and some cleansing juices after a week of drinking, tapas, and jamons. \u00a0They were also open on Sunday. \u00a0Praise God. \u00a0Plus, they speak English here, the restaurant is super cute, and there's a pretty good variety. \u00a0I can't recall what I got, but they usually have daily specials which look good, and there are plenty of food that appears non-vegetarian but are vegetarian. \u00a0I don't know if that makes sense... Like veggie burgers, and etc.The minus 1-star is the fact that some of my leaves were wilted. \u00a0It didn't feel like the 'freshest' food I've had, as in typical vegan places in Cali. \u00a0I was kind of disappointed by that, but I've also experienced that with many places in Barcelona. \u00a0I kind of attribute it to the fact that food isn't as easily wasted in restaurants in some places in Spain vs. the US. \u00a0I don't know if that's a false assumption. \u00a0But regardless, still a great find.",
