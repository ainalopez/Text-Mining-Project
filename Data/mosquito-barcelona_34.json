    "Has a lot of good stuff goin for it. \u00a0As others have readily acknowledged, their international bottled beer list is great -- not only that, but being able to order a tall, frosty stein of good ol' German beer is a HUGE plus, as a decent draught is a rarity in Barcelona, especially if you're not a fan of watery pilsners like Estrella Damm.Although I usually find the \"here's a little pencil and a slip of paper, you do the rest\" menu approach sort of annoying, it works in this kinda place: it makes it just as easy to come in and indulge in a marathon dim sum-and-drinks dinner extravaganza as it is to sit at the bar and have a beer or two -- if you're in a rush, you could be in and out in less than half an hour. \u00a0The menu is simple, divided into \"dim sum,\" \"hot,\" \"cold,\" and \"dessert\" (in Catalan, but not too difficult to figure out). \u00a0All the small plates I tried were light and fresh -- certainly not run-of-the-mill Chinese fare, and a far cry from the weird vinegar-y shit that most Chinese joints in Barcelona offer up.My only complaint is that I would've loved some light tunes playing inside, but if you're sharing a meal with the right person/people that doesn't really matter -- and of course, I'll take Catalan bar chatter over American Top 40 or Gagnam Style any day.",
