    "Is 'third wave burgers' a thing? If it is, Bacoa is definitely one of its champions, along with Berlin's Burgermeister and Blend Burger in Paris. The cardboard burger holder is something new and with lots of potential; it collapses before the sauciest of burgers (like mine) but a fun thing to try if you don't want to get your hands dirty. I can't remember the name of my burger but the entire meal felt quite Catalan, what with the potatoes and the sauces and all.Btw there are a few locations strategically located around the city, so no excuse anymore for not going!",
