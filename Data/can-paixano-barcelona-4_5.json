    "This place was one of the highlights of my time in Barcelona.It is stressful, as mentioned in other reviews, since the place is SO crowded with locals and you don't want to impose on them. So I would recommend reading through the previous reviews to get an idea for what to order, so you don't walk in and look extremely lost and confused. I got the chorizo sandwich two times i visited (my absolute favorite meal in Barcelona), and the ham & brie/cheese sandwich once, and then the final time I got the mixed sausage plate. Their chorizo was absolutely incredible, and it's what kept me coming back every single day of my trip. For only 1.90 you get a delicious sandwich, but might need a second one after trying how good the chorizo is. The ham & brie sandwich was slightly more expensive but also incredible. The mixed sausage plate was great too, although I'm not the biggest fan of blood sausage, so I only ate the other two types included (one of which was this delicious chorizo I seem to be obsessed with).Prices are unbeatable, and you can takeaway to eat in a less frantic/congested place, but I would recommend at least once to eat in here and have the full experience. I went at11 AM Saturday - Completely packed, but no wait outside. Hard to get attention of servers.5 PM Saturday - Had to wait outside for 10 mins before entering. Absolutely packed.8 PM Monday - Compared to earlier visits, this time was nearly empty. Seemed to just be locals enjoying an early drink or late snack.",
