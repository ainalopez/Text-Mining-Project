    "Our recent trip to Spain was a first for me and my partner. We had issues acclimating to the culture, food, etc being meat and potato eaters. Combined with jet lag, I felt I may have to starve for the entire week. Fortunately, we decided to explore the restaurants within our hotel, the W. And we found Salt. Yes I know it's burgers and fries. But it wasn't just the food and drinks that earned the 5 star review. It was the staff. From Anna the hostess, to our waiter and bartender whose names escape me, the staff were amazing. They all approached the table at one point or another to make sure we were taken care of. And finally, the ambiance of sitting at the Mediterranean just cannot be beat. Salt was one of our best eatery experiences between Madrid and Barcelona. I highly recommend it.",
