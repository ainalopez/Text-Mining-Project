    "I honestly love restaurants like this - these family owned gems tucked away in a very unassuming location. Ca l'Isidre is not flashy or trendy, it's elegant, traditional and entirely itself. Upon sitting down at the table, the owner Isidre will tease your senses with some of the most beautiful truffles I have ever seen. I highly recommend you buy into it if you are a fan of truffles - it is worth it.The wine list is to die for. From a fine array of local Spanish wines to truly unique vintage wines from countries all over. \u00a0Whoever curated such a beautiful masterpiece should win an award. Enough said.The menu was also beautiful. Traditional Catalan dishes, blended with more approachable entrees - all very well cooked and the ingredients all tasted so fresh. I don't know that you can go wrong with any of their dishes. Through all of my research on this restaurant, I was told the \"chocolate souffle\" was a MUST. \u00a0Woody Allen's favourite chocolate in Barcelona. I'm so glad I 'gave in to peer pressure' because Isidre's souffle is phenomenal. It was almost heartbreaking how good this souffle was because I knew I would soon have to leave Barcelona and Ca l'Isidre's.",
