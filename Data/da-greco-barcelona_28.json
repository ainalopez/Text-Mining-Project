    "We were recommended to this \"secret\" restaurant by a few of our friends who recently visited Barcelona. We heard nothing but spectacular things. Maybe it was our high expectations, or possibly an off night, but I would not be running back to this place. I did not find the staff to be welcoming or helpful with the menu, nor were we even told about the specials or tasting menu. I had discovered the tasting menu on my own, and I wish I hadn't. My husband preferred to go off the regular menu where the food was great, and they bought out another plate for sharing. The waitress immediately didn't share what was on the tasting menu and simply stated it was a \"surprise\". I eat just about everything so that was not my concern. I felt the pastas to be slightly bland and the Dorado fish tasted overly fishy to me. My husband had a pasta with seafood which was very good and I regret not ordering something of my preference off the menu. Overall the decor was very fancy and the meal was just okay.",
