    "What??? This place only has 3 stars?? OMG.My husband and I had dinner here on our honeymoon. We had the 10-course chef's tasting menu with \"wines that harmonize.\" I don't remember the name of all the dishes but I remember they were so unique and fun to eat!When we were seated they gave us bread that was not memorable. I don't remember it but I have a pic. One of the 4 appetizers was a little pork sandwich that was amazingly good. Then they served a caramelized \"apple\" that had foie gras mousse inside. There was no apple, it just looked like one. The next course was Ensaladilla rusa and it had a lot of good stuff. Then there was cod's macaroni leek soup - there was no macaroni, it was just shaped like a macaroni.After 7 courses, we finally had the first of three main dishes - sea bass with yogurt, gentian, asparagus, and lemon peel. The second main dish was Pigeon Royal (yes, pigeon) with leek soup. I was really full and drunk by then. They were generous with the wine with each course... but we weren't not done eating and drinking yet!For dessert #1 we had something with cheese and honey in a cute little glass container. For dessert #2 we had strawberries with balsamic sorbet. Dessert #3 was chocolate and some kind of bitter orange. We thought we were done after dessert #3 but when they served tea, they gave us more chocolate. And more.... and more.. and more.OH man oh man what an extraordinary meal! It was more memorable to me than the beautiful buildings of Barcelona.",
