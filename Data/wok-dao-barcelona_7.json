    "If you travel to or live in Barcelona, this is the Asian restaurant to try. \u00a0The selection is unimaginably diverse, with multitudes of shell fish, traditional Asian stir fried dishes, and more accompaniments then you can fit on a plate; it is a Buffet. \u00a0Flavors of many different cuisine are offered, and if you cannot find something on the buffet there is a hibachi grill with plenty of fresh vegetables and proteins to create your own dish. Also Ice Cream, Fruit, Dessert is offered. \u00a0The Peking Duck is on point. Remember no tap water, drinks are per item; bottle of water, soda by can, they do have wine by glass.Service could be friendlier, but it is very efficient. \u00a0Lunch price is a great deal, slightly less selection than dinner I would imagine. \u00a0High Quality hand wipes. Like any Eatery, always check for Quality of Ingredients and Sanitation when dining",
