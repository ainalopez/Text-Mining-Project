    "W-O-W. After a long and hot day at the beach, I was ready for some shade and grub. I was trying to stick to a budget, which was no problem at Bo de B. There was a long line out the door, which was slow-moving but a good testimony to this place. I ordered a chicken sandwich with \"everything,\" which included corn, peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, and a few different sauces. The wait was a bit because they were baking fresh bread and cooking fresh chicken (fine by me!), and when all was said and done, I paid less than 5 euro for my HUGE sandwich. It was delicious, hot, and very messy, but I enjoyed every last bite. There were maybe 3 tables inside, but this is more of a grab-n-go kind of place.",
