    "Cal Pep is an extremely popular (with tourists) tapas restaurant. I wouldn't consider this restaurant the best place for tapas and was a little disappointed that they didn't offer a menu. They pre-selected dishes for you based on their needs. Although the cava flowed nicely, I didn't feel that these tapas dishes were exceptional. The ambience was noisy and the seating was tight around the bar. The only dish to highlight was the razor clams. They were tasty! Enjoy Barcelona.",
