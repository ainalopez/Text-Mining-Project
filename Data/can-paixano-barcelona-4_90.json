    "We're on holiday in Barcelona. It's a chilly, blustery, rainy day; I drag L down here, with a fair amount of swearing at maps, on the basis of something in a Time Out guidebook.It's a bit intimidating. A dark, narrow room with a food counter along one side and a deli counter in the back. No tables or chairs; walls lined with empty cava bottles; approximately a hundred people standing elbow to elbow, waiting for ham sandwiches. We shuffled in and tried, unsuccessfully, to look Catalan. I peered at the drinks list on the wall. \"Let's have a glass of cava,\" I said. I ordered what I thought was a four-euro glass and it turned out to be a four-euro bottle. We huddled in a corner and drank some. It was delicious. Fortified, we sharpened our elbows and our Catalan and ordered some ham rolls. They were also delicious. A warm glow descended as we neared the bottom of the bottle. The guy on break from the docks finished his own bottle solo, hitched up his overalls and went back for his shift, not noticeably the worse for wear. The family next to us got another couple, and some anchovies, and maybe another nice bit of jamon. \u00a0We started to feel like we fit in. Everyone likes cava and ham rolls, right? We're all one big happy, slightly drunk, family. I could do this every day. (It's probably a good thing I can't, however.)We window-shopped the hell out of the deli, and eventually staggered out. It was just before 1pm. Right over the road was the aquarium. We went and looked at penguins. It was a great day.",
