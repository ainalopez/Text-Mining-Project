    "This was hands down my favorite place to eat in Barcelona. \u00a0If you like calamari, get the baby squid and eggs dish, a house specialty. So Good!!! \u00a0Be prepared to wait in line for a seat at this little restaurant within the La Boqueria (another highlight of my Barcelona Trip). \u00a0The friendly staff will offer you a glass of cava and why not? \u00a0Most likely you will be on vacation...:-) \u00a0 I was traveling with my husband for a conference and I was on my own that day. \u00a0I would go back to Barcelona just so he could experience this fabulous place. \u00a0What a unique experience and so much fun to sit at the counter by myself and sip on cava while enjoying the squid with eggs and potatoes bravas. \u00a0So good! \u00a0 Go and give yourself time to wait. You won't be disappointed. \u00a0Leave time to walk through the stalls at La Boqueria - a great way to get a sense of the flavors of Barcelona.",
