    "My wife and I made it to Bastaix on two occasions during our one month stay in Barcelona... \u00a0Both times, we had an incredible experience! \u00a0Any time you enter a restaurant and they have their fresh produce proudly on display at the entrance with an open concept kitchen, you know you're in for a good time.The first, we visited with another friend who was in town. \u00a0For a muy \"tranquilo\" experience, over about 3 hrs we chatted, ordered botellas de vino, platos de carne, queso, huevos, olivas, pimientos, etc. (all the Spanish staples) all while the staff did a great job of keeping service up while not interrupting our fun.The second visit, \u00a0my wife and I returned for a post-diner jamon and vino. \u00a0I don't know what D.O. de Jamon Iberico they use, but it is some of the darkest, strongest flavored jamon we've encountered in Spain... \u00a0Absolutely delicious. \u00a0In addition, when you order bread, they provide a fresh tomato and clove are garlic for you to rub it on as you wish. \u00a0Add some great olive oil and its the perfect accompaniment to anything you order.They have a cellar dining room that I believe can be reserved (they have a glass floor at the entrance where you can look down).",
