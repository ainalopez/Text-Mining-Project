    "I attended Mobile World Congress and stumbled upon this place. I liked what the exterior looked like so I checked online and sure enough the reviews warranted a try.From the moment we opened the door there was a great aroma of food. We proceeded downstairs and 3 of us enjoyed a great tapas meal.Some things about Barcelona: It is very hard to find a good restaurant open before 8PM. We arrived around 7PM and this place was open. It was empty when we arrived and standing room only when we left.Another thing - it is sometimes hard to find English speaking waiters. At this restaurant everyone was perfectly fluent and even so fluent they could joke with us in English. This made us feel very relaxed.The prices were very reasonable. For 3 people we shared 2 bottles of wine, tons of tapas and some dessert. The whole bill was around 100 euros. Clearly a fair deal.Highly recommended. I will return again next year during MWC.",
