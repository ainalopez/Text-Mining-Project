    "I had reeeaallly good food here. i mean, the sundried tomato paste with anchovies was amazing. And the papas with alioli were the best i had in Barcelona. Honestly, i was expecting more from the potatoes in Barcelona but i didnt have any that were that great, only here. The salmon and fig i wasnt too crazy about but i could see why others would like it, thats just my taste. However, the service was horrible :/ For one person dining a few tapas (which should have only taken a total of 30 minutes) i was there for over an hour...always waiting for something (menu, placing my order, the check, and change). Otherwise i would have given this place 5 stars.",
