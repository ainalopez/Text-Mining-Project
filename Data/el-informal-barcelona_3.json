    "Absolutely beautiful, homey, and DELICIOUS. The appetizers consisting of Mediterranean and Spanish flare were stunning. The service in petite Le Cruset crocks were the things of a hostess' dreams. For main courses, I would have to reccomend the stellar risotto- stay away from the gnocchi. While the dumplings were dressed in a delicious truffled cream, the gnocchi themselves were made from waxy potatoes which are not the traditional choice due to the gluey and rubbery nature of the spud when kneeded. The flavors were there, the texture was wrong. The risotto was impeccable. Perfect bite and texture. What a great night!",
