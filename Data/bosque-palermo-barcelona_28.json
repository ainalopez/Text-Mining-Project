    "We got food poisoned after eating here two nights ago!! My husband and I ate there two nights ago. We arrived at around 8:15pm and there were a few tables already -- all tourists like us. We came for the seafood paella but decided to order a house salad too because we wanted something clean after three days of rich food in Barcelona. The salad didn't look fresh at all, it didn't have any dressing on it. Just iceberg lettuce with some chopped red onions, carrots, and olives. We ate it nevertheless because we really wanted some veggies. The seafood paella was not bad, we ate it all. BUT WE BOTH GOT FOOD POISONED THE NEXT DAY. I VOMITED TWO TIMES AND HAD DIARRHEA THREE TIMES. MY HUSBAND WENT TO THE BATHROOM A FEW TIMES BUT HE COULDN'T THROW UP, SO THE VIRUS PROBABLY STAYED INSIDE HIS BODY AND HE HAD A FEVER LATER ON AND STAY IN BED ALL DAY ON THE LAST DAY OF OUR TRIP. IT'S BEEN 24 HOURS AND HE IS STILL FEELING MISERABLE IN BED WHILE I WRITE THIS REVIEW. We think it was the salad but who knows, could be the seafood in the paella. Montjouic was our plan the last day but now we didn't get to go. We are leaving today. Yes paella at this place was not bad, but that was the only paella we ate here so we had nothing to compare to. And nothing is worth getting food poisoned in a foreign country.",
