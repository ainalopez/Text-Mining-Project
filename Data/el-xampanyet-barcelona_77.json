    "Simply incredible tapas, and a nice house cava! Anything you order for tapas plates will be wonderful....but you simply MUST try the small red peppers stuffed with goat cheese and drizzled with olive oil. I would say they are divinely delicious...but the words don't even do them justice. Yum!!! A must-try while in Barcelona...and don't forget a bottle of the house Cava while you are there!!!",
