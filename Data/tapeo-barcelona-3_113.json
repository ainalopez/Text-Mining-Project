    "Food: The Moroccan Lamb skewer was unbelievably tender and was my favorite dish of the night. The pork ribs with honey are the house specialty and were delicious. The Fried Egg with Wild Mushrooms and truffle oil on \"patata bravas\" were very nice as was the stuffed Squid with Sanfaina (Catalunya-style eggplant ratatouille), the Beef Cheek. The Padron Peppers were just as good as I've had elsewhere and everything was made-to-order and was fantastic! For those that drink, they have a stocked bar. The waitstaff were friendly and spoke English to those of us who don't speak Catalan or Spanish.The restaurant does get quite busy so I suggest going there when it opens after 7pm (we got there at 7:45p for an early dinner at it filled up shortly after). Most people, however, don't usually eat until 9 or 10pm.",
