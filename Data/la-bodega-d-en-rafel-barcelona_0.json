    "As my family and I have been vacationing in Barcelona, we have been on the lookout for authentic Catalan cuisine- a place that is a local's favorite, a place not like the typical overpriced, overrated, and mediocre restaurant that many tourists often stumble upon. And this is the place that we have been looking for.When we walked into the restaurant, the people eating told us, \"This is authentic Catalan food. You'll love it.\" The ambiance of the place is great! The restaurant was full of locals enjoying drinks and other people's company. When we were seated at the restaurant, our servers were really friendly. Even though it was hard to communicate with them with our limited Spanish, they tried their best to help us out with the menu after we asked them many questions about the food. We got the callos, croquetas, pork cheek, pork tenderloin, and ham. Everything we ate was really good and flavorful. My favorites in particular were the pork cheek, pork tenderloin, and the ham. The bread was really good there too and they kept it coming. For dessert, we had their almond tart and their chocolate tart. We enjoyed both, but the almond tart was our favorite. Both desserts weren't too sweet and a good portion for sharing. Our bill came out to be around 45 euros (we also got drinks) for 5 people. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area! The servers were really friendly and the food was great. This was definitely my best meal in Spain so far!",
