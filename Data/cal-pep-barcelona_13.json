    "My wife and I were down to our last evening and meal on our trip to Barcelona. After a long slog through various review sites, including this one, we settled on Cal Pep. I was glad we did.If you happen to have a group of four or more, you'll be directed to the dining room where there may be a different experience to be had; however, if your group is fewer, you'll join the queue for a wait for seats at the front bar. The wait it is well worth it; the experience, delightful.Once your spot is secured, you'll be met with a quick interview by some of the friendliest wait staff we encountered in all of Barcelona. They'll ask you about any food allergies and whether you are comfortable with 4-5 servings of tapas at the chef's and wait staff's discretion.Once you've cleared that, sit back and enjoy! We certainly did as we were served patatas bravas, pan amb tomaquet (tomato bread), fried artichoke hearts, tuna tartar, some sort of potato quiche-type dish, and finally a roasted sea bream which, while delicious, was a bit over done. All the while, the wait staff will happily keep your glass topped up with whatever it is you desire to drink.",
