    "Stopped in on my travels as I headed toward the coastal area of Barcelona. Rebelot definitely has some rustic charm that fits given it is so close to the beach. The staff was very friendly and they had an amazing old school hip hop soundtrack on when I came. Apparently they only use locally sourced ingredients. The whole place had a cool beach vibe to it.Sangria - One of the better glasses of Sangria I had on my trip to BarcelonaFired Potatoes - Big thick cut potatoes lightly fried and salted handsomely. Pretty much like thick cut friesChicken Club - It's a chicken club, nothing too fancy but it was fresh and tastyRoast Duck Special - I am a fan of duck and enjoyed the dish. It was mild sweet taste too it and wasn't fatty.",
