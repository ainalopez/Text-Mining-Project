    "I still day dream about the house cava. The best cava we had during our 3 weeks in Spain. The tapas is also really quite perfect. It's all delicious \u00a0but the seafood options are especially tasty withthe cava. My only reserve is just how crowded this place gets, but you really can't blame them for being so amazing. I'd happily wait for a spot at the bar. Can't wait to go back someday.",
