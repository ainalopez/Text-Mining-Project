    "I had my own experience and to be honest I didn't like it a bit. I visit the restaurants with a friend and we experience the so called famous dish of Olla de Sichuan. Some of the ingredients were almost frozen and the soups had a very strange looking taste (both of them). Honestly speaking I don't understand the previous ratings people gave to this restaurant. I personally don't see nothing special to call the the best one in town. Perhaps we were unlucky I don't know, but one thing I'm sure I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. The service is poor, prices are not low, the ingredients were not the fresh. Overall it was a very bad experience.Note: some of the restaurant pictures look very professional and can lead to you to have a wrong perception of the final dish.",
