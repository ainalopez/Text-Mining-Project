    "Bar Mut was one of the best places we ate in Spain. All of the tapas were excellently made - clearly thought through and delicious! Our favorite dishes were the foie which was amazing and an egg carpaccio that was beautifully crafted. My only issue with Bar Mut was the service. Our waiter was not very patient with our limited Spanish but I noticed another waiter nearby who seemed to be working very patiently with his customers so we would sometimes ask him questions.",
