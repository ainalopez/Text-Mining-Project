    "How can I judge Cal Pep. It's my first time in Barcelona and what do I know of Catalan style seafood. I heard of Cal Pep being the food junkie (a term I prefer to foodie, as I've admitted that those of us as obessed with food are total junkies) but I didn't even know it specialized in seafood and I literally was walking down the street, entered a plaza and there it was. I went for lunch at around 1pm. It wasn't busy at all and I got a seat right away. Parties of two had to wait about 10 minutes. Want to avoid the dinner rush, come at lunch.The server quickly realized I had no clue and almost no Spanish and there is no menu. I knew I wanted anchovies and I knew I wanted garbanzo beans and he suggested fried seafood. In hindsight I could have skipped the anchoivies but I am so glad I got the garbanzo beans served with spinanch and beautiful crisp bits of blood sausage (i have always had a weakness for blood sausage but never had it cooked like lardons). \u00a0The fried seafood was just the way it should be, crisp not greasy, you can taste all the flavours and the prawn were tiny and crisp meant to be eaten heads and all and they were!The service was quick but not pushy and it was far cheaper than I thought it would be. My entire meal was 21 euro and would have been less if I was sharing with another person.",
