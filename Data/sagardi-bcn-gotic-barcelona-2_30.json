    "We found this place as we walked through the Barri Gotic In Barcelona. We were hungry and on a budget. The place was packed. Good sign. We walked in, looked around and tried to figure out the system. There were counters all along the bar with rows and rows of pinxtos. You take a plate and walk yourself down the counter, choosing your pinxtos. You stand either at the bar or at one of the round tables. There is outdoor seating, but that comes with an extra price tag. We stood at the bar and had the best time. It was loud and busy. Awesome environment. There is also a selection of wines. I had the cava. Nice and cheap. \u00a0I had three pinxtos, which turned out to be enough. They are big and loaded with whichever ingredient you've chosen. We went back the next night and enjoyed it as well. Don't expect to be catered to. It's basically self service. And it's really difficult to get waiters' attention. When you're done, you're charged by the number of toothpicks left on your plate. If your on a budget and don't mind the noise, this is a good choice.",
