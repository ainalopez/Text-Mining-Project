    "First off, the food was to die for! We had the croquettes, zucchini in a flower, salmon potato tartar style dish, skirt steak, cannelloni and Catalan cream for dessert. Especially loved the croquettes and zucchini! We found seats at the bar and got to business. Ordering was fun and Carlos, the man taking care of us, was helpful, attentive, correct and friendly. My boyfriend and I speak Spanish but I can see how this would be an excellent place to go if you only speak English. In no way would you miss out on the authentic and wonderful tapas experience!Will certainly return when I find myself in Barcelona again. \u00a1Gracias, Tapeo!",
