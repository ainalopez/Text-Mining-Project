    "One of the just amazing meals I've ever had. Marcos is amazing. He knows everything about wine and is so kind. Each dish was perfectly balanced. All the food is organic, farm to table and locally sourced, some from their own garden. My favorite dishes were the gazpacho (toasted almonds, honey and sea salt) and the seared salmon with honey, dill and yogurt. Incredible.",
