    "Ambiance, well what can I say, European I guess. It is located in what seems to be a residential area with an open space part of which is turned to a al fresco dining area. Actually, my black fideo with fish was not too bad except for the fish being too dry. What irked me was the 2.5 euro each aubergine chips which was the size of button mushroom. Imagine paying 7.5 euros for 3 stir fried mushroom. My wife had a paella like dish that she did not finish and did not rave about. Staff were pleasant and quite attentive. Overall, ok but not worth the price they charge.",
