    "\u20ac6.95 for 3 empanadas and a wine. Not a bad deal, and flavors were really goodApple and cheese was tasty. Would definitely do the chicken one again. Vegetarian was tasty, but the pepper sauce they offer made it better. Good amount of seating, and some spaces to sit alone. Vibe inside is fine, nothing wild. It's on a quieter street, and I passed a lot of other restaurants on the way to it, but I'm glad I stopped by.",
