    "Amazing!The best burger in town. Great taste, soft bread, and delicious meat. Really good price and the team was very friendly. Burgos is one of the best burgers also the classic, plus is a very good price. As a tip I will recommend you the white bread 'cuz they charge if you change the bread. Rustics fries \u00a0are really good too, but to be honest only with burger you will be full.Enjoy your meal!",
