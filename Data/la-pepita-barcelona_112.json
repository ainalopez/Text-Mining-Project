    "La Pepita is just down the street from my AirBnB so after all of the great reviews on Tripadvisor and Yelp I had to try it tonight. It wasn't for me. I am travelling by myself so I sat at the bar which worked because at 9pm the place was packed and there was a waiting list.Overall the place had great ambiance and the dishes had some creativity, but the value was not there for me.I ordered a Gvine floraison (11 euro gin & tonic) which was fine. I also ordered two tapas; beef pepita with mashed potatoes (8.5 euro) and Aubergine fritters with goat cheese, honey and apple (8.85 euro). The tapas were interesting and above average but I am not clamoring to get back there tomorrow night and order them.For a total of 28 euros ($35 USD) I was not blown away and I was still hungry.Pet peeves: 1. According to the bartender the wifi didn't work. I would like to know if it's working a week from now.2. Service. The bartender was friendly enough, but locals come first and that is clear. Also, he needs help. The bar customers are a lot to handle with not just drinks but food as well.3. Maybe it is a european thing, but I am guest at your restaurant so maybe after the food and drink have arrived you check to make sure I'm please with things.If you are looking for the ambiance of a real neighborhood Barcelona tapas taverna and want food slightly more interesting then basic, and don't mind over-spending then you'll be good. That said, it is not for me.",
