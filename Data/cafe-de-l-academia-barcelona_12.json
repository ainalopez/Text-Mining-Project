    "We arrived here at 9:30pm this past Tues. night and were told there would be a 30 minute wait. We ended up waiting about an hour. But it was worth it. \u00a0The atmosphere is wonderful. It's a tiny place, but it's very romantic and warm. I really wish restaurants in the US would provide olives as well as bread, like Spain. I'm a gluten-allergic foodie and this was such a wonderful treat.  \u00a0For our dishes, we shared a large portion of the duck liver pate' on toast. I ordered the duck leg confit, which was huge and delicious. My hubby ordered the mini burgers, they were good but not amazing.  \u00a0 Unfortunately, our dessert was not what we were expecting because of words being lost in translation. But it was still good.  \u00a0 At the end of the night a cute little dog came into the restaurant and sat next to the kitchen door waiting, eagerly. While we were on our way out, we noticed that they were ushering her around the tables to clean up the floor. It was a pretty cute & smart way of cleaning up.",
