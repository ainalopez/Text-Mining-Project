    "We went to Flauta and had a horrible experience- based on one thing- The Gambas in garlic sauce was spoiled and had a strong taste of ammonia. \u00a0My husband and I both experienced this and when we told the waiter he said there was nothing wrong with it. \u00a0He basically made it seem like it was our fault when we told him. And we were very polite and nice about it. \u00a0We asked him if he had tried it, he said yes, and there was nothing wrong with it- it was quite upsetting to hear that a restaurant of that caliber would not admit to bad food and blame us for it. \u00a0Anyway- I ended up being sick for 24 hours throwing up with horrible cramps and shaking my last day in barcelona. Too bad. \u00a0I would probably not recommend that place anymore because of their arrogant staff.",
