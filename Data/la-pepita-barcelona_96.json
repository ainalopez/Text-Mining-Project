    "Our guide Marcel from Hi this is Barcelona took us here for lunch and it was FABULOUS!!!! \u00a0The smoked eggplant fritters with goat cheese - my husband hates eggplant AND goat cheese and he thought they were one of the best things he ever tasted. \u00a0He said the fried calamari was the best he ever had. \u00a0I loved the anchovies and roasted red peppers especially. \u00a0Everything was absolutely delicious. \u00a0Friendly service.",
