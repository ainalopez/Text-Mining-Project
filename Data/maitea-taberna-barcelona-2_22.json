    "It's about time I finish reviewing the best tapas bar I visited on my summer trip to Spain. \u00a0Yes, it's been a while, but I clearly remember how delicious the tapas were and how satisfied I was when I left. \u00a0The bar is pretty big. \u00a0If you get there early enough, you can grab one of the tables in the front or back of the restaurant. \u00a0If you're into the cold tapas, you can grab them right from the cases at the bar. \u00a0If you're in the mood for hot tapas, you can order them from a manu early on in the evening, or later at night they are passed around by servers. \u00a0The tapas are very inexpensive. \u00a0I believe they were \u20ac1.60 each. \u00a0I couldn't believe how cheap and delicious our meal was. \u00a0Definitely an amazing value!The menu is very extensive with lots of tempting options. \u00a0Here's what we tried:-frankfurter with bacon -meat croquette-white sausage with onions and garlic mayo-sausage with tartar sauce-cod with garlic mayo-baked potato with three cheesesAll the tapas we tried were excellent! \u00a0Everything was fresh and very flavorful. \u00a0If you're looking for an authentic and tasty meal, I would highly recommend coming here. \u00a0It's outside of the major touristy areas, but it's easy to get to and totally worth it!!If you're anything like my family and can't get used to the late dining hours of the local Spaniards, no worries! \u00a0Go early and you will be rewarded with an empty restaurant and easy access to all the tapas you want. :)",
