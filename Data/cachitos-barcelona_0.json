    "We were staying by the Sagrada Familia and loved having breakfast at this cozy little nook. The woman cooking probably has owned the place for decades as you could see pictures of a younger version of her on the walls in the same spot making food. Delicious food that filled us up for our day and a wonderful drink and juice selection. So happy we went here!",
