    "Excellent presentation and takes on tapas plates. \u00a0Every dish we had was very well thought out from a culinary perspective, and the ingredients worked together very nicely -- not just as an amalgamation of flavors but as a good presentation of a concept. \u00a0Service was also excellent; we started with my broken Spanish, but after a few sentences, the server graciously transitioned to English and was able to hold a rather detailed conversation about the wine list in English. \u00a0Speaking of the wines, they specialize in organic micro-producers. \u00a0I was a bit skeptical at first, but the waitress led me to a wonderful syrah from Jamilla.",
