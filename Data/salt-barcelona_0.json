    "Good place for an exotic burger and views of the ocean. Attached to the W hotel, it gives you a nice break from the pool scene of smoking bothers you. Bothered us big time so we went in search for nutrition elsewhere and until angels found this place. The server Julian was warm, friendly and helpful with recommendations. Recommended if you're looking for a simple burger bar.",
