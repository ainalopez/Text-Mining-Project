    "The eggs benedict here is the best I've ever had anywhere! And that is a bold statement because eggs benedict is my favorite breakfast food. They use a thick, Texas style toast rather than English muffin. The Hollandaise is creamy and flavorful. Eggs cooked perfectly. Crispy yet tender potatoes. Huge portions. I ordered my breakfast with some cava. Yum! It was SO nice to have a big, American style breakfast while in Europe. After 3 months in Spain I was definitely craving a breakfast that reminded me of home and Milk hit the spot. Can't wait to try some other dishes here. Highly recommend.",
