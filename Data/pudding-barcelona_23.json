    "A really nice whimsical place. Been here a few times and finally decided to do a review after the great customer service we had. My friends coffee was not up to par and the guy behind the counter remade or without hesitation. Our apple pie was great and tasted like home. Everything down to the cups will put a smile on your face. All is welcomed even the furry little friends. Did not give 5 stars due to the uncleanliness of the bathrooms. When I say unclean I mean extremely unclean toilet seats!",
