    "There is good news and bad news. \u00a0We had the red Navarra wine which was delicious. \u00a0However we must have visited La Palma on a bad night for their restaurant. \u00a0Two of the dishes that we ordered were not available. \u00a0We then ordered the cheese and fig platter which ended up coming with walnuts instead of fig. \u00a0I will say that the cod dish was quite good. \u00a0Perhaps it would have been better to order the tapas because they are more likely to stock sufficient supply but by the time we figured that out we were ready to go somewhere else for tapas.",
