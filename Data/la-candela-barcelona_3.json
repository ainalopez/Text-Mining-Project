    "Several times I tried to give it a second chance.., but unfortunately Candela shows the absolute absence of service. \u00a0You can wait 30 min for the menu, \u00a0that another 30 to have you glass of wine... No way. \u00a0Especially in summer. Although the food is ok, \u00a0I would prefer other places, \u00a0where waiters treat me well.",
