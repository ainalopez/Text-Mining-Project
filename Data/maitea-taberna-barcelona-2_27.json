    "I really liked Maitea. \u00a0(this is a rare thing for me to say about restaurants here in Barcelona)It's a place for Pintxos - or a piece of bread topped with something, pierced (pinched!) with a toothpick. \u00a0Typical food from the Basque country.I have been meaning to return because you can only try *so many* at one sitting. \u00a0There's standing room, and seats at the bar in front, and a couple of dining areas in back. \u00a0You help yourself to the cold pintxos at the bar, and servers come around with the warm pintxos - kinda like when you go for dim sum... and then some. \u00a0There's also a menu - not sure if it rotates with the seasons, as I've only been there once. \u00a0Whatever the duck entree was, we loved it. \u00a0and if there is more than one duck entree on the menu, my apologies for not remembering what it was to specify.The staff was friendly. \u00a0I went on a Saturday afternoon - after the lunch rush... so i don't know how crowded it gets during peak hours, but from what i heard, it can get packed.Prices are quite reasonable - they add up the toothpicks - i think it's about 1.60E each?don't quote me on that...",
