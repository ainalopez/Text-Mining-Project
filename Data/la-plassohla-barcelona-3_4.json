    "I really liked the food here! A very creative take on delicious tapas. One thing that is a bummer, service. BUT (and I know this shouldn't be an excuse) you just can't find great service anywhere in Barcelona. I mean, there are a tiny few, but for the most part, if you go out to eat you're going to be sitting and waiting for a while. That's just the culture. Being from NYC, we're used to people rushing us in & out as fast as possible. And we kind of like that. \u00a0As for Ohla, the ambiance is very nice. Prices aren't awful, but the portions are fairly small. I mean, they are tapas, but pretty small ones. \u00a0The good things: The place is beautiful. The food is tasty and very creative. \u00a0The not-so-good things: Service. Very small portions. Pricey.",
