    "I've been here a few times now, so I think a review is in order.Cafe con leche - 1.4 euros - StandardCarrot cake - 3.5ish euros - Good. I don't think they make it here, so it doesn't reflect too much on the cafe it self. That's my opinion.The ambiance is what gets me. It's quiet usually, and can get a little bit more busy at certain times. It's dimly lit with chill music in the background. There aren't many outlets, but there is free WiFi. It's the perfect place to come and get away from the bustle of the city and get some work done.The first time I went, I didn't order anything, I had left my wallet back at home and I was meeting a friend there so she ordered something. The second time, I felt a little unwelcome. However, the third time, was more pleasant. The lady (different from the second time) smiled and offered me a menu. Then after a bit, she shyly came up to me and asked if I wanted a menu in English. I said I could understand and thanked her. I thought that was really sweet of her.All in all, I'll definitely be coming back until my time in Barcelona is up.",
