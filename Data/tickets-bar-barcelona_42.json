    "Adria & Iglesias brothers make a total hit with tickets. Congratulations for an innovative and fun restaurant. Albert hospitality was great, thank you very much for talking and showing to me your restaurants. I want to note I went by myself since I lost my plane and came 2 days after my reservation. \u00a0I was very lucky to got an space for me in one of the bar areas. I let my server order for me. I had a blast since my first dish \"Pan Tomaca\" wish is the perfect combination of a crispy toast, tomato, garlic & olive oil. Then, I got the famous \"olives\" which were unbelievable, such an intense flavor in one bite. The rest of my tapas were: Boqueron, Manchego mini-airbags, Tempura de Algas (which only Adria's are able to make), Ugly tomato with withe gazpacho gelatin, avocado cannelloni with lump crab meat, oysters with its own pearl, truffles and pork cheeks sandwich. My favorite was \"Ventrezca de At\u00fan\" tuna belly in escabeche sauce. Yuuuummmyyy. I finished with a roses petals ice cream & green tea rock. Fantastic, I can't wait to go back and try 41*, Pakta, Bodega 1800 and Hoja Santa. I want to thanks all the team for making that night so special to me.",
