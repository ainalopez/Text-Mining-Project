    "I came to Chulapio on my first night in Barcelona and I couldn't have happened upon a better choice. I was walking around the area of where I was staying, saw it was in a quiet moment and happened on in. Bartender Supreme Luis kindly greeted me and helped me pick a menu.The two specialities at Chulapio are cocktails and cr\u00eapes, and both are excellent. I tried a Black Mojito, dry gin martini and a special cocktail that Luis whipped up for me, and all were sublime. The favourite pick of the the cr\u00eapes was a jam\u00f3n, rocket, ch\u00e8vre and honey, and tasted heavenly. Luis and co were very friendly, and helped me find some things to do on my trip to Barcelona. Gr\u00e0cies Luis and Chulapio for a fantastic and memorable night! \u00a0I'll be back on my next visit to Barcelona!",
