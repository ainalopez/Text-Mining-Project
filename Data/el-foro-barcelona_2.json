    "The food is OK (not great, just OK). And the place is nice but... I will never go there again. Because of the tricks...You will have to pay for everything! Yep, this is normal if you order it... But they will give you some bread with olive oil... during the time when you wait for your order. It seems like this is a kind of compliment (because they are slow... and they are!) but it is not a compliment... You will have to pay for this at the end and the price is per person.These tricks are so stupid...",
