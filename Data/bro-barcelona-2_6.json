    "Came here after passing by and saw that they had grilled meat sandwiches. Hubby ordered the steak sandwich which had caramelized onions, sun dried tomatoes, arugula and some sort of maybe based spread/sauce. It was delicious. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Steak was grilled perfectly and everything melded together well. I ordered the grilled pork sandwich, Bondiola, which had an arugula pesto and onions sandwiched between their artisanal bread. It was bangin! I even want to go back for another visit just so I can taste the rest of their sandwiches and burgers, even though Barcelona has so much more to offer. THATS HOW GOOD IT IS. \u00a0We went here on a whim, when I usually check yelp first. So glad I didn't or else I would have missed on a great meal. Each sandwich cost less than \u20ac7. They are big on tripadvisor. Don't let the one other review deter you. tripadvisor.com/Restaura\u2026",
