    "This is one of the best sushi places I've ever been to. My friends and I came here the other day and let me tell you, more incredibly authentic you could not get. If you're looking for real sushi, come here. Delicious, and the people are nice even though a lot of Catalan, Spanish or English, they do not speak. Definitely come here.",
