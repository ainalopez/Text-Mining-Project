    "Awesome place, good vibes, sweet people.During my Europe hop, I'd challenged myself to go to recommended restaurants and not look at yelp reviews, instead opting to order from the menu or from the waitress. The server at the front was exceptionally patient in walking me through the menu, and eventually constructed a three-course meal including a empanada, pasta, and a dessert.Everything was served promptly hot and fresh. I chose to sit right next to the pasta bar where the local chefs were hard at work preparing everything behind glass dividers. I saw them prepare the dough and filling for my ravioli- cool experience!Food was great, service was great, and I wouldn't hesitate to come back again.",
