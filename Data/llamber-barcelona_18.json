    "This was one of our favorite meals for our trip. It's upscale and different tapas then you see normally. We made a reservation so when we arrived we didn't need to wait, which was good since almost all tables were occupied on a Monday night. We had 4 people so we chose a few tapas and a few main dishes and we were satisfied and full at the end of the meal. We really enjoyed their black rice, anchovies, cuddle fish and veal. Our waiter recommended some great wines for us to try and we were all happy I'd recommend it to our friends and go again when we visit next.",
