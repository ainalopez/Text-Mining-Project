    "I'd read some fantastic things about this place. \u00a0Unfortunately, the service was so bad that I almost couldn't wait to finish and leave. \u00a0The girl who served me seemed to be going out of her way to be unfriendly - not just with me, but with all the tables I saw her serve. \u00a0Whenever she engaged with her colleagues she was laughing and happy and would then approach a table, unsmiling and surly. Food was just plopped on the table, no eye contact, interaction or invitation to enjoy the meal. \u00a0The food itself was pretty unadventurous. \u00a0I had the set menu with a rather pedestrian salad to start and then a main course of lentils, lightly curried, with some potatoes. \u00a0It was good, but hardly earth-shattering. \u00a0 However, bad service will always take the edge off a good meal for me. I imagine that the set menu is less elaborate than the evening menu, and I would happily return to try some other dishes, were it not for receiving the worst service I have encountered all year.",
