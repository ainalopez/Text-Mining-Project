    "There's so much to love about this restaurant - the food, ambience, decor, service. I would say the menu accommodates an array of preferences and dietary restrictions. My party has a range of dietary restrictions, but we were all very happy with what we ordered. I've tried the veggie panang red curry (ordered on two different occasions) and the salmon sashimi toast. The red curry, although not authentic, was exceptional. It was very flavorful and the medley of veggies were perfect together. The salmon sashimi toast was mediocre. The salmon wasn't fresh which I guess I should've expected. If you stop by for breakfast, get the vegan pear and chocolate muffin. So moist and delicious! It's a regular-sized muffin, so order something in addition to it since it probably won't fill you up.As for juices, I've tried the Green Medicine, Antiox, and Coco Masala Chai. My favorite out of the three was the Green Medicine. The other two were also good, but they were a bit heavier/thicker. I prefer light and refreshing juices.The staff is very friendly and helpful. One of them taught us some Spanish and another gave us suggestions on what to do while in Barcelona!",
