    "Really enjoyed the two meals I have had here. \u00a0First time I had the fish with tomato and mushrooms which is simple, fresh and fabulous. \u00a0Second time had the cod and also the eggs with morcilla and mushrooms (split both with the fellow diner) and perfect. \u00a0Best bread too and complimentary. \u00a0Good option because has a range of cuisines if you or your partner is over spanish food (how could that be??)",
