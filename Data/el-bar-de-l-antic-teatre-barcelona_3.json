    "There is 0 chance that you will come across with this place while passing by unless a very good thoughtful \u00a0friend takes you there. And guess what? I was lucky enough to have that good friend and he, as a good friend, took me to L'Antic Theatre on my very first day in the city. There is little entrance to the bar. You first walk up the stairs, once you are there, the first thing you generally say come about: \u00a0'Oh so beautiful', 'Very cool' or 'How do you know this place' etc. And I bet it is also everyone's first time that they associate a place totally shabby place with nice compliments :) L'Antic Teatre is recycled place with an amazing amazing inner terrace/courtyard inbetween the trees and several apartment \u00a0buildings. This ambiance is so one of its kind that it can not be copied by other people nor the owners can open a new branch with the similar concept. Because there is no concept!! Like Roman ruins anywhere in the world which naturally reached a certain form and ended up being authentic. Moving on from the location, there is also a physical theatre in the same place where it plays host to music, dance, performance art, exhibitions, conferences, festivals, cinema series. For this reason, I always felt like the cultural artistic scene of Barcelona is tucked in here. You should definitely stop by and maybe even meet some really talented and creative people here.",
