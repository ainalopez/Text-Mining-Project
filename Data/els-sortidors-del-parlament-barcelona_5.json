    "El Sortidors is an anchor of cool, hip, up-and-coming Parlament Street. \u00a0It attracts a slightly older, more up-scale clientele than some of its neighbors, but that doesn't mean you can't have a fun, relaxed time.I love the decor in Els Sortidors: spacious rooms, high cielings, and summer ferns add a Mediterranean air of clean, comfortable class to the establishment. \u00a0Wine barrels dotting the back serve as tables around which groups of yuppies and other, less pretentious professionals enjoy a glass of wine after work or before dinner. \u00a0The restaurant has an excellent wine selection and delicious, if slightly pricey, food. \u00a0The service is charming, attentive, and pleasant.Els Sortidors is definitely a must on any trip down Parlament!",
