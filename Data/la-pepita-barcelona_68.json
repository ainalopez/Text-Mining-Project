    "The tapas were wonderful. We had to wait a really long time to get in.. more than an hour but that was mainly because there was a giant bachelor party going on. It is a \"young\" place and the food is a bit more expensive than the neighborhood but it is worth it. Everything we ate was delicious. If you are \u00a0a large person, navigating to the back of the restaurant is challenging. It was crowded and there were people eating on the right side a bar on the left side, so I had to ask people to move in order to make my way to the back but once in the back it was lovely. The staff is also wonderful and sweet. but that was my experience all throughout Barcelona. Everything we ate was fabulous so I can't even recommend one dish! Its really a lovely place to go.The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because of the wait and the challenge of getting to the back.",
