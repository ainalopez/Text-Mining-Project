    "I can only reiterate what so many people have said about this outstanding little place. The food is delicious. The portions are huge. Tapas prices with American portions. I thought my five euro pork loin was going be small and I would need to order more plates but it was two generous filets and I had to give one to my fianc\u00e9 because I had so much food. The seafood is spectacular and I would highly recommend the mixed grilled fish plate. It's not only fish but mussels, squid, salmon, whitefish, baby squid and langoustines. You cannot beat these prices in a tourist town. We went several times during our vacation this month because we never found a restaurant that compared in quality or value. The house wine is very cheap and tasty. Service varies from awesome to good depending on who serves your table- but we had a language barrier to compete with. The paella was great and full of high quality seafood. I had a pork loin stuffed with cheese and ham, it was amazing. Their pepper sauce is delicious as well. You cannot go wrong with this restaurant!!",
