    "Cozy and fun resturant with deliscious food! Everything great except for the service!! Our waitress was so incrediply rude and talked with a very arrogant attitude! The check was 59,10\u20ac in total (tips included) but we were both charged 30\u20ac because she litterally snapped at me and said it would be impossible, when I asked her to split our bill in half. We were chocked as it is a very common service, but didn't bother arguing. During our time there she also shouted at some guests for accidentally blocking her way to the kitchen. A shame!!",
