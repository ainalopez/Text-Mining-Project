    "Went there for a late brunch on our holiday in Barcelona, chose this place because it was nearby and we were positively surprised. Had an outdoor seating in the sun, the service was kind and quick. The food is organic, homecooked and the portion sizes are reasonable. Had the scrambled eggs with iberian ham and mushrooms with a berry smoothie.UPDATE: had to go there again and it was as good as the first time. Good service, good food, cosy place and the best hot chocolate I've tasted for years and my hubby was crazy about his coffee. This time I ordered the eggs benedict - full of flavour, very tasty.",
