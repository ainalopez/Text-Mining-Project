    "This restaurant is fantastic and hits the trifecta of food, service, drinks, decor, ambiance, location, and more (alright that's more than three, a testament to how great it is). First, they were able to comfortably accommodate my horrible family of seven, no small feat in a not-so-big restaurant (cozy, not cramped). Second, we went there for the paella but then did not see it on the menu. Because my family is a bunch of horrible spiteful vultures, everyone glowered at me since I selected the restaurant. But of course, Cera 23 came to the rescue by making it for us anyway - and let me tell you - best paella on earth. Much better than Estelle Costanza's.Everything else was also fantastic - the lamb, the pulpo (octopus), the entire menu is delicious. I will return here one day.",
