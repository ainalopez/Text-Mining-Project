    "AMAZING!! During our 10 day trip, we went to parts of France, Italy, and then ended in Barcelona..... This was hands down one of the best meals we had the whole trip!! First, the service was outstanding! The girl working the front counter was so helpful and beyond friendly! She spoke great English which was extremely helpful. Second, the pasta was better than any dish I had in Italy! Raviolis were ridiculous and the empanadas are a must have! I wish so bad I had a place like this back home! Third, the price is cheap! Your meal comes with an app, main course, drink, and dessert, for around $10 euro per person! \u00a0Hands down a must go if you're in Barcelona! You won't be disappointed!",
