    "I am visiting Barcelona and my hotel was right down the street so I decided to stop band try this place out and I'm so glad I did! I got a starter and meal with glass of wine/beer for 14'90. For starter I got the tomato and mozzarella salad with was the biggest portion I have gotten since arriving in Barcelona and was delicious. My friend got the pate plate which was also a massive portion and amazing (had to take away). For main meal I got the pork loin stuffed with ham and cheese with a side of pasta which was great as well. My friend got the cheese plate (had to take away) which was yum! Came with a blackberry currant and paired with the cheeses excellently. Overall I would 100% come back and would recommend to any and everyone.",
