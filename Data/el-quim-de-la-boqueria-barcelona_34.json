    "Our first meal in Barcelona, bleary eyed from the plane, we stumbled onto two stools at El Quim, located inside Mercat de la Boqueria. This tapas place is bustling with people The white anchovies in vinegar are a must. Tortilla espanola with veggies, my first taste of jamon iberico - made from acorn fed pigs - and a serving of wild mushrooms completed our tapas experience. Simple preparation and each dish complemented the other. Perfect start to a food-centric trip to Barcelona.",
