    "The highlight of my trip to Barcelona! THIS is what you call Spanish tapas. I've been to several different tapas bars/restaurants and Quimet y Quimet was a whole different caliber of quality and taste. Every other place (Cerveceria Catalana, La Plata, Ciudad Condal, La Flauta) all fell short in comparison.Firstly, this place is small - tucked away in the alleyways of Poble Sec. It seats 10 at most at the bar and there are 2 or 3 tables. You are surrounded by wines and top-notch whiskey. I had the good fortune of dining next to a $600 bottle of aged McCallan. The show is run by two people - one woman and one guy and they make these tapas like clockwork. Most of these other tapa places all have premade dishes but not here, everything is made on demand and you can see it being made for your viewing pleasure!From the honey, truffle oil and caviar, everything is one-of-a-kind. A truly unforgettable dining experience.I would return to Barcelona just to dine once more at this place!",
