    "Very large restaurant, authentic-looking inside. Seems to get a mix of tourist and local crowd. Lots of wood in the tables and chairs, bar, etc, inside. Large menu. They have lots of outdoor seating, as all the restaurants along Rambla Catalunya do. The menu prices looked a little steep to me - dishes that would have been EUR8 elsewhere seemed to be listed for EUR12 here. But we stopped in just before they started serving lunch because we only wanted a beer and sandwich to hold us over. And those they did very well and for a good price, same as you'd find anywhere else downtown.",
