    "Stopped here for a late lunch after touring the MACBA. I ordered a spinach salad with blue cheese, apples, pine nuts, and bacon. It was delicious! My parents ordered the tomato and cheese salad as well as the veal sirloin. They were pretty satisfied. The service was good. I only gave this three stars because it was not anything special but still satisfying.",
