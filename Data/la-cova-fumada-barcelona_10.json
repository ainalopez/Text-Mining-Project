    "We tried just about everything and they were all excellent. \u00a0Starting with the fried potato ball, which he asked if we like spicy. Of course I said yes and although I wasn't disappointed, it certainly was very spicy. \u00a0From there it was on to the muscles in a soup broth. Also very good and as a hand I suggest putting the crust from the tomato bread into the broth for a few seconds to soak it all up. \u00a0After this was the grilled squid. This was by far the best thing we had. So tender, juicy and full of flavor. \u00a0From there the garbanzo beans came out, which were added together with a type of mashed up blood sausage I believe. \u00a0The last two dishes were shrimp and octopus. Yet again they did not disappoint.The service was outstanding even though they were insanely busy while we were there. We stood at the bar the whole time and everyone there was running around busy but still had time to take our orders and questions. \u00a0I really hope that I have the chance to go back again to try a few more things on the menu which I missed. Especially the artichoke which looks amazing, but they were out of it.",
