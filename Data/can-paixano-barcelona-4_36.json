    "Holy tapas.Thank you, Yelp, for helping me discover this amazing establishment. \u00a0Everything I tried here was great, but the highlights were the chicken croquettas, the ham sandwich, and cava rosado! \u00a0This place has it all: great food, great wine, friendly staff, great atmosphere, and surprisingly low prices for the quality!Warning: This place gets really loud and crowded, so I recommend going on a weekday and the earlier the better!",
