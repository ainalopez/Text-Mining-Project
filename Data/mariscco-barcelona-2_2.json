    "We went here and the service from the staff was wonderful! They have an area up at the front where they have the fresh seafood that gets cooked up. We had the lobster paella, which was very good! The paella fed 3 adults. I also ordered a grilled lobster by itself. The flan and arroz con leche are really good!",
