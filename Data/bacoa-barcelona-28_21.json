    "Came here for lunch on a Sunday when everything else (except tourist traps) were closed. We got the Japonesa and the the Catalan, with a side of patatas bravas. The Japonesa was glazed with teriyaki sauce and the Catalan was topped with fried shredded potatoes and bits of bacon.The burgers are very big, but not too thick unlike their American counterpart. They are easy to hold and not messy to eat. The buns (get the classic white) had poppyseeds and were soft, fluffy, and almost cloud-like. The patties were medium cooked and just as big as the buns themselves. The patties were not too thick, but if you are a big carnivore, there is the option to get a double patty.The most amusing thing about the whole experience was the condiments. There were kiosko-branded bottles of ketchup (very different from Heinz), bravas sauce and spicy bravas sauce. On its own, the burger is a little bland, so these sauces are great to add a bit of a kicker.",
