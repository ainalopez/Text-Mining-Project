    "A friend recommended that we try this place for their tapas. It's pretty much a buffet of tapas and you can sit down and go back for more if you want. They charge per plate which isn't too bad. Their items were delicious and very bold with flavor. Some were sweet and savory and some were warm or served cold. I really loved the different ones they have with brie or savory and sweet combo tapas. It was always crowded and we sometimes had to wait for a table. But all in all it wasn't so bad. Some people stopped in for a snack and others stayed for a full meal.",
