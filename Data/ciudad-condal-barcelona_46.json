    "One of our fav meals we had in Barcelona and reasonably priced. \u00a01) fried camembert covered in nuts with raspberry sauce (2.75 euro) \u00a0- my fav! \u00a0Could eat these all day2) beef filet on toast (3.8 euro) - filet cooked perfectly 3) grilled anchovies - they were prepared well but anchovies are simply better cured than grilled 4) burrata with tomato salad (daily special, 5.10 euro). \u00a0Very good! \u00a0Could use some salt5) jamon, lettuce and mayo on toast - meh, don't recommend this one.6) monkfish and prawn grilled skewer - delicious!! Their grilled prawn was perfection.7) flan - good but nothing exceptional, most flan tastes the same",
