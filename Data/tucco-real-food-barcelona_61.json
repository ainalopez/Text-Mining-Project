    "My Pasta was so flipping good I damn near left my partner to be alone with it. The ravioli were delightful pillows of joy no doubt handed down by the pasta gods themselves.The Parmesan was so addictive I had to go home via the rehab centre. The food was honestly so good we started to have visions of nirvana. Not like Kurt Cobain but like actual metaphorical paradise.If you choose to eat here bring a spare pair of pants and be prepared to leave your existing religion behind.This isn't a review it's a warning. All other pasta has now been ruined for me.Brownies were bitchin' too.Come to Australia, open a restaurant and I will give you my guitar.Peace",
