    "Ended \u00a0up here by accident but could not have been happier. \u00a0Fantastic Italian meal, great service, comfortable environment and top notch service. \u00a0 Just enough out of the way that it wasn't jammed full of tourists either. \u00a0 If you are looking for Italian food in Barcelona, I'd say it would be hard to beat this place.Beet Ravioli in brown butter was divine, save some bread to wipe the bowl clean!Braised beef cheek was perfect, so tender there is no need for a knife.",
