    "Great, quick, and friendly service, nice atmosphere (music is good but a bit loud and decor is good), and located in the famous gotic quarter across from a famous opera house. There is bar and table seating and toilets for customers. Perfect sized restaurant as well. I tried the chef's salad 4/5, tuna tataki 4.5/5, and the chicken con salsa 4/5, with a good glass of wine 4/5 3.50\u20ac, and also the banana cake and a cappuccino combo 4.5/5. Very good.",
