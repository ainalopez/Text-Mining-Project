    "Possibly the best meal I've had in Barcelona thus far. \u00a0The menu does change daily and you must have reservation. \u00a0This is the most hole in the wall as it can possibly be which makes it unique. \u00a0The staff is great and friendly, \u00a0will most likely come back! \u00a0If you see Lasagna on the menu go for it!!!!!! Best I've ever had!",
