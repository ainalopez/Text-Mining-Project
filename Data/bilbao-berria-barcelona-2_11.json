    "Bilbao Berria was my first introduction to pintxos, and what an introduction it was!Marvelous bite sized offerings of jamon, tortillas, anchovies, and other Spanish delights all served on tiny little skewers. If I remember correctly each pintxo was priced at a little less than 2 euros, and the beer and tinto verano were both extremely affordable. Great seating in the cathedral plaza, or inside. Bilbao Berria is spacious and well lit. Pleasant, inviting, and delicious. I would highly recommend visiting on an early Sunday afternoon so that you can observe the greek dances that take place in the plaza directly in front of the outdoor seating.",
