    "I know it doesn't need to be repeated but truly: one of the best dining experiences you'll ever have and the best food in Barcelona by far. Definitely have a bottle (or two) of the house cava. It's phenomenal. We got there early so had no problem with lines or crowds (though it was full and had a queue by the time we left a half hour later).We had:- Goat cheese stuffed peppers (ordered these twice)- Jam\u00f3n (buttery, silky, fatty, delicious)- Manchego (it's not JUST cheese, it's the best damn cheese you'll ever have)- Tuna and sardine with olive with black pepper on bread- Tuna rolled in hot red peppers on bread- Potatoes with cheese, creme fraiche, and bacon (we ordered these twice they were so good)- Salmon with roasted red peppers and garlic- Tuna on leeks with pine nuts (the FLAVOURS!)Every dish was perfect. Not to mention the fact that the traditional toasted bread rubbed with tomato and olive oil you find everywhere in Barcelona was better here than anywhere else. The service was quick, attentive and full of humour, and the price was right. The decor was simple, rustic and modest. Make sure to get there right when they open and you shouldn't have a problem with crowds.",
