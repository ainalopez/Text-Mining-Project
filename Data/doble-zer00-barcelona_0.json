    "For all the times i have been in Doble 00 i have to say it has impressed me with its fusion dishes most of my visits, the Mosquito roll is the star and the tapas are always varying , lately the quality has gone a bit down, but i will give them a visit to check if they just had a bad day in my last visit.",
