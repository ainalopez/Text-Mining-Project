    "Want some beer? This is a cool spot to go to. \u00a0I tried Granny's Brewery which is a hot beer with some apple and topped with cinnamon and cream. \u00a0Clearly like a warm apple pie. \u00a0The interior of the place has such a cool and chill vibe. \u00a0There's a bar when you first enter and if you turn left there's a place for you to eat and drink; if you turn right you'll see the dining area. What makes this place stand out a lot of the service of the waitress. \u00a0 She was attentive and was knowledgeable about beer ans was also welcoming. \u00a0I'd love to come back here again.",
