    "My first attempt at Thai in Barcelona - and I'll have to admit that it was pretty good. \u00a0The lunch menu was 13.25 - and while it was slightly pricier than the other local places nearby, I was thankful for the different flavors offered. \u00a0The soup I selected was flavored with Keffir lime and lemongrass, and was delightful. \u00a0 The second plate was the version of what is usually labeled as Pad See Ew in Los Angeles - which is always my favorite go-to dish when I order Thai in LA. \u00a0It wasn't exactly what I was longing for, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. \u00a0It was also exquisitely spicy. \u00a0I have a high tolerance for spicy, and this was a spicy dish... I'd like to return and try a curry dish. The service was fine, as was the setting. \u00a0I'm glad we stumbled upon Thai Manohra - it's definitely a nice option when seeking something exotic, asian, and spicy.",
