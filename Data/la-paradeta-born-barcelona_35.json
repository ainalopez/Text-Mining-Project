    "Delicious, fresh, and simple seafood. This place was amazing. Seafood tasted as it should, not smothered with sauce, but its flavors were cooked out to perfection. This place is not cheap, but you pay for what you get, and what you get is a meal of the freshest seafood and only seafood, not a plate supplemented with cheap carbs. Would definitely recommend!",
