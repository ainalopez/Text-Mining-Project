    "A gem known by locals only. We went there with our friend from Barcelona and love it. If you like mussels this is the place for you. Large pots of steamed mussels are served with various spices and condiments. You can also get a seafood type pot. Every steamy pot of mussels comes with French fries. Great inexpensive wines. The white wines are best with this type of food. Also they have a local dessert which is a yellow type cake served with a glass of port that you need to pour over the cake before you eat it absolutely delicious.",
