    "You must go here. Sit at the bar, order ANY of their wines (all natural no chemicals) and enjoy. They have a menu in english and spanish to make it easy. Not too touristy and tucked away (but not too far off the main road). We had the baby scallops, cured beef with parm and avocado, \u00a0seared tuna toro and sausage sandwiches. I could try to describe how good it is, but a description won't do it justice. Heaven.",
