    "Five stars for atmosphere. El Nacional is a guaranteed good time, the interior is gorgeous, the staff super friendly and the entire restaurant is alive and loud with laughter. Their tapas are great and also lots of fun, you order cold tapas and waiters walk around with hot tapas for you to choose from as they pass by! Great for groups and celebrations!",
