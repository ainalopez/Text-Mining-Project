    "The general atmosphere of the place is nice. They also have outside terrace. Dishes were visually attractive but, when it comes to taste, for the price, it was really only \"ok\". Desserts were not so attractive neither, so we decide to not take it at all. Also in terms of staff, the manager seemed to be not so welcoming and even cold. No smile at all. Really not commercial.",
