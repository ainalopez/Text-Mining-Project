    "Astounded. Went for lunch with my husband who usually cringes at the thought of a vegetarian-only restaurant and even he was blown away. This tiny restaurant is huge on flavor and food passion. \u00a0Had the most delicious quiche of my life - pumpkin, leek and rosemary, and the goat cheese/strawberry/arugula salad. Plus perfectly balance fresh fruit/veggie jucies (pineapple-mint-apple was amazing). Best non-tapas meal we had in Barcelona.",
