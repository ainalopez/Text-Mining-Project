    "Hands-down ... Best dinner in Barcelona both for seafood freshness, taste and service. We came two nights and requested the same waiter: Epi from the Phillipine. He is the best waiter ever ... !This place focused on Tapas and rightly so, their tapas is excellent. My wife and my parents love them as well... Their Shangria drink is the best ... Perfect mix !We ordered a number of tapas but two night in a row, we ordered tapa combination covered prawn, clams, peppers, croquette and garlic bread with tomato... it was all yummy.We also tried razor clams tapa and baby squid, which are both excellent. Then fried potato type (not similar like US French fries), which is also perfect.Their beef tenderloin and peeled shrimp are delicious as well. The tenderloin is cooked medium rare, made it tender ! Epi helped us to order that made our experience excellent.., thank you Epi !",
