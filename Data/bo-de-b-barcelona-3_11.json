    "My first visit to this little \"soup nazi\" spot was a turn off -- in that don't try to get a table (and then place an order) out of the strict flow managed by the owner, which meant that our table was given to some jerk Americans ahead of us in line who changed their mind about taking their food to go. But on later visits I warmed up more to the quirky air and found the staff nice people. The sandwiches really are yummy --what sandwich shop usually includes capers?-- and a splendid value. Excellent \"Bo de B\" potatoes too. (Bravas style potatoes but with three sauces.)I wish the raw-meat-always-being-grilled-fresh would fly in a restaurant in my home town. It so much more juicy (in the right kind of juicy meat way) than Chipotle holding grilled chicken in liquid in a warming tray. And if you're vegetarian who eats eggs, they have omelets as an option for your sandwich, too.",
