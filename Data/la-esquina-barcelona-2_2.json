    "We are Asian American, came in, was told there were no tables available in the back and we would need to sit at a dirty table near the door. The staff gave menus and water to a couple seated after us, and took their orders before even wiping our table clean. We didn't have our menus issued after 15 minutes of being ignored, so we left. Steer clear of this place, especially if you are a tourist.",
