    "A gem of a restaurant not to be missed! Definitely one of my favorites while visiting Barcelona for the week. The food was fresh and filling starting with sangria that did not disappoint followed by prawns cooked in garlic and butter (a little messy as you have to peel the shrimp) my favorite was Black Sea bass prepared with roasted garlic- DELICIOUS and for dessert a wonderful creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a glass of Cava. You will not be disappointed ...see for yourself.",
