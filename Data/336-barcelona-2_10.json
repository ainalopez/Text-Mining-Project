    "I have mixed feelings about this place. The starters were nothing special, more like sub-par. It was just bland.The main course (entrecote) were great, like a 4/5. However, I got a hair on my tomatoes but they changed the whole plate without question when I told them about it. But I should'nt need to point that out in the first place and therefore they get a 2/5.The dessert was a joke! My partner had Catalan cream, one of the worst desserts I'v had in a long time. I think it was frozen to begin with since the bottom layer were like a dough and really nasty. I had the pineapple with icecream and it tasted like perfume. The service were ok but not great, they diddnt poor you water and the house wine were not good at all, just bland. I did ask for a full body red but we got a mediocre table wine. I regret that I trusted the previous reviews since I brought my partner here and she was not impressed. Will not come back again.",
