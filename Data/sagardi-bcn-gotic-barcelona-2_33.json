    "Visited on recommendation from a Barcelona friend, as a must see Tapas bar. As I'd never been to a real tapas bar before I gave it a try - and was impressed. You ask for a plate at the bar, then help yourself to the tapas, paying at the end based on the number of cocktail sticks. I had a beer, and my fill of tapas for a late lunch, for around 18 euros.",
