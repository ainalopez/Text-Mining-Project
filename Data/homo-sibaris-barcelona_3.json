    "When I came from LA I was afraid I couldn't find IPA anywhere. But I an on a lucky strike, and IPA is. Thing nowadays in Barcelona. They are a kind of pricy if you compare to the regular mediana. But a couple of them fill you like a good meal. We got here on Friday evening and we ordered two IPA: canvas and Cajun. Cajun for us is better, is drier and it reminds me to lagunitas. We got some bravas and croquetas, the one made with butifarra negra and foie was pretty awesome. The only but was the speed of the service. I will definitively go again",
