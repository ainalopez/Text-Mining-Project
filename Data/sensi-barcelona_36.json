    "Two nights in Bar\u00e7a, two visits to Sensi... That says it all! Delicious tuna tartare, shrimp cevice and wafer-thin slices of swordfish. The paella & goats cheese salad are both quote good, but when the seafood offerings are as good as they are, it'd be a shame to stray from them.Ambiance was cozy & intimate, and the staff friendly & knowledgeable. The white wine (Naia Sauvignon) was an excellent pairing to the food, as indeed was the delectable Monica V for company.Sensi - a veritable feast for the senses & soul",
