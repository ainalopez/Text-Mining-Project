    "Make a reservation ahead of time! Even on a Monday 8PM we couldn't get seats but luckily there were bar seating for three. After we settled in and ordered a round of sangria (very strong!) we were ready to try the gourmet tapas. My brother, sister and I ordered 11 dishes total. In order of my favorite to least favorite:Pork loin with eel sauce - large slices. blends well with the sauceMussels with tomato sauce - sauce has a kick to it. Good with bread.Salmon - around 9 pieces very tenderBeef fillet Cheese platter Seafood paella - too salty",
