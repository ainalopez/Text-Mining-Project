    "Great food by the beach. Modern tapas. I came to spaon is search for great tapas. Yea theres the classics which gets pretty repetitive but this joint offers a great way of having modern tapas with a spanish flare. Server was great and the restauant shows a cool open kitchen concept. Cooks work clean which is great to see. Anyway we ordered vegetable pannacotta topped with smoked mackerel. This was such a cute dish was made in a small jam jar garnished with tamago eggs. Get this!! We ordered skate cooked a certain way this is an acquired taste mush texture mild flavour. \u00a0Ordered the octopus and pork jowl rice, this took a while since rice was cooked to order it could be just me but i prefer my rice fully cooked. This was crunchy. Beef cheeks wad great dish too served with beans topped eith plantain chips. Veal ribs with cheese mashed and veg this was so good it was served on a skillet cheese got crunchy on the edge! To die for. Finished with chocolate salt and crackers. Was good too no complaints. One of my best dinners in spain!",
