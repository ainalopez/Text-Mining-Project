    "What a great hidden gem! The decor is comfortable yet elegant and the food was delicious. We went on a wed night and had no problems getting a table without a reservation. My husband and I shared the eggplant parmesan, seafood gnocchi, a braised lamb dish with polenta and potatoes, and a pistachio mouse. \u00a0Even though we were sharing the dishes they had no problem plating them in 2 separate portions. \u00a0The presentation was gorgeous and the portion sizes were perfect. The eggplant parmesan was nice and light with not too much breading and beautiful fresh basil, the gnocchi was fluffy with a light broth that was to die for (I definitely used my bread to sop it up) , and the lamb was fall-apart tender with a nice crust. The service was great as well, they had an English menu but were still eager to give any explanations or recommendations as needed. The chef came out afterwards to say hello and inquire about the meal and gave us some complimentary limoncello. My only complaint is that they didn't seem to serve wine by the glass, but we easily went though a whole bottle over the course of the meal so clearly it wasn't that much of an issue for us.",
