    "What a lovely surprise! My husband and I took a chance and walked into tonka, after our first choice restaurant was fully booked, on our way to the magic fountain show. We had heard nothing about it, but it looked good enough and we were tired of walking. And boy, are we glad that we took a chance!First of all, they have a great \u20ac2 ca\u00f1a y tapa deal everyday of the week from 6- 9 pm and all day on Sundays. The tapas were all simple, but delicious.We also ordered some flat bread with Jamon and Parmesan, and eggs with potatoes and chorizo. Perfect! But the absolute star of the night were the goat cheese rolls with mango on top. Crunchy on the outside, gooey cheesy goodness on the inside. It wasn't fried and was very light and refreshing. Probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. Seriously, you must order these bad boys.",
