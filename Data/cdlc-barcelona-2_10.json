    "Great experience here. Highly recommended if you still want a beachfront \"scene\" resto experience with better food and service than other nearby locations. Staff was attentive and courteous from start to finish. They kindly accommodated a fifth friend who joined us and when I mentioned at the beginning of the dinner that there was a time constraint we were able to finish our dinner in time. Sashimi tasted good and fresh, fish and meat dishes quite good (duck, black cod and steak especially), although portions were agreed to be smaller than expected.It's a bit expensive for what you're getting in terms of food, but of course that's only part of the experience. The location is beautiful and fun. Maybe next time I return I'll get a rubdown from one of the masseuses available to diners!",
