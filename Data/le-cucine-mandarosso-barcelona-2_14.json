    "If you like pasta, this place is for you! Their specialty is pasta, made fresh in house. You can order a full plate of pasta with your choice of Italian sauces (the menu changes daily). They also have some baked pasta dishes (lasagna, etc.) and one or two meat plates, but the menu is mostly pasta. They also have a nice selection of Italian espresso drinks and other beverages, using Italian portion sizes (large plates of pasta, small beverages). \u00a0One great thing to note is that they're open on Sundays when many other restaurants and businesses are closed.If you like watching the cook at work, get a seat in the back room.",
