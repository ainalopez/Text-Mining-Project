    "I think This place is very impressed with itself. To be sure, the service was fantastic during our visit, but, in my opinion, the food was just OK for the price. Still, if you're looking for very upscale Spanish food in a non-touristy environment, this place will deliver in spades: I'm not really big on foie gras and dishes with squid ink in them, but I try to keep an open mind. At the end of the day, I'll usually keep things pretty simple. The exception for me was the sliced raw pork that is served with a hot, salted stone so that you can cook the meat yourself at the table. That was pretty different and very tasty. Be sure to toss some if the fat on there early to render it and help crisp the other meat. It makes a tasty bit to eat at the end as well.",
