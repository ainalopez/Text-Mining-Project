We tasted the following things which were all fantastic, fresh and perfectly seasosned: grilled avocado with romescu sauce, mushroom with sausage, serrano ham, potato with cabbage and bacon, local sausages...please note, these were not the real names but its essentially what they were and sooo good.",
