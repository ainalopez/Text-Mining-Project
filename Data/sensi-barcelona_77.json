    "Sensi is a nice intimate place with a lovely atmosphere. You can come here with your friends or with your date. The food is good - especially the potato gratin and filet - although not very spanish. I was pretty disappointed of the Paella - it seems like they try to modern cuisine rather than sticking with traditional spanish food. So if you want good food in a nice neighborhood, this is the place.",
