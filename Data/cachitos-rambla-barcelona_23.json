    "Solid choice in Barcelona. Convenient location, multilevel restaurant/bar that turns into a happening club with good looking people on weekends in the immediate vicinity of the Passeig de Gracia area (short walk from the Alma hotel I stayed at).Your choice of tapas or an unbelievable cook to order seafood grill on the middle level, where I ordered an unbelievably good tasting tuna steak smothered in Spanish olive oil and served with delicious garlic. I accompanied that wonderful meal with some great Rioja wine and finished it off with a Philadelphia cheesecake topped with cherries served on a graham cracker crust.Not the cheapest restaurant in Barcelona (a bit more expensive than many of the popular tapas only restaurants), but very good food and an equally enjoyable ambiance. I dined solo and the entire staff (waitress, manager, chef) went out of their way to make sure I enjoyed my meal. Would definitely return.",
