    "Visited a while ago, but compelled to write this as it's one of the best dining experiences in my life! \u00a0Got the set meal which I usually do when going for the full experience of a particular fine dining establishment. \u00a0Flawless.Expensive but well worth it. \u00a0Service also impeccable.Lasarte deserves the 2 Michelin stars & then some, as compared to the other Barcelona 2 star restaurant, Enoteca. \u00a0Like night & day... That place was hokey & some plates, actually barely edible!",
