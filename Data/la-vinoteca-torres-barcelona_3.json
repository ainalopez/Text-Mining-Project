    "We stumbled into this place on NYE and didn't have a reservation. They were very kind to accommodate us. The people were nice and a kind waiter told us where to go for a good bar after which was very helpful. I only give this place 3 stars because we ordered a couple things off the menu... Including the risotto. Stay away from the risotto. It was the most bland dish I have every had. It wasn't creamy, no salt, no flavor. And for 16 euro... We were very sad. But the potatoes bravas was pretty excellent. It's a pretty place, with good people, but such disappointing \u00a0risotto ...",
