    "Great hole in the wall. \u00a0Took our two small kids here and while it's quite small, it was perfect for them and the parents. \u00a0Amazingly authentic Mexican food if you're looking to escape the traditional Spanish tapas. \u00a0They made cheese quesadillas for the kids, and I'll say the beef tacos were simple yet awesome. \u00a0Parents had Margs (the wife liked guava the best) and I had a Pacifico to top things off. It was the coldest beer I've had in weeks. \u00a0Highly recommended if you're just looking for a low key hole in the wall with really good food and cold drinks.",
