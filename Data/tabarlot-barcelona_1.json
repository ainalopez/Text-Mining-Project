    "I discovered this great Tapas Bar just 50 meters off Las Ramblas. I was in my way back to my hotel. It is a great Tapas Bar that is a welcome change from some of the expensive eateries under tents at Las Ramblaa. Tabarlot has quality food and great service. It is one of those places you value as a true find. I think you know what I mean because we have all have our \"special\" places. Try it. You will love it. I had the Spanish Olive sampler and they were so good with seeds and all. You know seeds are virtually non existent in USA due to our lawyer friends. Olive=seed= duhhhh. Anyway, you'll love it. I did not just eat olives, just happen to be an olive freak. Shrimp with garlic was outstanding. Sangria brought a warm Spanish feeling to my soul and the aged Spanish Jamon pleased my taste buds in a special way not usual. Muy Bueno!!!!!",
