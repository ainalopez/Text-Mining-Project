    "Great local experience...two people enjoying appetizers, beer, and meal for $21 euros couldn't ask for more. The server spoke enough English to help us read over the menu and the ability to people watch is an added bonus...the potatoes were so yummy and a must try...they are extremely busy and run out of certain empanadas but this place is definitely worth a visit while in Barcelona...I will be back tomorrow",
