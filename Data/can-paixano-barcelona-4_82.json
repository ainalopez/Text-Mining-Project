    "All the positive reviews pretty much sums it all up. \u00a0This place rocks. \u00a0If you are scared of crowds, have trouble asserting yourself and don't like to make friends with strangers, this is not your place.BUT, If you like cheap and tasty bubbly, fatty bacalao sandwiches (bocadillo) and don't mind meeting a new friends from all over the world (ok, I have a flare for talking people up), then you HAVE to come here. \u00a0I could eat a rich little bacalao sandwich \u00a0right now :dMy life's enjoyment includes eating at places like this - well crafted food served casually and working people prices. \u00a0Tips: \u00a0They closed at 22:00 (earlier than the rest of the whole darn city). To avoid the insane crowds, go earlier in the day. \u00a0Enjoy this place and the rest of Barcelona!",
