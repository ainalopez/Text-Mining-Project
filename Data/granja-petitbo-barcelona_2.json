    "Very nice decor and good vibe, as well as friendly staff. We ordered the yoghurt, toast with avocado and the eggs Benedict with spinach. We also had a large juice and one tea and one coffee. The bill was 30 euros in total, so a bit pricy. The food looked good, but was a bit boring to eat - the quality was ok, but there was a need for a special touch, such as spices or other nice details. In total, the good vibe and the ok quality made it nice, but we really needed that extra touch in the food - especially at the relatively high price.",
