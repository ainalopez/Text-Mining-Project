    "Loved the Pennucchi vermouth over large rocks with a spritz bottle on the side, nori rings fried with sesame seeds, aceituna (olive gels filled with savory juices), turistas (artichoke heart stuffed with pepper and topped with anchovy), mackerel sushi bits, razor clams in the mildest mustard sauce possible, creamiest ham croquette ever, crisp crusted pan con tomate, and calamari sandwich with aioli and kimchee sauce! Friendly but seriously perfectionist staff chose most of this for us and attended to every detail, and made us feel at ease enough to take all the time we wanted. Couldn't be better!",
