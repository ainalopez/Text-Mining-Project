    "Came here for dinner after deciding an hour wait at Cervecer\u00eda Catalana was too much. This place is beautiful inside, its half restaurant, half specialty good store (shaped like a U). The decor is very West Village. Their best dish is the grilled octopus, which is served over potatoes and in the spicy oil you'll encounter all over Barcelona. Their provoletta with oregano (essentially melted cheese in a small iron skillet) \u00a0was delicious. We came back for lunch another day, spinach ravioli is home made and quite good. We also got the eggplant chips drizzled with honey (very light actually, and elegantly served). I got the grilled fish over spinach which was very light - \u00a0all of the food here tastes fresh and isn't overly elaborate (in the good way) For dessert try the apple tatin - I'd come back here just for this, the apple was cooked to perfection on a very thin cookie crust (tatin is usually on phyllo dough, but this worked well)",
