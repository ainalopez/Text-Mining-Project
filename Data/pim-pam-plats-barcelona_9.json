    "When staying in Barcelona for a few days, I asked some friends who'd been here quite often where they recommended I should eat a good burger. Their answer was short: \"Pim Pam !!!\" So Pim Pam it was!I was a bit surprised at first as I thought it would be a \"real\" restaurant and not a fast-food, but the taste of my burger and fries and the great atmosphere of the place soon convinced me that it was THE place for a burger! So if you're ever in need of a good burger when staying in Barcelona, go Pim Pam! And they serve beer, so you'll end up staying there almost as long as in a real restaurant, you'll see! :)NB: Prices are also quite cheap and the place gets crowded really fast, so avoid rush hour if you can!",
