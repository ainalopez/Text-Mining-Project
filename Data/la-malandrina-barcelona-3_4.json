    "If you are looking for great food for little money - this is the place to go.We came here with 4 adults and a child on a Friday evening and were lucky to snatch the last table. The restaurant is really small with just a few tables, it could use an interior update and they have no A/C, but these are the only cons since the food and the service are great.We ordered a few bottles of water, 3 x flank steak with fries, a salad with chicken breast and an extra side of fries. The drinks came out quickly, followed by complimentary bread and 2 house-made salsa-like spreads that tasted awesome! Our actual food order came out in no time as well and the steaks were huge and cooked medium-rare just like we ordered them. The meat was really good - actually way better than expected for the price! - and the fries were decent as well.It was a really good meal with a lot of food for less than 50\u20ac including tip. Definitely a worth a visit if you are in the area.",
