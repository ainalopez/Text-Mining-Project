    "Great restaurant for a fancy lunch with a cheap price tag. Great foie gras!!  \u00a0You can tell when you arrive at this restaurant during lunch time, that it's the place to be. There's a line out the door of people waiting for a table. But the staff is very good at getting people seated quickly. \u00a0A friend I made through couchsurfing asked us to come here with her and I'm glad she did! The food was great & so was the ambiance. I haven't been for dinner, but it's definitely a good value lunch.Also, the servers here are all very flirty with Americans. Enjoy!",
