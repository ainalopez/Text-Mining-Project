    "WAY overrated. \u00a0We made lunch reservations and despite coming earlier than the lunch crowd, our \"reserved\" table was in an awful spot, way in the back with no views even though there were plenty of open tables around us. \u00a0We felt service was not friendly and even condescending at times. \u00a0Cannonli was good but the rich man paella and the black ink paella were a little too salty and oily for us. \u00a0The prices were expensive for what we received. \u00a0Even though this is the oldest restaurant in Barcelona, there are way too many better restaurants elsewhere to waste your time here.",
