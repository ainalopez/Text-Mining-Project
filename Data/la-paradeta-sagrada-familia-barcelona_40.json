    "I come from Taiwan, an island where good seafood is plentiful and cheap, and we found this restaurant to be very good!We lined up about 10 minutes before they opened at 13:00, and even then, we had to wait 30 minutes to get to our turn to order. (This was just as well, since we wanted to figure out what to get.)You come here for fresh seafood expertly cooked, and for nothing else: not exceptional service nor ambience or anything. They're not mean or anything, but you are on an assembly line and you're there because you want the food.You order at the front, by a combination of words and finger pointing (pick the seafood, pick the method of cooking), then move along to the bread/drinks/cashier, then find yourself a seat (can be done in parallel), then when your order number is called, pick up at the first window. The first window also packs up any leftovers you need to have boxed to take home. The second window is for dirty dishes.We had fried calamari, raw oysters, cocktail shrimp, and then clams and razor clams a la plancha (grilled then drizzled with butter garlic salt parsley mixture). Was enough for the two of us. The calamari is a bit much for two people: it's tasty, but a pretty big portion.The clams and razor clams were clearly fresh, but perhaps TOO fresh: they didn't expel the sand and grit that you're supposed to do for a few hours before cooking, so guests don't bite into clams with sand/grit! Out of a big plate of these shelled seafood, I only managed to have one without the annoying \"crunch\". That said, it happens to anyone who's served clams at home before, but I was disappointed in this (hopefully one-off) error.Would I come back? Yup. And apparently, they have multiple locations.",
