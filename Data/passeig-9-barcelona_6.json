    "We had a wonderful experience at Passeig 9 on Rambla del Poblenou. \u00a0My wife and son shared the chicken and beef paella and I had the grilled salmon. Both dishes were excellent - the paella was the best I've ever had (yes, I sneaked some of their paella - it was a huge portion). \u00a0The salads were good and the desserts looked wonderful. \u00a0There appears to be a great selection of wines although I just had a cold Estrella with dinner. \u00a0One of the owners, David, and our waitress were very attentive. \u00a0We ate inside due to a light rain but dining outside on the Rambla is great. \u00a0This restaurant is highly recommended!",
