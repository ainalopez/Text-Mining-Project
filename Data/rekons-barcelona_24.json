    "This is empanaderia is always bumpin'. \u00a015-20 selections of savory empanadas, plus sweet empanadas and other desserts, and tasty-looking salads. \u00a0This place has got some indoor seating, and plenty of outdoor seating. \u00a0I got a clara, and a selection of empanadas. \u00a0The service was great--the woman serving up the empanadas was really patient with my Spanish, even though it was really busy, and she even translated a few of the unknowns into English for me. \u00a0After I selected what I wanted, they were put into an oven, and brought to a perfectly palatable temperature. \u00a0The eggplant & cheese, the tuna, the caprese, and the Roquefort with walnuts are all excellent.",
