    "I want to like Sensi - walked in without a reservation as it is our 2nd last night and wanted to get some paella and yelp had raving reviews on Sensi. \u00a0Ambience was nice and cozy. \u00a0Loved It. Restaurant was very full when we walked in at around 10:30. \u00a0That was a good sign. \u00a0We ordered based on the server's recommendation. \u00a0The mussels we ordered were lukewarm and was super salty (double strike!) The ravioli was ok but not great. \u00a0The pork tataki was a standout - was cooked perfectly and very flavorful! \u00a0The small seafood paella was not dry, but only come with 1 shrimp and 1 mussel.We sat at the bar and we saw the team worked really hard but seemed like the place over-committed. \u00a0Has a lot of dirty dishes piling up the bar area, along with dirty stemware. \u00a0Awkward!",
