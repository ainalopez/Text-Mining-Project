    "Favorite meal in Barcelona. Total local spot, small bar with a delightfully displayed tradition and history in Barcelona. \u00a0The pulpo was my favorite dish we had throughout our 10 days in Spain - so tender with a perfect char. \u00a0I nearly drool thinking of it now! \u00a0Highly recommend this spot.",
