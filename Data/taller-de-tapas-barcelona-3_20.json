    "I loved this place! I went on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy, but the service was relatively quick and the food was great. We had some small salads and tapas. The calamari with Mediterranean herbs and sea salt were delicious. We also had some prawns which were very tender. The Galician veal was absolutely delicious. The mussels were delicious as well. We also had a local Catalunyan wine which was very reasonably priced and very good. Plus it's cool that they shot part of \"Vicky Christina Barcelona\" here. :)",
