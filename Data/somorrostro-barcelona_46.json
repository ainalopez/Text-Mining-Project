    "This was a fantastic experience and dinner. \u00a0A small and quaint place, with great service. \u00a0We ordered the three course option and would highly recommend it. \u00a0 Each course had 4 - 5 options to choose from. \u00a0The mussels were outstanding (Thai curry sauce) and the dessert was delicious - exceeded our expectation. \u00a0We found the place through a server (Oscar) at our hotel, Olivia Balmes. \u00a0If you are looking for a non-tapas dinner out but authentic Spanish food...definitely would recommend this place. \u00a0Make a reservation to be safe.",
