    "This is a brilliant concept! Restaurants in the U.S. can really learn a lot from La Paradeta. U.S. restaurants spouting farm to table?...how about displaying the freshness of your ingredients. When you first walk into La Paradeta, it looks like a fish market with cafeteria style seating. You pick out the seafood you want and tell them how you want it cooked (fried, grilled, steamed), you pay, then you wait for your number. It's all self-service with the focus on providing the freshest seafood available. Admittedly, it wasn't cheap, but there was no question about the freshness. We ordered razor clams. It was cooked to perfection and had that sweet sea taste you only get from fresh seafood. The sauce they drizzled on top was addicting. We ordered grilled baby octopus. It had a good char that gave it a nice smokey flavor. We ordered the steamed dungeness crab, it was only $8 but a bit messy to eat. We ordered the oysters. Fresh but ok.Barcelona was overall a good eating city, but La Paradeta stood out for having the best concept. I love the idea of being able to see my ingredients and ensure that what was being served to me had not been defrosted in the microwave.",
