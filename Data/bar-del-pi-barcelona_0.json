    "Some reviewers haven't liked this place, though when my friend and I were wandering around the Piazza del Pi and couldn't find the restaurant we were looking for, I must say I was as apprehensive as anyone to just sit on the plaza and hope for good food. Friend-yelpers know that I leave little to chance when planning: I want the best food in the city I'm in, between what other Yelpers think, and personal recommendations from others who have visited.That all said, sitting at the Bar del Pi meant I was taking a risk, and it was not unrewarded. For breakfast, we sat in the sun and watched the artists set up while enjoying croissants, cheesecake (it had raspberries, so it counts as breakfast food!), tea, coffee and fresh orange juice. It was a delicious, light, rich offering, and despite the weird look I got for ordering cheesecake, our server was friendly and spoke excellent English.The only downside of the experience was the man next to us smoking a cigarillo and making the air generally unpleasant for everyone. But, that's Barcelona for you, definitely not just the Piazza del Pi. Other than that, it was a great morning option.",
