    "Tons of tapas....always busy.This place is a huge tapas bar but mostly the tapas are served to tables even though they have a nice bar just because of how big the place is.It's authentic. You hear and feel the subway every time it passes under. The lighting dims then goes back to full power every minute.The plates are great and the service is incredibly fast although not everyone manning this place is Spanish.You definitely get what you pay for. The prices are reasonable and everything I tasted was very good.Check it out if your in the neighborhood.",
