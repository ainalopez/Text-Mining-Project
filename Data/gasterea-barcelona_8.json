    "Loved this tapas bar! One of my favorite experiences in Barcelona since it's what the locals do. We ended up eating here two days in a row since we liked it so much. The guys who work here are super friendly and were patient with us since we didn't understand the process at first.Get there early so you can order whatever you want or sit towards the back of the bar so you can grab the best selections right when they come out of the kitchen. It starts to get packed around 8:30. No matter how busy the bartenders get they are ALWAYS attentive and will give you whatever you need. I recommend the chicken skewer with yogurt, fried potatoes, chicken curry, cheese with sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese with fig and the crab salad. The pinchos range from 1.9 - 2.9 euro each! (cash only)If you're really nice they might even give you free chocolate truffles! :) Go here to experience Barcelona!",
