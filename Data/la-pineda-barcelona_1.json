    "We stopped in here on one of our nightly Tapas crawls. The place is first and foremost a deli that just happens to sell Tapas. It shouldn't be thought of as a Tapas bar. The beer and cheese was good but overpriced. They appeared to have a loyal following in the back of the store. One drunk guy kept popping out to chat with the guy behind the counter. It would recommend stopping in to oogle the deli case, then keep on walking.",
