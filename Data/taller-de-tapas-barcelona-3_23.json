    "Taller de Tapas is a mini chain with 5 restaurants so far, offering different Tapas (small portions of various foods), deserts and more.We went to this Taller de Tapas to have lunch. At noon they also offer weekly 3 course menues, all together for 11.95euro. The sizes of the portions are okay, not so much if you are really hungry, but very tasty and a good price given for the quality. For example, we had various marinated vegetables as appetizer, grilled cod with tomatoes as main dish and daily tarte (in our case, chocolate tarte) as desert.You can also sit on the terrasse of the restaurant but beware, there is an 15% extra to the costs.All together, very stylish restaurant, good food, maybe a bit pricier than the usual tourist restaurants but definitely worth it.PS: A personal remark, this restaurant was featured in the Woody Allen movie Vicky Christina Barcelona with Scarlett Johansson, we found out purely coincidental only when we saw some pictures of Woody Allen and the actress near the entrance of the restaurant.",
