    "Michelin star blah blah. \u00a0Yes the food was good. The plating, presentation, service, and all was very well done. \u00a0The food options were creative, but I expected the food to be more memorable. \u00a0For this price and hype I would think my mind should be blown, but it wasn't. \u00a0Someone else booked this place and I'm sure it was 150-200 euro per person. \u00a0They do a great job, but I'm just too down to earth to really appreciate or desire this hype. \u00a03.5 stars.",
