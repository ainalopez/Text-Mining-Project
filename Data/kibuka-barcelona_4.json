    "This was among the best sushi I've ever had, and certainly the best meal (which is saying a lot) in Barcelona. Order the spicy tuna maki. It's simple yet perfectly balanced in flavor and spice. The California maki is another winner. The miso soup with seaweed was divine, and we split the fried rice with mixed seafood as the main entree. Perfect amount of food, reasonably priced. The best part is this is nestled in the heart of La Gracia neighborhood, so this is a local spot. No tourists here! (Except for us!) Enjoy!",
