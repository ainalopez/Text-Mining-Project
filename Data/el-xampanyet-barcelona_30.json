    "We stayed in El Born and didn't realize that Xampanyet was a few blocks away. \u00a0Samantha Brown featured this place on the Barcelona episode and we just had to try it. \u00a0It's on the block where the Picasso Museum is located. \u00a0It gets crowded so go early or late. \u00a0We found a spot at the bar and cava was served immediately. \u00a0The bartenders are awesome. \u00a0Attentive and always making suggestions without being pushy. \u00a0 \u00a0 I'm not an anchovy fan but since Samantha Brown had it, we had to try it too. I bit salty and sour from vinegar but I did enjoy it. \u00a0They gave us a sampler of the seafood. \u00a0Excellent and we ordered more mussels. \u00a0Jamon on bread was great but the star of the night was the tomatoes. \u00a0Omg. \u00a0Have to get the tomatoes. \u00a03 glasses of cava and all the tapas came out to $27 euros. \u00a0We didn't even check prices. \u00a0Just start pointing or let them make suggestions. \u00a0A really great Barcelona experience.",
