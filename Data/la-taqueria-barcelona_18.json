    "English & Spanish Review from a MexicanMy hubby and I are from California & we have been traveling Europe for the past few weeks. After visiting La Sagrada Familia, he said \"I wish they could sell some tacos and burritos\". My honorary Mexican has gotten wayyy too used to Mexican food being sold left and right back at home, and I guess began to miss it..haha. I looked at him and said..\"no way theyd sell that here!\" Lol and for some reason I chose to YELP restaurants and low and behold \"LA TAQUERIA\" was 4th on the list. We knewww we had to make our way here! We didnt have reservations but luckily there was one table open! Let me tell you, everythingggg from the Micheladas, to the Salsas to the Nachos to the Tacos and the Alambre de Al Pastor were honestly honestly something that would come out of my grandmother's kitchen, meaning absolutely DELICIOUS, perhaps because this restaurant is run by true Mexicans who chose to settle in Barcelona. I totally fell in love with the non-chalant, fun ambiance they create here! Take it from a Mexican, who knows a thing or two about Mexican cuisine from Mexico and California, this place is the closest thing to Mexico itself on this side of the world! Please go visit this place for authentic food! Fue un encanto total visitar este restaur\u00e1n que sirve platillos al igual de ricos que la linda tierra de mis padres, su M\u00e9xico Lindo y Querido! Los meseros y los cocineros son M\u00e8xicanos que decidieron plantar raizes en Barcelona, asi que se trajieron el rico saz\u00f3n con ellos desde M\u00e9xico. Las micheladas, los nachos, los tacos, y la alamabrada de al pastor fueron una delic\u00eda! Si buscan un lugar con comida aunt\u00e9ntica M\u00e9xicana, les recomiendo este lugar de todo coraz\u00f3n! Gracias por la rica comida y la bienvenida!",
