    "We got the recommendation from our tour guide man from Madrid to come here. \u00a0We went there for lunch on our first day to Barcelona. \u00a0Amazing location by the old port and great service. \u00a0They're famous for their paella dishes and seafood. \u00a0Everything we ordered was great and met our expectation. \u00a0It was so good, we're going back for dinner on our last night in Barcelona to try different dishes. \u00a0Highly recommend this restaurant to all.",
