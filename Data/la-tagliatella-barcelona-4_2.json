    "This was our first stop right off the plane. It was not a tourist spoiled hotspot, that's what I liked about it the most. Don't remember if they spoke English, but they definitely had English menus. This is an Italian place so you can find pastas and pizzas for every taste. They served pizza on a very thin crust (how I like it), so it was very light. Must have :). Also since your are in Spain, make sure to ask them for fresh squeezed orange juice (almost every place in Spain makes it).",
