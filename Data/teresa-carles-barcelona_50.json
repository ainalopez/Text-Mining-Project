    "Even if you don't get the brunch here (it's nothing special), you MUST get the Vegan Vampire juice. We ordered a spinach casserole to share - let's just say the description on their newly introduced brunch menu sounded much better in print than what you are really getting (picture this; warm spinach topped with two warm raw eggs, stir fried mushrooms and then topped with more warm spinach, super healthy but not our thing). The coffee was nice as well. Really nice ambience and it's located near a lot of great shopping. I would definitely come back to try their lunch menu. That juice though...#bestjuiceever",
