    "Very trendy hip place! Found this place whilst walking the streets. Nice tapas menu with a good selection. Also had a copy in English.  We had the Catalan cheese plate, tomato bread (a top fav here in Barcelona!) and bacalhau- salted cod fritters. But not forgetting the burratta with rocket & pomegranate ( on the menu it stated with sweet accompaniment, turns out it was the pomegranate and I rather liked that! ) The bottom of the bowl was just goey cheesy goodness.Good wine list and great service as well",
