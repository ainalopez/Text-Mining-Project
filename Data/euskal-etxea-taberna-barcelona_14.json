    "Poor service. \u00a0For poor explanation on how you pay for your food here. \u00a0You keep track of toothpicks for payment. \u00a0This was not explained and when a toothpick was thrown away by our group not knowing its importance it was replaced by A USED TOOTHPICK FROM A DIRTY PLATE PUT ON OUR PLATE OF FOOD. \u00a0When this was pointed out they were very rude. \u00a0Also I have a food allergy and when I asked to make sure the food I chose was for me was safe they were very rushed and made me feel as if I was bothering them. \u00a0Avoid at all costs as there are a million better options in Barcelona. \u00a0By the way, the food was only decent.",
