    "Remarkably busy restaurant just off Las Ramblas and virtually next door to Los Caracoles. We were warned before hand that we should be prepared to queueand queue we did. Actually, I think we were quite lucky with only having to queue outside for half an hour (and I don't normally like to queue like this but such was the reputation). For very good prices you can get fed remarkably well here. Whilst I wasn't being entirely adventurous it is here I tried my first paella - and I thoroughly enjoyed it. A few glasses of sangria later (I was doing the text book here) and I was positively charmed by the whole experience. The restaurant is a modern looking affair (mere feet away from Los Caracoles but miles in terms of decor) and comes supplied with helpful and friendly staff for a fantastic price considering.Try and get there just after eight o'clock in the evening and you should be good to go, without queuing too long (July and August are the busiest times mind).",
