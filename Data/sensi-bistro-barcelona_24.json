    "This place is the real deal for interesting, delicious and high-quality food plus amazingly kind and hospitable hosts and service staff. We had a lot of food, as the previous night we had only ordered 2 tapas each from another place in Gothic and it wasn't enough food. We had burrata with rocket salad, goat cheese salad, duck/potatoe dish, paella, thai chicken. All were prepared superbly and the portions were so generous. We had a great meal. It is a busy place, so you do need rez after 8pm. We will be back with friends!",
