    "Right near the Picasso museum in Barcelona's gothic quarter. We were lucky enough to get a table during the busy part of the day. \u00a0We heard that they specialized in anchovies and that we had to try their house cava. The cava was something like a sparkling white wine. We weren't given a menu and had to tell the waiter what we wanted to try. We tried a sampler plate of different kinds of fish, several tapas with vegetables and anchovies, and one with just cheese, which was the most boring one. The only one I didn't enjoy was the mussels - everything else was good. We came here the day after we had an amazing time at Quimet & Quimet and El Xampanyet didn't quite live up to the standard that was set!",
