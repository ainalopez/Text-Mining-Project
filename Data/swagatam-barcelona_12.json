    "Of all of the Indian places I've been in my life, including going to India itself, these guys know how to cook some damn food. \u00a0Hands down the best Indian food I have ever had. \u00a0On top of that, the staff is always friendly and grateful for your business... \u00a0Great people. \u00a0I'm not one to break down every grain of rice, so I will just say this: \u00a0if you're looking for EXCELLENT authentic Indian food and a very friendly staff that remembers you, this is the place.",
