    "I have never experienced such rude and disrespectful service. I entered the restaurant with 3 friends, extremely excited to try out this restaurant which we passed several times during our vacation and looked pretty good. The waiter at the entrance informed us there would be a 45 minute wait. As we began to discuss what we wanted to do, the waiter simply walked away. Did not ask us if we wanted to wait, put our names down, nothing. He just walked across the restaurant without another word. We thought he was joking at first. We saw the same waiter being much more friendly to other customers who appeared to be from Spain, so we figure he must have something against tourists. I can't speak to the food, but I've never been treated like that at a restaurant.",
