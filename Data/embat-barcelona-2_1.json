    "More of a place \u00a0would expect to find in Copenhagen than Barcelona with tables and bench seats made of pine which provides a conifer sent when one walks in the door - a place to go for a sensory culinary experience versus large amounts of food - everything we had was extremely fresh and well presented - artful as well as good - though like many places my main dish of suckling pig lacked enough of that most magical ingredient, salt. However, for a romantic dinner this is a excellent choice - the focus on natural ingredients makes it a nice follow up to a visit to the nature inspired Sagrada Familia - pricey but out of the ordinary - worth a visit",
