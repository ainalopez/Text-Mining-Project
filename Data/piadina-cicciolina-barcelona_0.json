    "I have spent a week in a hostel just next door to this place, so I used to see it every day when getting in or out. Caught because I like piadina, and partly also because of the name (Cicciolina was a Hungarian porn star, very popular in Italy), I decided to give it a try. All around are photos and newspaper articles about Italian celebrities: a lot of Sophia Loren, Raffaella Carr\u00e0, and obviously Cicciolina. Food-wise, there's a full menu of piadinas, or you can choose your personal one selecting the ingredients from a list. Quality is good, and it's not easy to find a well done piadina out of Italy. The staff is friendly, and we have been chatting all the time while I was there, being the place pretty small. I returned a couple of times to enjoy a good piadina during my stay, and I look forward to returning again on my next trip to Barcelona.",
