    "When people asked me what I missed about my native USA, I'd always say the same thing: \"Cheeseburgers\". Just that. Well, no more. In the past few years, Barcelona has filled up with enough good hamburger joints to put that lament to rest. But De Paula is the best. I've eaten here over a dozen times and the quality has never varied: perfectly cooked burgers on a perfectly-toasted bun, every time. Homemade ketchup & mayo that add the finishing touches to the perfect burger. All at a price that can't be beat: 6,2\u20ac for my fave burger, the most classic model: the Vila-Vil\u00e0. Try it; your only regret will be that De Paula has ruined every other burger joint for you forever.",
