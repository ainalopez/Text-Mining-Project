    "Great Spanish tapas witty modern twist. This place has a great atmosphere and great cooking. The specials on the board were worth checking out. We had the grilled octopus which was so delicious. We also really enjoyed the patatas bravas that came out hot and in a really great sauce. The drinks were cheap. The dishes did end up on the pricier side of things. It can be very easy to keep ordering and add to a growing tab. Would rate this place as worth a small trek to check out.",
