    "Very nice spot on a side street. Came in on a Saturday night and it was quite busy. Seating outside and very limited seating inside. Was quite a small place actually. We has a 40 minute wait for a table but while waiting we ordered food and drinks from the bar. Food was excellent especially the mushrooms in aceite de Oliva. Pan con to mate was just ok as were the albondigas. Boquerones in vinegar were good but I've had better. Sausages were a big hit as were the bravas. Good service too and atmosphere great and lively. We had a 5 year old with us and this was no problem at all. Next time I'd just eat at bar. Bill was cheap, especially the bebidas.",
