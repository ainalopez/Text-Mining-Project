    "We wandered upon this unassuming Italian restaurant and were treates to a great dinner. Il Massone is a low key Italian restaurant with very reasonable prices. Food and service was very good. We had the carpaccio, insalata variata, margarita pizza, and spaghetti carbonara all of which was delicious. I also love the quaint cozy feel of this place. When we first arrived, friends of the chef arrived with a guitar. They jammed for a few min before sitting down for a meal. Love it!",
