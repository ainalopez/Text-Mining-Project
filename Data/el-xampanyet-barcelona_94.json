    "Top tapasIf you only go to one bar in Barcelona (unlikely as that is), make it El Xampanyet. This tiny tiled zinc bar is a real slice of tradition. A family-run business, staff are super-friendly and happy to explain any of the huge range of delicious tapas lined up on the bar. Get there early - although watch out for the erratic opening hours - grab a table in the back bar, order a bottle of the house speciality cava, tuck in to a selection of pinchos and relax.",
