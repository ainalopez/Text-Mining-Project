    "We were craving burgers for lunch and Bacao had the best reviews in the area. I'd have to say, the food certainly lived up to the hype. Bacao is a sit down place, but you wait in this line to order (i.e. build your own burger) and then find a table, if you can, and they bring the finished product to you. There are a ton of different combos you can choose from and all of the food is delicious. I wouldn't call it fast food, I would call it really good food, fast.",
