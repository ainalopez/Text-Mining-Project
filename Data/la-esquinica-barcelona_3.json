    "This is a great spot for tapas. Locals come here and you don't see tourist. Which is a plus. Tapas are not so expensive here since its where the locals go. And you don't get the tourist price. We would have gotten half of what we ordered and paid the same price. Thanks for my cousin go brought us here. It is a wonderful place and it's always busy. I'd come back. Baby squid was a little to salty.Big squid was not bad. Sausage bread was actually good but they charge you by the sausage. Whack!Potatas bravo always good how can you go wrong with fried potato, mayo and some kind of spicy seasoning.Stuffed mussels are yum.Octupos was Delish very different from how I normally eat.. SushiPepper like food was yummie not spicy. Spanish cheese oh so good and mix with the potatas brava. MmmmGreat tapas and fast service. Super fast I guess they want you in and out cause they do have a long line especially at dinner time.",
