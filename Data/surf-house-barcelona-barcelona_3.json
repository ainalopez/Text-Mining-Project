    "Great atmosphere and location - has a very relaxed, lounge-y feel with great music, drinks, and food. We stopped by because we liked the music and the great people watching spot on their terrace. The cava sangria was refreshing and tasty. Headed back later that day and grabbed lunch: their club sandwich was good, nothing mind blowing but tasty and filling. Also had a bucket of beer and just watched the people pass by on the boardwalk. Would definitely recommend.",
