    "Very close to a grouping of hotels, and only a couple blocks from one of Gaudi's masterpieces, the pizza is great. Let me add, I hate thin crust pizza. I don't know why people love it so much. It's, in general, too crunchy, easily burns, has no flavor, and is messy with crumbs and flakes going everywhere. I've just never enjoyed it. Il Massone's pizza is pretty thin. But it's not overly messy, nor is it soggy, nor is it too crunchy. It holds up, it's flavorful, and their selection was varied. We only had a pizza, but one of our neighbors had some starters and enjoyed them as much as their pizza. The drinks were cold, the staff was super friendly (not cloying at all, just really pleasant people), and they brought delicious oil and vinegar for the table.Their sign is small, so you have to keep an eye out for it, but it's definitely worth a stop.",
