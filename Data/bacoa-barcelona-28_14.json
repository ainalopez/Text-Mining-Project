    "The burgers are amazing here!! Been in this place few times already and I always end up thinking that I have to come more often!!The queues and the service model could be much better (meaning it would be better to have enough tables and waitresses asking for your order instead of lining up to make the order...). The waiting once you have ordered is very short so thumbs up for that! :DFor the taste... These are one of my favourite burgers ever (and I'm a burger lover), size is just perfect and presentation as well - it spills all over your hands though... HahaEnjoy!!",
