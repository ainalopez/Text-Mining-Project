    "My husband and I planned our trip to Spain last minute so we didn't have enough of a timeframe \u00a0to make reservations at some places we wanted to try but we were lucky enough to get reservations at Cinc Sentits and really enjoyed our (very late) dinner there.Cinc Sentits is a beautiful restaurant- elegantly appointed with the gracious hospitality that seems to be a signtature of the people of Spain. The cuisine is inventive, nuanced, and very skillfully created. We enjoyed the meal and felt it was a good choice for our \"special\" meal while we were in Barcelona. If you are looking to dine at a Michelin starred restaurant with excellent wine pairings and gorgeous and delicious food, I would definitely put Cinc Sentitis on your list.You might wonder why I put four stars versus five and it's simply a matter of preference. My husband and I do not seek out formal dining much anymore and though the experience was without fault, it's not the type of meal we would seek out again or recommend to someone unless they were specifically looking for that type of setting/experience/buget. The four stars is in no way a reflection of the restaurant but merely how I would rate it in terms of my preferences in dining experiences amongst the places we tried in Barcelona.",
