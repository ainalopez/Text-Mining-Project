    "Make sure you order the paella and the seafood mixed plate, great value! \u00a0We were searching for good paella in Barcelona and found this restaurant on Yelp. \u00a0We weren't disappointed, it was exactly what we expected. \u00a0We ordered a lot of seafood, prawns, clams. I'm a seafood lover. \u00a0The seafood mixed plate and the paella are must and that's more than enough for two people. \u00a0There are patio seating available as well, the restaurant itself isn't very big but comfortable enough. \u00a0Service was great. \u00a0Sangria was really good, almost everyone there ordered their sangria.There are many selections in the menu, unfortunately we didn't get to try all, but if you're with a group, there is something for everyone.",
