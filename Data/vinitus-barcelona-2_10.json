    "After 3 weeks in Spain eating out twice a day, this is probably the best overall restaurant we tried. \u00a0The menu is diverse: \u00a0so many options. \u00a0And we tried many. \u00a0From a simple grilled vegetable plate that was cooked and seasoned perfectly to a more sophisticated foie with apple confit dish that was indescribably fantastic. \u00a0My kids learned to love croquettes here; \u00a0they just seemed to have the touch of getting the flavor and frying just right. \u00a0We tried croquettes at a half a dozen other restaurants on our travels and we finally gave up as nothing ever measured up. \u00a0 The service is first rate. \u00a0The restaurant is new, modern and has a great lively feel to it. \u00a0It does get crowded but that makes sense given the quality of the food. \u00a0All this and the prices are really reasonable.",
