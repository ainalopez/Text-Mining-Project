    "Came here twice during my two-week stay in Barcelona. The De Pato crepe, which I ordered during the first visit, was arguably the best savory crepe I have ever had! Then I came here the second time and ordered a dessert crepe; it was pretty good too... But the stars here are still the gourmet savory crepes. \u00a0The price is very reasonable. Come early tho because this place fills up quickly.",
