    "Perfect. Had the classic Jamon Iberico baguette sandwich and not only was it the cheapest meal we had in Barcelona it was also up there with the best -- bonus points for simplicity. They have mini baguettes which are great if you're not too hungry. The beignets were also delicious so give them a try!",
