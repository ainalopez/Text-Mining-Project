    "You need to go here! I was recommended by a colleague to check this place out during my two week vacation in Spain. I didn't do any research and was not expecting much. Boy was I surprised. My bf and I lucked out as we did not have a reservation but snagged a seat (if you're reading this make a reservation). For the service, we were greeted by an middle aged man who seated us and helped us choose a fantastic wine from the Catalonia region at a reasonable prices (el pics, 20\u20ac). Next the waiter himself was a walking menu, navigating my shellfish allergy with what our likes and dislikes. For starters we got the sea bass ceviche. This had the perfect amount of citrus. The fish was delicately cut and it practically melted in your mouth. Next was the egg carpaccio. I can't explain it, but it reminded me of a breakfast hash. Just get it, you won't be disappointed. Next was the suckling pig. Perfectly cooked, well seasoned. But really to top off an already perfect meal was the real star. Their frozen yogurt. It was a caprese salad but in dessert form. Frozen Greek yogurt, tomato jam and basil olive oil. A savory dessert for sure, but with it being perfectly executed to have a tangy yogurt with a naturally sweet tomato, your mind will be blown. \u00a0WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?",
