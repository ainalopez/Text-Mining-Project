    "LOVE love love this place. The waiter was fantastic, he had me try the Basque wine, which was very good so I ordered more. Then you get your plate and pick a little appie , called a \"pinch-o\". \u00a0They make them and keep filling dishes and you eat and pay by the number of toothpicks left in your plate. We tasted so many and all were divine, except that one anchovy one....how I missed seeing that little salty fish wrapped around the olive, I will never know!!! \u00a0Needless to say, this was by far my favorite meal in Barcelona. \u00a0My favorite was a crab one that looked like shredded crab meat...lots of seafood - another goodie was a crab something in a little tiny croissant....there are so many so make sure you arrive hungry!",
