    "What a great small tapas bar in the Gothic Neighborhood. This area is just so full of history and it is just awe inspiring sitting down in the Placa del Rei enjoying a bite to eat and drink.Our server, Anahi, was just so friendly and fast in bringing out our order. We ordered a couple of jamon serrano sandwiches, beer and agua con gas (seltzer water but even better). The sandwiches were very tasty and hit the spot after a day of touring this beautiful city.A plus while we were sitting was that a local started playing guitar right in front of us. It just made our experience even better. The inside of this location is really cool too. I went to the bathroom and it was very clean and it was located on the second floor where there is also a very comfortable lounge area with a balcony overlooking the Placa del Rei. Just beautiful to be surrounded by all this history.The price was very reasonable and we were able to order separate checks and pay with a credit card.",
