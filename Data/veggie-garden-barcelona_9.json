    "A vegan paradise in Barcelona! (you can only eat so many patatas bravas)The food we ordered was super flavorful and delicious. We split the sampler plate between me and my boyfriend. It was filling and a good price. Totally recommend it.The reason this restaurant is only getting 3 stars from me is because they completely forgot our drink order and then, after waiting about 15 minutes after finishing our food to get the bill and went in to pay, they tired to charge us for them and argued with my boyfriend claiming they indeed brought them out. The service was just all around pretty terrible.Perhaps it was a bad day, I'd still like to try it again when I'm back in town.",
