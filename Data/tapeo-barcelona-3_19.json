    "This place is right across from el xampanyet but it was too busy and we wanted to sit down instead of squeezing into the bar area. Tapeo offers up seating at the bar or by twos along the side or one group table for about 6-8 people. It's tight but more calm than across the street. That was about a 30 min wait on Friday at 1030 pm. There is an English menu and our server spoke perfect English. Drinks are cheap. 4 euro for glass of cava or sherry. 3 euro for any of the wine by the glasses on the board. 2.50 for bottled water and 7 euro for half litre of sangria. Dishes can range from 2-12 euros with most averaging 8 euros each. We ordered 6 dishes plus the toaster tomato bread which was so good plus 4 drinks and it was about 65 euros. Really liked the dressed potatoes with salmon and wasabi 7.50 - like the best potato salad ever. Ensaladilla with tuna belly 4.50 was a great deal for the tower of tuna and lovely wasabi sauce you get. The pincho moruni of lamb with mint sauce 5 euro was seasoned and cooked perfectly. Glazed cheek beef with potatoes 9 euros was soooo tender it melted in your mouth - one of the best braised cheek beefs I've ever had. Saut\u00e9ed vegetables with mushrooms tasted like a good stir fry but overpriced at 7 euros - order something else. Service was fast and well paced. Our English speaking server was no nonsense but still pleasant as she was run off her feet. Great place near the Picasso museum.",
