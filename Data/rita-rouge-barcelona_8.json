    "We are almost done with two weeks of traveling Europe and stumbled upon Rita Rouge in Barcelona, Spain last night. By far the best meal we've had this whole trip. Every single dish we ordered was cooked to perfection and soooo delicious. Steak and shrimp fajitas, teriyaki veal strip with veggies and potato, sangria (YUM!!!), dulce de leche crepe, and the best chocolate ice cream with strawberries! We highly recommend this restaurant if you're visiting Barcelona. It appears to be a local favorite. We sat outside which was lit up with lights and was very comfortable even though its set up on a pedestrian walkway. The host and waitress both spoke English and couldn't have been nicer. All in all, it was a great experience.",
