    "This was the best food we had while in Barcelona. \u00a0The place was packed, but the line moved quickly and the food came out fast after ordering. \u00a0The burgers are truly great in every way. \u00a0I got the classic and my wife got the one with blue cheese and both were exceptional. \u00a0A must while in Barcelona when you are ready for something that isn't tapas.",
