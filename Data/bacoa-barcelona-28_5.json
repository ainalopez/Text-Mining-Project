    "Food quality: hamburguer was delicious. Fresh products and really tasty beef. The sauces are homemade and tasty. General quality is more than average.Service: just the typical staff behind the desk like a fast-food restaurant. Nothing to be critized. Service speed was just normal.Place: the restaurant is very small, just for eating in 10 min and leave. It's very narrow, specially when is crowded. Not recommended for big groups, you might wait too much time to get a piece of table. Price: affordable. For 12 eur each you might enjoy a big hamburguer with french fries and fresh drink. Price is a little bit more than average but the quality highly worthy pay it.",
