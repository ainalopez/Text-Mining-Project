    "Probably the best Mexican restaurant in Barcelona. Went here on my trip and had a blast! The food is quick and gooooooood! My recommendation? Definitely the nachos con Guacamole and the fantastic Burrito con carne asada! Muy benos!!! The drinks are the best and the prices are cheap, 3,50\u20ac for a Mojito or Margarita. THIS Mojito is definitely a must in Barcelona...",
