    "SPECTACULAR.No, really--this place is everything I love: a dark and casual interior, friendly staff who treat you like family, and from-scratch food that'll made your eyes roll back in your head. When we walked in, a wonderful lady greeted us and cheerfully explained everything. She was so darn sweet--taking ownership of making sure we had a great experience. She went through the entire menu choices:1. Ravioli - This is the house specialty. Two of my friends chose this, and said it was some of the best homemade pasta they'd ever had. 2. Pasta - Think traditional spaghetti, plus a variety of sauces to choose from. 3. Empanadas - The Mister chose these, and I swear he was singing and smiling and making these happy moaning noises. His fave was the carne. 4. Hamburger and potatoes - This was my choice, but more on that...Along with your meal, you get wine, a starter (like an empanada or a salad) and a dessert (like cheesecake, a brownie, or tiramisu). All for less than \u20ac15. When I declared to the nice lady that I couldn't eat gluten (it's actually wheat, but whatever), she didn't miss a beat. She quickly started exploring the menu for some choices I could have, and she made great recos. I ended up with a delicious buffalo mozzarella salad with homemade pesto and a hamburger without the bun. Everything I had was absolutely delicious. The service here was outstanding--even better than the awesome food. Everyone was filled with pride for their restaurant, and they were extremely humble. Even though this is isn't your typical gf restaurant, they were still super helpful and accommodating. Do your traveling buddies a favor and stop here so they can have fantastic empanadas, pasta, and pastries.",
