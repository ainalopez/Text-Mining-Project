    "Kiosko has a great burger. Nothing too fancy, but it was a solid burger. Good size, too, as most of the burgers I had in Catalunya were bit smaller (perfect size for me, but my husband enjoyed getting a bigger burger!). I liked how you could select from a few pre-made options, but also customise it to your liking.They're potato wedges and fries were great, too.None of their sauces were quite spicy enough, though--but that's Barcelona, for ya! Barcelona, you know I have so much love for you, but spicy food is not your strong suit.",
