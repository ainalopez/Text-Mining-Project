    "No need to talk about how good the food was. They serve the most delicious Catalan extra virgin olive oil called ' Les Trilles' . Period! \u00a0This has a very light aromatic delicious taste that you think it can be converted into a beverage and drink along with pasta.( At least I do ) Another distinctive side of the place is the terrace. Spring and summer times with DJ music, infinity pool are 'de puta madre!' Terrific!",
