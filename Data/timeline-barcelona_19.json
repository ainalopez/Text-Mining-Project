    "This was the best food my girlfriend and I had in Barcelona and it's not in a touristy area, which made it even better. The ambiance was amazing with a black and white movie playing off a projector. Service is outstanding thanks to Carlos. Drinks are amazing as well! I recommend the croquettas abs avocado salad and for dessert, the banoffi was a fantastic!!",
