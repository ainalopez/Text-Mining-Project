    "I was shocked at how delicious the food was here - The noodles and dumplings are definitely handmade, and the broths are made in-house, which is the foundation of the experience. Expect to wait in line if you show up without a reservation during peak lunch.Don't feel bad about eating Chinese food in Spain, this is a Tapas experience and great food.",
