    "Very cozy middle Eastern tapas bar that is hard to find. They have an upstairs and downstairs with brick walls, candle light and a lounge area with some pillows. It is a very special athmosphere there.It is a very small tapas bar with the aim to bring together the rich and spicy flavours of the Arab world with the strong and varied tastes of Spain to give the guests an unique culinary experience. The waiter is very obliging and helps us with the assortment of our menu. We were extremely impressed by him because of his hearing disability, but he managed to get all our orders and requests with no problems! But he can not speak Englisch, only a few words \u00a0he wrote them down on his writing pad.The menu options are very limited, mainly hummus type dips, bacon wrapped dates and spicy soups. We had the lunch menu for 20 EUR (excl. drinks) and had the choice of 4 Dips, 6 Tapas and 3 desserts. So we took the spicy Pumpkin, Fig & Ginger Soup and that was very good and very spicy \u00a0not for wimps! :-)After that we had the Aubergine dip and the Bacon, Caramelised Leek & Goats cheese Dip with typical libanese bread. It was soooo delicious and had an extraordinary taste. After that we got the bacon wrapped dates and the tomato-smeared bread, toasted with Rosemary, Garlic & Thyme. The dates were very good, but the bread is same like at other italian restaurants. For the sweet tooth we had some little baklawa and panellets (almond and nougat pieces). That was presented on a black slate. Cool idea. In conclusion, I would say, that this was the best fusion experience Ive ever had. And I can absolutly recommend the Zirayb!",
