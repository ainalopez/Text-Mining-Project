    "The Vegetarian Pepita was delicious and a welcome break from fish. \u00a0It was served with a nice portion of saut\u00e9ed spinach on the side and a delicious olive paste. \u00a0The bread is slices so thin it is more like a salad than a sandwich. \u00a0The bread is toasted and crispy so I cut it up like croutons. \u00a0Sangria was good but the smallest serving I've had in a week in Spain.La Pepita was busy at 3:00 so instead of waiting for a table we were quickly seated at the bar. \u00a0Friendly and attentive service. \u00a0If there weren't so many planes to try in a limited amount I time in Barcelona, I'd go there again.",
