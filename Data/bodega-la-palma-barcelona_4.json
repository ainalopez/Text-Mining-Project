    "A cool place to hang out, grab a drink, eat some appetizers, and soak in the local Barcelona crowd. At least it looked like locals. We weren't too impressed with the food offerings, but the vibe of the place made it worth our while. TipIt is a bit of a twist and turn to get to this place, so try to figure out a rough path to follow before you look for it.",
