    "Had their chocolate donut to go and saw they had chai tea latte (which I'm obsessed with) so I asked for one but they were out (she made it sound like it wasn't just temporary...) and offered something else \"almost the same\" instead. Well it had nothing to do with it and tasted kind of meh but whatever.The donut was extremely good though! Definitely worth it. My non vegan friends asked for more and they both said it was much better than a \"regular\" donut. Vegan win!Too bad the staff ignored us for 5 minutes when we came in (even after saying hi twice, and yes they saw us), looked annoying we ordered something and didn't say bye when we left. Not sure the donut is worth it...",
