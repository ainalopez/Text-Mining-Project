    "Our experience was a little different than the previous reviewer - we just flew in from New York and are also staying at le meridian. \u00a0We enjoyed the downstairs (and we thoroughly enjoyed the pizza we split) and thought the service was very good. I guess u can't judge the food or service from one experience but I would definitely give this a try if you're staying across the street. Based on the previous reviewer we will b trying the upstairs tomorrow or the next day.",
