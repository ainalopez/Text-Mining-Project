    "An Italian restaurant nestled on side street off a major intersection in Barcelona. They only have peroni on tap, hey it's an Italian restaurant so why not? While on vacation in Barcelona I went there 2 nights. The pizza there is amazing it reminded \u00a0me of Italy. Fresh ingredients and an actual Italian making the pizza. A must try!!",
