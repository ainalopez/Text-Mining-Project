    "I don't think I've ever gone to the same restaurant twice while on vacation until now. \u00a0I fell in love with Barcelona when I visited and Vaso de Oro played no small part in that. \u00a0The restaurant has a hectic, local feel. \u00a0Food-wise, highlights for me were the steak and foie gras (excellently seared foie gras on a slices of medium rare steak), pimientos de Padr\u00f3n (crisped and salted to perfection), and the Manchego cheese (staple when in Spain). \u00a0Very much looking forward to visiting again when I go back.",
