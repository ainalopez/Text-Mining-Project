    "Great ambiance, food and service! The restaurant was recommended by our hotel concierge and we're very happy to have been there. We had the artichoke and wild mushrooms to start, followed by the pan fried escargot (very delicious and it was a pan full...didn't expect such a big serving...if I knew I wouldn't have ordered another entree as this dish was entree size), the duck entree and the octopus with mashed potatoes entree. All were very well presented and tasty. We ended with the souffle topped with vanilla ice cream and meringue...a very nice ending! I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a nice romantic dinner. Price seemed reasonable to me - our total was 59 euros (before tip).",
