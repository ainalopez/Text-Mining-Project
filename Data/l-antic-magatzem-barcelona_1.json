    "Service was fantastic! \u00a0Very, very friendly. \u00a0Even though we were out of towners who don't speak Spanish they took the time to explain the menu in English while they were very busy with other customers. \u00a0The food was a great bargain, 22 Euro for three courses and a bottle of wine for two. \u00a0Only issue for us is that it seemed a bit too authentic for our palates, a couple of the dishes weren't what we were expecting. \u00a0Dessert was a highlight though. \u00a0All in all a near perfect experience.",
