    "This was an excellent place to dine. Lovely atmosphere with the music and aesthetics. Friendly staff that took the time to explain the menu (which isn't tedious) to help me get the best samples of the day. Also, how can you go wrong when a local patron helps you select the best dishes? Which were amazing!",
