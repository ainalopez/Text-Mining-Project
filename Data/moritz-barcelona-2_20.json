    "Cute place, great food, and excellent vibe. \u00a0The burger was great, as well as the ham sandwich. We really enjoyed our stop here for lunch and the sangria was tasty and a good value. The one thing that I would have liked is the possibility to substitute bread. For example, my sandwich came with white bread and I really wanted anything whole wheat or whole grain and they told me that it was not possible.The prices are very reasonable for a great atmosphere and they have a very extensive menu. The beer selection was great too!",
