    "The food here is ok - traditional, hearty, which means dishes can get rather greasy. We came here at 6am so the crowd here was a blend of wide-awake tourists and hangover locals. We tried a lot of stuff and I think the tomato bread, the rabbit and chickpeas were the best. They have great coffee, which in reality was the only thing I saw locals getting.",
