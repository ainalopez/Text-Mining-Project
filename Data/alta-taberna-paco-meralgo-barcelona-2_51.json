    "A friend highly recommended this place and the interiors were chic and the tapas were certainly very good. \u00a0I did not love the fact that it was mostly English speaking tourists there though as opposed to locals - and I was a solo traveler who was given a seat at a bar facing a brick wall, which felt a bit like I was dining in a Spanish prison (instead of being given a seat in the window or at one of the two actual bars) which would have made for a much nicer atmosphere so I truly wanted to get out of there as soon as possible (which was perhaps the idea as I was the only woman eating alone in the restaurant?) However, I was subjected to a complete SCAM where the waiter slammed down a bottle of water that I didn't order in front of me, opened it, and poured a small amount into a glass. I never ordered, nor wanted, this water and I didn't touch it. When the bill arrived - of course, there was a 3 euro ($4) charge for the water. I informed them that I didn't order it. The waiter claimed he heard me - and refused to acknowledge his error. Then another staff member came over and said she would ask the owner about removing the water from the bill - and she returned saying the owner refused to remove the charge because the bottle was open (not by me.) I pointed out that I never even had a sip of the water and they didn't care. \u00a0Other nearby diners (all American) also found this to be ridiculous - but, the staff could care less. \u00a0I would NEVER recommend anyone go here with practices like that. \u00a0Why risk your reputation over 3 euros - but clearly, they wanted to add more money to the bill of a solo diner and to take advantage. \u00a0Shame on them.",
