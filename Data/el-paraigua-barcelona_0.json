    "We stumbled upon this spot and decided to sit indoors and soak up the air-conditioning. There are plenty of outdoor tables with umbrellas but inside is where it's at! \u00a0We ordered a beer and sangria along with the Grande Paraigua, which is the large charcuterie board with local ham, sausage and cheese. Served with bread and tomato bread (superb), it was enough for our party of four for lunch. Inside is charming and the service was pleasant and effective. Free WiFi to boot!",
