    "One of the most memorable experiences in my travels. \u00a0This restaurant is just amazing. \u00a0The food is wonderful and vibrant, and the service is amazing. \u00a0They make you feel like a part of the family when you dine here. \u00a0My boyfriend's aunt came here a few years ago and fell in love with the place. \u00a0She went a few times and made friends with the owner. \u00a0Then my boyfriend and I went back a few years later and brought a photo of his aunt and the owner together. \u00a0He remembered her well and showed us the photo he had of her. \u00a0It was incredible!! \u00a0I will recommend this restaurant as an absolute must when in Barcelona. \u00a0I wish I could go more often!",
