    "Cat Bar is a cute bar/restaurant in Barcelona that is, you guessed it, cat themed! There's tons of cat stuff all over the place. (I didn't see any real cats) On top of that, it's completely vegan, and by that I don't just mean the food, but all of the wine and beer too! \u00a0Their menu is very tiny, veggie burgers or a veggie sausage (not American style for sure) which you can get with chips (British french fries), salad and or baked beans. \u00a0They also have a veggie breakfast option, but I didn't pay close attention, I'm guessing it was the sausage in some other combination. It's the only completely vegan spot I found, and one of the few vegetarian in walking distance from where I was staying. \u00a0Also, service was extraordinary, they're completely English speaking if Spanish isn't your thing, and really, really nice. \u00a0I think it's a cool place to go, even if you're not vegetarian or vegan. \u00a0And of course, to get my seal of approval in a foreign country, the ultimate test:free wifi!!!P.S. I forgot to write VEGAN and VEGETARIAN in my review so that they come up in a search.",
