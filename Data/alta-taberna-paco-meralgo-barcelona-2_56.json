    "This place is a really nice tapas bar in Barcelona, upscale, interesting, and very good food. \u00a0The service was excellent and attentive, the wine - a 2005 Luis Canas Reserva Red - was outstanding.The only real downside is that the place is small and I would not have minded a bigger selection of tapas. \u00a0But four solid stars with a \"rising\" star towards five.",
