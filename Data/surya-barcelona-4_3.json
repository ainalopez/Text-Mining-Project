    "Good food. Terrific service. Outstanding chic street food vibe !We did a take out/carry out of tandoori chicken and naan (see pictures), and enjoyed the food. The chicken was very flavorful without being spicy, which we liked very much. The naan was soft and had the wonderful clay over taste.The service was quick and excellent. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and spoke perfect English.The seating layout and the interior styling is just so fun (see pictures). Would be great to hang out on the couch and enjoy a drink... Good location too just a block from Passeig de Gracia You can tell this place was done with care and love! It also helps that the restaurant has a very reasonably priced menu. We definitely recommend this place.",
