    "My friend and I loved this place so much we came back not once, not twice, but THREE times during our time in Barcelona. Definitely make it part of your Spanish eating experience!Irati follows the traditional Catalan style of eating, and the concept couldn't be more simple: survey the bar's daily \"pintxo\" offerings, order a drink (I always recommend the \"tinto\" or chilled house red wine), get a plate and choose at your leisure! The pintxos, or bite-size tastes of any number of traditional tapas, each cost 1.95 Euro, a great deal for the quality and freshness of ingredients. At the end of your meal, the waitress counts the number of toothpicks to total up your bill, and voila!Each pintxo here is assembled with the utmost care and respect for flavor and presentation. My friend and I would frequently gawk at how beautiful everything looked! And, of course, there's something for everyone here: sardines, jamon on toast, croquetas with cheese, tortilla espanola...you name it, Irati has it. Come for a few small bites before your dinner, or make a dinner of pintxos - any way you slice it, I guarantee you'll love it.",
