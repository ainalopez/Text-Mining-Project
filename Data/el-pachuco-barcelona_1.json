    "The short version: very good food with fresh ingredients and friendly staff, and English menus for a decent price.The place is small and a locals spot so you know it's a good place to eat. However like I said its small like a lot of local non tourist restaurants in Barcelona. they have only two tables but they have two small bars with stools so you can sit while you eat; but it's going to be cozy. So hope you aren't some \"I need more personal space, get out of my space.\" Type person. Well if you are, then maybe this isn't the spot for you.. Side note: Good luck in life too..But otherwise the tacos are piled high with meat. The guacamole is a very large bowl and chips are made in the restaurant and are not some bag chip crap. The Pima colada was good and the bartender made too much and she told me if I drink what I had quickly then she topped me off again with the remainder in the blender. So i pretty much got 1 and a half drinks. So it's not the cheapest place. But far from expensive.My only let down was they didn't have beef! I was Jonesing for beef dammit. So me and my wife walked miles to get here then there wasn't any beeeeef. So if you want beef , then it's not your spot. But the pork and chicken and vegetable food on the menu is great ; just once again I wanted beef. That's really my only disappointment. Would of given a half star more if They had beef and were a little bit cheaper.",
