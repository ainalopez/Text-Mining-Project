    "Very disappointinng.As a Michelin restaurant. The quality is completely unacceptable, and the flavour is average.Disclaimer (hey at least I'm honest): we did join the Sandeman Tapas tour and that has likely limit what the shop can do. However, if the tour meant they would have to serve absolutely sub-par food. As a restaurant who cares about their brand should outright reject the deal. Period.- shared tapas per table - unacceptable- one tiny cube of chorizo as a tapas - unacceptable - I serve better portion to babies- one tiny croquet as a tapas - you kidding me? Size of my pinky (not exaggerating)- asparagus on goats cheese - the only dish that was reasonable. But as a Michelin star restaurant, using un-fresh/old/aged asparagus is absolutely unacceptable. There were so much fibre to it that I can't even cut it by knife- tomato on bread - was fine but seriously? After a tiny piece of churizo and a pinky size fried thing all you give is a few pieces of bread?!All in all, I scratch my head how the Michelin star came abouts. Food quality was not up there, food combo and serving was unacceptable, lastly, and the thing I cared least about, but thought I'd comment anyway, the staffs are not exactly polite. Rude even is say.Will I come back again? Absolutely not. Can I advocate for it? Absolutely not. Again, I disclaim that I went as a tour. But if the budget does not allow you to service decent human portioned food. Don't do it. Don't distort your brand name for that little bit of money. For such bad judgement, the shop still can't blame anyone. I think the single cube of chorizo really got me. What were they thinking...",
