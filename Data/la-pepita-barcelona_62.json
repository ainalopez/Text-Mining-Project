    "Great tapas place! It was close to our hotel and the metro to head out afterward. We did go during summer, so it was pretty damn hot inside, but it was super tasty. Loved the sea bass with strawberry and balsalmic. If you aren't into seafood the ham croquettes and the argentinian steak skewers were amazing. Papas bravas and tomato bread-a Barcelona staple you must have.",
