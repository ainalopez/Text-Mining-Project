    "This place is very touristy alright? I was reluctant to come here but my dining companion really wanted some paella and this place popped up. We went and tried their green peppers, anchovies, baby squid and seafood paella. Everything was well cooked and rather tasty but I really really wish they went lighter on salt in the paella. Waiter spoke great English and was really friendly.",
