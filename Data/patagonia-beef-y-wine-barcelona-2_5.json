    "About average for the price you pay. The service was fantastic and the food was good but you certainly pay for it. An average sized Argentinian rib eye or tenderloin for one will run you more than 30\u20ac. I highly recommend getting the Argentinian sausage as an appetizer. That was by far the best part of the meal. The chimichurri was delicious and definitely added another level of flavor to the meats. Great selection of wine and the interior is very classy and well decorated. We really wanted to eat at the highly praised Argentinian steakhouse Parrilla Alfonsina but reservations were completely booked for the night. We had to settle on Patagonia but still had an overall enjoyable meal.",
