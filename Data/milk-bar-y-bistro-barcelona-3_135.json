    "Nice quiet atmosphere, good service, the kind of place I'd be happy to bring friends.We came here for a quick drink and a late dinner on a jetlagged wander from 'somewhere' to 'home, I think'. We were surprised to find fish and chips on the menu, but they were just what we were looking for after all the rain. The nice thing is that its on a corner, so it isnt the usual cave that most bars in this area are.",
