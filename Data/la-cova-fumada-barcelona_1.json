    "Great time there for this place that looked nice on Yelp and truly lived up to its reputation. It opens late and was almost packed 15-20 minutes later. We managed to get a table next to the kitchen and man we loved it. It is a family runned place, the mother is there, the son... It gives a real good feel to it. Staff was extremely friendly. They gave us recommendations straight away and we went with a selection of dishes ranging from shrimp to garlic bread, octopus, bomba (! Must try!!) and I am forgetting some. Everything was fresh, very tasty, a tiny bit greasy especially for the shrimps but God it was good. Meals are balanced between traditional and decadent and I really want to go back and try the rest of the menu. I don't think you can be disappointed there honestly. Just think of a local kitchen, with plenty of good stuff to eat. I especially loved the look of it, very rustic yet very lively.",
