    "A great find on Yelp. \u00a0It was confirmed by locals as one of the best. \u00a0An unpretentious place decor with a sushi counter and decent amount of seating. \u00a0The sushi was quite good considering \u00a0I'm spoiled coming from the San Francisco bay area with excellent Japanese food. So, this is a nice find in Barcelona and I definitely look forward to coming back to Kibuka.",
