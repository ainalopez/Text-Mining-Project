    "If you like variety and finger food you will love this place. Wonderful staff. Bar better than the restaurant where the food was very rich. The cider and the basque wine were sharp, but that was a blessing when it came to the dishes we ordered. Fried Cod Tongues, followed by lamb knuckles with thousands of bones (ok, well not thousands, but lots) and a black pudding. Tender roast pork with crackling. I got the impression that the other dinners were having a similar \"rich\" experience. I ate everything but it was too much for me.We went back the next day for lunch. Standing room only at the bar where you can choose whatever you would like from a variety of dishes, keep the cocktail sticks, add them up and pay for the number of snacks you ate. Cold dishes at the bar and the staff bring around the hots ones. Pintxos! Simple. The quality of each was excellent and very affordable. Excellent stuff.",
