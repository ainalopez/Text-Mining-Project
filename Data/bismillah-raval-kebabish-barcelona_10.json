    "Great place!!The best Chicken Tikka I've ever had in Europe (and trust me I've tried many places). Very surprising considering 1where it's located 2the kind of restaurant.I had chicken Tikka (4/5pieces of masala grilled chicken breast) w 1 naan(white flour oven baked bread) for 4,6eur?Doubtful? Well kitchen is opened, and you can see that traditional Indian oven where the naan bread is freshly made quasi in front of you.It's an muslim indian restaurant/kebab place, so there are other multiple halal dishes (falafel and grab-and-go kebab)Staff is friendly and manager speaks English.A street where tourists usually won't go but if you're on a tight budget and want good affordable food, I highly recommend this one!Cheers",
