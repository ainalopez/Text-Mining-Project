    "We were told by a local guy who knows all these beautiful places for tapas. We ate a lot but each spent only 10 euros including drinks and services. But most importantly the tapas here were very delicious! I specially love the ones with salmon and avocado or baked mushrooms. One tip is to start slowly for the early rounds bcz they are keeping serving new selections of tapas.",
