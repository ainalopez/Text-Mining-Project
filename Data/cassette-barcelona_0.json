    "All my husband really wanted was a nice cocktail after drinking beer, wine and cappuccinos all week (not that it's an issue)......and after making a few turns at an attempt to go down an unchartered street, we stumbled upon this gem. After browsing their drink list we decided on an old fashioned and their version of a Moscow Mule. The young lady behind the bar took her time and really put to use some classic cocktail techniques and crafted our drinks. The mule had freshly shaven ginger, a cucumber flower and used ginger ale in place of the standard ginger beer. The best - you must order this. The old fashioned was absolutely perfect, was stirred just the way my husband likes it and garnished with orange peel and few house made cherries. A truly perfect little spot. I recommend it to anyone visiting the area. Plus they play amazing classic hip hop, wu-tang and beastie boys included.",
