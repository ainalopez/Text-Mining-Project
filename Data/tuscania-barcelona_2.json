    "The meatballs were dry out of the freezer. The lasagna was definitely 3 days old at least. One of the worst paellas I've had...rice was undercooked, meat was overlooked, the shrimp was the size of a fingernail. All in all, not a good experience. Go to the rambla for better food. If ur hella hungry and impatient like I was, just suck it up and to somewhere else.",
