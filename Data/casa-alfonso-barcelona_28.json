    "This is an unsung hero of mine.Fantastic food at generous prices& brilliant to go to alone. This, asa woman is not usually as easy,but here it was a warm & lovely experience.The ambience is wonderful, & it isso easy to see why it has attractedartists for years. Nowadays you mighteven catch a glimpse of Javier Bardemor Carmen Maura off set from filming.Or one of the monthly exhibitions heldthere. At lunch it is purely Catalan customersin the know - or the tourist who isn't yetaware of the treat in store for him.The popular dishes are the jamon iberica,which hangs there, chistorias al vino (chorizo sausages in Rioja - my favourite) or pisto Manchego (ratatouille) with a glass ofred wine: heaven!",
