    "This is a stupid man's idea of what a fancy Barcelona restaurant should be. Beware: the sangria is flat and tasteless, the bread is burnt, the salads are skimpy and have no flavor. The seafood paella was burnt worse than the bread and way too salty. My son's fish, the Hake, was disgustingly not fresh. The restaurant pretends to be a high class venue -- waiters in jackets and ties, nice chandeliers and wall coverings -- but the food can't be saved by the decor. If you love wasting your money and time to act chichi, then so be it. All I wish for is that someone would take over this nice location and use it for the good of mankind.",
