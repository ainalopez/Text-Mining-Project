    "We went following a recommendation of a friend. There were just the two of us, so even though there were groups of people waitng, we go seated by the carrousel immediately. We were very happy with the food. We didn't go looking for authenticity, just some tasty food and good atmosphere. We got both, plus good, fast and friendly service, all for a good price. There was a selection of sushi with some tasty sauces on top, good dumplings and chicken/pork on skewers. Fried shrimp was pretty good, too.",
