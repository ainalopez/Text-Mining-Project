    "I took my family here for the decor but I forgot that with the cutesy decor comes small children. \u00a0If you don't mind that, read on. \u00a0We were greeted happily when we walked in and made to feel welcome. \u00a0The servers do not speak English well so if you have specifics to your order, they may get lost in translation. \u00a0Other than that, the food was delicious and satisfying. \u00a0I had the pancakes that have bacon on them and left quite full! \u00a0A good meal!",
