    "My goal when traveling is to eat as many tasty things as possible, because calories on vacation don't count. Lolea was our first dinner when arriving in Barcelona. It was so ideal we returned for our last dinner in this amazing city. No meal truly met the expectations we had set here. To the outstanding cheese board, steak tartar, cockles, pear pesto ravioli to the final bite of carrot cake. All accompanied by light and refreshing in house sangrias. Our return night ended in ransacking of their daily menu which, once again, blew my mind. This place does pasta to perfection, and I'm saying that after a week in Italy!The service is what really brought us back again. We felt welcomed and wanted in this establishment and the servers were patient to help describe dishes in more detail. I will be pointing people down this ally in the future and hope to return some day!",
