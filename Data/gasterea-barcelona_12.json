    "Amazing place filed with locals. \u00a0Friendly staff and quick service. \u00a0Tapas are 1,9 euro each. Size is about 3 or 4 bites. Everything is great. \u00a0Try the flank steak casserole. 5,5 euro, \u00a0a bit bigger than the tapas. Finish with the goat cheese and sweet potato. \u00a09 tapas, 2 casseroles and a bottle of wine 45 euro. \u00a0Go.",
