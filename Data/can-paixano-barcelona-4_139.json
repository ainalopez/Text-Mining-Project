    "Of course, it's become a tourist trap over the last years. But Barcelona's most loudest, dirtiest, crowdedst and \u00a0to put it in one word: best \u00a0Xampa\u00f1er\u00eda is still called Xampa\u00f1er\u00eda Can Paixano and really is the best. There is other Xampa\u00f1er\u00edas, true: not such a wild crowd, a more relaxed atmosphere, better food. But you care only so much when, randomly passing Carrer de la Reina Cristina in the evening, you see the lively masses enjoying an abundance of Cava and Bocadillos. You can't escape. The champagne stand is nested between all sorts of Radio- and other shacks in Barceloneta, right by the port. But not only tourists find their way here, there's also lots of locals and students enjoying a nice after work cava after a hard day's work or exhausting lectures at the uni. Along with the tasty Bocadillos, the ruby red Cava is served \u00a0it used to be by the (cheap) bottle, but that got out of hand pretty soon. Now, with a glass of Cava, you have to eat something. But once you ordered a Bocadillo, you can just go and order more and more glasses of Cava (Rosado). Usually, there's a lot of meaningful gestures involved, not so much talk. The Bocadillos usually consist of rolls stuffed with Serrano ham, fish or greasy, mouthwatering sausages and steaks from the grill. You can't really go wrong, just order any of the hot (calents) or cold (freds) sandwiches (entrepans). Not too much needs to be said about the Rosado: In two, you can easily do 2-3 bottles within an hour. But you should bring an emtpy stomach, otherwise you won't get as many Bocadillos in as you require given the consumption of alcohol. It's a one of a kind experience \u00a0but then again, not: You'll be back, and that's a promise.",
