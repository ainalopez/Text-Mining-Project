    "This place is a Tourist trap with worse food than what you would find at a rest stop at the side of a highway. We should have known it would be bad given that it is directly across from Sagrada Familia but the decor looked nicer than the surrounding restaurants so we gave it a try. The pizza was on par with a frozen pizza that got microwaved. We ordered two other tapas that were equally as disappointing. The only positives were that the restaurant ambiance was decent, there was free wifi, and the service was quick and attentive.",
