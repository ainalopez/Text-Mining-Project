    "Had an amazing breakfast here! Food is gourmet and vegan-friendly. All the vegan items are clearly marked. However, they seem to think honey is vegan, which I disagree with. Honey is not vegan, just like cow milk is not vegan. My husband and I ordered:Toast with avocado, olive oil, and hot spicesVegan snow flake cakeSoy yogurt with blueberry and granolaWhole wheat croissant with margarine and jamAll were delicious!",
