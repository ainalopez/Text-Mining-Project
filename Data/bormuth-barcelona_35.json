    "This place is a must-visit if you're in the born area. There is a lively crowd, it's constantly packed, and if you're lucky enough to get one of the outside seats, then you are at a double advantage because you can both people watch on the street & watch people inside the restaurant. I had the chorizo and it was incredible. I also had the sangria and vermouth and they were \u00a0divine. Ps No shortage of men with manbuns (my favorite). The best part is that when I was telling the staff here that they had five stars on yelp, they had no idea what yelp was.",
