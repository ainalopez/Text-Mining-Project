    "Best food and service of my life... (So far)I did not have the tasting menu as my partner was worried would not be enough food. We went \u00e0 la cart the staff recommended dividing up some of the courses between us, so we split our main courses half each... I have eaten at some great places, this is the BEST, so far it's not cheep but this is a special place your not going to go every week or every month... However the next time I an in Barcelona I know where I am going...THANKYOU",
