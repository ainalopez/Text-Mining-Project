    "This restaurant is lovely - it relaxed us even after we got lost walking there AND got caught in a thunderstorm (sans umbrella, of course) and were soaked to the bone when we walked in the door. \u00a0The wine and food were both very good (we opted for the chef's tasting menu), though perhaps more traditional and less inventive than at some other high end Barcelona restaurants. \u00a0My favorite dishes were an entree with monkfish and clams with a sherry reduction, and a parfait-like dessert with coconut and mango. \u00a0A nice dinner to start our visit!",
