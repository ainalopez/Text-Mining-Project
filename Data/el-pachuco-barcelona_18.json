    "Having grown up in California and travelled to Mexico I've eaten a lot of Mexican food and all I can say is El Pachuco one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever tried. Great food, super friendly chef/owner and really cozy atmosphere. Prices are low and the beer is cold, can't ask for more. If you fo ask for more, ask for a Michelada you'll like it.",
