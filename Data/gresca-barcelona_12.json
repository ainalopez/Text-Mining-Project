    "Amazing.There is truly magic to be experienced at this restaurant. \u00a0From beginning to end, we were mesmerized by how common, \"low-brow\" ingredients were transformed into beguiling and decadent dishes that evoked memories of top tier dining in NYC. \u00a0Amongst the foie and sweetbreads were equally amazing courses of cod fish, pigeon \u00a0and omelettes with pork belly that were all skillfully coaxed to reach comparable heights of flavour. \u00a0All the food was so amazingly delicious that it was no surprise when we learned that our turbot that night had literally come to the kitchen straight off a boat that had returned that afternoon.The desserts were not only delicious but displays of playfulness and creativity. \u00a0The \"pina colada\" was a shell sprayed with chocolate to make it look like a coconut shell, whose insides were coated with a frozen coconut meringue and filled with white rum pineapple juice (yes, it tasted just as amazing as it sounds). \u00a0The black current sorbet was presented in a gravity-defying form (how does a sliver of sorbet hold itself up like a sheet of plastic?), thanks to some ingenious machinations of the chef that I would be unfair for me to disclose here.This was truly an experience to be had, and a true realization of the chef's philosophy that you don't need expensive and precious ingredients to achieve gastronomic brilliance, but just the best of the simple things of life coupled with a little bit of mind-bending ingenuity and creativity.",
