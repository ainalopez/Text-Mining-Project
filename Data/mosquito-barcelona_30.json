    "Probably one of the better meals I had in Spain, especially for the price. \u00a0They have a great beer list, which is something that I generally struggled to find in Spain (you can only drink so much macro-brewed Estella before you're ready for real beer.) \u00a0I honestly don't recall anything that I didn't enjoy, and when I talk to my friends about our trip, it often comes back to \"hey, remember that one little place serving dim sum in those narrow streets?\" \u00a0I'd love to come back for sure!",
