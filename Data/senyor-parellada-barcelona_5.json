    "Don't let the fancy looks of this place fool ya - the menu (and the price) was a lot more approachable. \u00a0Once you figure out that the menu is translated in several languages, zoom in on what looks good from the starters and the main entr\u00e9e sections. \u00a0We opted for Mediterranean mussels and a refreshing salad of octopus and greens. \u00a0Both of these were good and the salad, in particular, is something I would most likely try to make at home. \u00a0Unfortunately, neither of the main entrees were executed as successfully with the paella being just mediocre and my fillet of dorado had more bones than I was willing to pick out (it's a good thing I'm quite patient with this task). \u00a0Because it's a fancier looking place and situated next to a hotel, it had a lot of international guests that I felt overwhelmed the servers. \u00a0They were not rude - they were simply understaffed. \u00a0I might recommend other eateries in the area and with this being located in Born - you will surely find one!",
