    "We are visiting from Los Angeles and had a late dinner here. The people were wonderful and the food, even better. We shared several meals family style, and enjoyed all of them.The desserts were outstanding, and at the end, we were all fighting over the carrot cake and the Leche Marengada. Prices are reasonable. I highly recommend it, and can't wait to come back.",
