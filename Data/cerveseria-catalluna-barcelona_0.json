    "If you are a Beer lover as I am you are looking forward to find a place like this. They have a huge selection of craft beers, most of them locally produce. I love IPA, and they are difficult to find in normal Bars. In catalluna they have an incredible selection (I loved Ibuprofano), and the staff commanded by Quim is kind and pro-active suggesting you new arrivals and the best of the best. And on top of it they serve some peanuts and roasted corn with the beer. A must in Gracia!",
