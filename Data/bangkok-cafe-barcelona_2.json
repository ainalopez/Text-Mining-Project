    "My husband and I decided to go here because this place had the most rating. It was hard to find since it was in a dark alley and the restaurant barely lit up. They barely speak English but was able to accommodate us. The menu was limited and we did not have an option to decrease the spicy level. The thing that I hated most was that they don't serve noodles, only rice. Not your traditional or typical Thai restaurant. If I had known these facts, I wouldn't have gone here.",
