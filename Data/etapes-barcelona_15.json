    "Small restaurant with excellent food and excellent service. \u00a0If you want to make a reservation their website has an email address and they were very responsive. \u00a0Their english is also good. \u00a0Huge wine selection. \u00a0I would simply do the 60 euro tasting menu and add the wine pairings if I could go again. \u00a0We ordered a bunch of appetizers and the paella. \u00a0All the appetizers were great, the paella however was not so good - strong burned taste to it. \u00a0But then I feel like it's on the menu only because they feel the have to. \u00a0Avoid the paella. \u00a0However everything else was so good that I feel like it deserves 5 stars despite this. \u00a0For the quality of food it's also very good value.",
