    "A-mazing!!!! Hands down the best place in town! It was so good that we had to come a second time! The staff is so nice and they really take the time to describe each bottle of wine. But even more impressive than their natural wine - which is apparently a step up from organic - is the food! We had smoked tuna, olives, autumn salad, smoked sardines, roasted pumpkin, steamed mussels and clams, and burrata cheese with tomatoes and basil. Everything was divine!!!! Interestingly the vegetarian dishes were my favorites. If you have to pick one thing on the menu, I recommend the buratta! It melts in your mouth! We ate it so fast that I forgot to take a photo. A close second was the roasted pumpkin. The place itself is very casual and has a hip atmosphere. But you must make a reservation if you want to have dinner there. You won't need one for lunch. This is THE place to go in Barcelona!",
