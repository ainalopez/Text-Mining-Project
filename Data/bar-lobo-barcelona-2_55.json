    "Really hot day and tired on our second to last day in Barcelona. Walking up and down La Ramblas and not finding anything except for tapas and paella. Frankly we wanted something different for dinner. Happened onto Bar Lobo and there were many open tables and the menu looked great. So we decided to have dinner here out of desperation. WOW! What a great dinner we had. We ordered duck breast (perfectly cooked) \u00a0Lobo burgers, Spanish tomatoes (very fresh) and spinach blue cheese salad. ALL great and delicious! So good we went back the next night as well. Ordered the mussels in cream sauce, \u00a0 meatballs and squid, rigatoni pasta and veal sirloin. Pasta portion was a bit small but very tasty. Veal was excellent. Their French fries are fantastic! Was not disappointed. The sangria was very nice and refreshing! My wife and I polished off the one liter pitcher. The wait staff spoke English well enough to not leave us guessing. Very prompt and courteous. A well run establishment. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service. About \u20ac70 to \u20ac80 for a family of four. Come early to avoid the rush. We arrived at around 7:00 pm and were seated immediately. By 8:00 there was a line out the door. But folks just went to the bar for drinks first. I don't think they had to wait too long as they set up more tables outside. We sat inside for the air conditioning. I would come back here again when we return to Spain!",
