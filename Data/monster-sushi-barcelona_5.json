    "Came here after several recommendations online, as my previous sushi experiences in BCN have been far from memorable. Friendly and attentive waitstaff sat and attended to our order throughout the meal. We came around 8pm and most of the tables were apparently reserved, but we got lucky with one open table on the patio. Especially on the weekends it is advised to visit their website and place a reservation in advance.Ordered the 6x4 Combination Plate, which was about 6 different rolls/8 pieces each and the Tiger Roll which I split with a friend and both were awesome. I couldnt tell you the name of each roll or what was on it necessarily but they were all enjoyable and definitely the most unique sushi I've ever eaten. Good balance of flavors that emphasized the taste of the fish and was not necessarily overwhelming in any of its aspects. Was approximately about 24E each and was not insanely expensive for good sushi. I was considered as to the portion sizes because I can usually eat my weight in sushi but for the quality as well as quantity I left the table comfortably full. But of course could have eaten another plate or two.",
