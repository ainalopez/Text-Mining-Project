    "Service and ambiance was great, but the food was disappointing. I put Tapeo on my must eat list while in Barcelona after researching best tapas spots online; however every dish we ordered whether it was fried or grilled (usually fried) was either salty or bland. We had the rabbit ribs, roasted chicken, and stuffed squid - all highly recommended on Yelp. The result, unfortunately was sub par. Also, the only folks in here were English speaking tourists, people just like me. I really wanted to like this place but I'm sorry to say the dishes don't come anywhere close to good tapas.",
