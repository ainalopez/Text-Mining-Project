    "A great restaurant hiding in the middle of Barcelona.The 5 course menu is excellent... Corn yogurt, lamb, salmon, soup, dessert, etc.My favorite dish was the salmon which can also be requested on its own (ie outside the fixed menu).The wine list is limited with some wines not available.Last but not least... Excellent kitchen :)!!!",
