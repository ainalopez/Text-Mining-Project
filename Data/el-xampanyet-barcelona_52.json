    "Wandering the streets of Barcelona will allow you to stumble upon hidden gems. For my buddy it was the Picasso museum and for me it was this place. I am not really into strolling around in silence and looking at some dead guy's \"masterpieces\" so I stumbled into El Xampanyet to drink and nibble.The tapas are on clear display and you can't help but to dive right in. The friendly faces behind the stand up bar poured me a beer from the tap which was covered in ice and the sampling began. Tuna, anchovies, sardines, olives, and mussels. All were outstanding and really affordable. The second generation owner was in the building and chatted me up a bit a gave me a stellar suggestion of where to grub on the best paella in Barcelona.Apparently this place has been around for almost 100 years and it's sure to be around for 100 more. A return trip is in the works for Barcelona and El Xampanyet is at the top of the list for a quick beer and a bite!",
