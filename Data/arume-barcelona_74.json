    "For some reason, our non english speaking cab drive would not take us to this recommended restaurant. The next cabbie, said the reason is that it is located in the most dangerous part of town. We went anyways and were glad we did. The service and food was excellent, and the owner came by and spent some time with us, talking about the place. Be sure you have them get you a cab when you are done. I don't know what the hoopla was about the location, as when we left it looked as normal as any part of the city",
