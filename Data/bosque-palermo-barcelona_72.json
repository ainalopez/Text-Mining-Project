    "The seafood paella here is AMAZING. The saffrony tomato sauce and rice are perfectly caramelized at the bottom while rich, steaming and thick at the top. The seafood is cooked to perfection and if this dish was available in the states, I'd probably eat it everyday... for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The only downside was the service. The guy who seated us and waited on us (an oldish man with white hair) was impatient, rude and made us wait for 30mins before taking our order even though the restaurant wasn't busy when we went (around midnight on a weekday). The other food on the menu such as the breaded pork dishes and the steak aren't all that appetizing and more greasy than tasty but the only reason I can think of that anyone would visit this place is for the paella! So if you ever find yourself in Barcelona, come here for the best paella dish of your life :)",
