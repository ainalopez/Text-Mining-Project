    "Top marks for the tuna belly and sea cucumber tapas! Can't begin to describe how sublime both dishes were. The tuna belly had a soft, luscious texture and smokiness to it while the sea cucumber had a magnificent crunchinrss to it and was accompanied by a flavorful sauce. What a night to remember!",
