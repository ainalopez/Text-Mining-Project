    "Bought a groupon so ended up paying around 40 for 2 people. The music was good - he guitarist and drummer were fantastic and the lead singer had an amazing voice. The first tapas (bread with cured meat and cheese) was amazing, and the other ones (calamari, ham croquette) were not as good. The drink service was great. It wasn't very busy so maybe that's why we were so well taken care of. Overall I would recommend - if you have a deal. Also - don't forget to call ahead if you want to eat beforehand.",
