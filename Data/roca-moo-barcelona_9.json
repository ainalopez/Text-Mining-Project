    "The dining room is beautiful and spacious. The menu is fun, imaginative and expertly plated. My husband's seasonal tasting menu with wine pairing was perfect. Unfortunately my experience was not good. My starter omelette with mushrooms and white Catalan sausage was divine. My cod entree was raw, which I wasn't expecting. Be prepared to be snubbed if you do not order the suggested wine pairings. I had trouble getting the wait staff's attention and wasn't checked on during dinner AT ALL! The attitude of the sommelier and waiter soured my experience. Save your 180\u20ac and eat anywhere else.",
