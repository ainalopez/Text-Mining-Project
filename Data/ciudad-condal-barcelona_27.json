    "Of all the tapas restaurants we dined at in Barcelona, this one is my favorite! Even a dish as simple as tomato bread was so well executed. The crunchy exterior with fresh tomato and olive oil on top... I would gladly eat a plate of that again. Notable dishes include the razor clams, beef tenderloin, and the prawn skewers. The girlfriends and I tried both the red and white sangrias. The white one was like juice, but potent. The group liked the white over the red, but both were very good. Our server was nice and so funny! We tried to dine there again for lunch the next day, but there was a 45 min wait (which is typical), and unfortunately, we just didn't have the time. Highly recommend!",
