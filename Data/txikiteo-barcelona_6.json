    "Fantastic food, english menu available, some english skills. I had the potato and Catalian sausage starter. It was a rich beef broth with peppers potatoes, and sausage. For a main, ox tails. In red wine. \u00a0Fantastic. Marilyn had e cod in tomato sauce. She ALS raised about it.For desert the chocolate torte very good, but would have been better warm. Location is very close to the Desenses metro stop at the end of the Rambia.Came here for a repeat, \u00a0food still fantastic. \u00a0However the service really sucked this time. \u00a0Skipped deserts (postatdes) this time as the waiter never checked back.",
