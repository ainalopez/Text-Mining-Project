    "This was a place my cousin & I truly enjoyed. Before her flight back to the US, we went here for breakfast early on a Sunday morning. We ordered eggs, a kir royale & a mimosa (watched the bartender make them). I also ordered a coffee after my meal - as expected, it was fab.They were playing indie rock - inside, it was rather dark (which I liked), & the place felt more like a hipster bar (with angel wings hanging right above the bar) somewhere in the US, than a breakfast joint in Barcelona. I really liked the ambiance - I'm not a morning person. It was just cool how it wasn't your run-of-the-mill 'sunny' breakfast joint.My order (I forget what it was, salmon & eggs I think) was quite tasty. It was definitely 1 of my more memorable Barcelona meals.My cousin liked that our server spoke English fluently (not that that's something I personally expect - as the visitor, *I* ought to learn their language), & was really, really nice.I can't remember the prices, but I remember thinking they were reasonable. I'd definitely recommend Milk for breakfast in Barcelona :D",
