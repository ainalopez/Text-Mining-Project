    "The best tapas we had in Barcelona!! It is a little more pricey compared with other places but at least you know you'll be getting a phenomenal meal!The favorite- mussels in red curry!!! Seriously smack your mama good! I could've eaten a bucket of these things!- Flank steak cooked perfectly with a sauce that tasted of truffle- Tuna was seared perfectly but wish there was more- buratta with tomato YUM! - Both pasta dishes we great (half portion was enough) but the truffle pasta was the best! - mushroom crema dish was good because I love mushrooms but the other 3 in the group didn't enjoy it. It had egg, mushrooms and cream with a br\u00fbl\u00e9e top so it was slightly sweet. Shout out to the wait staff who are incredibly attentive and helpful as well!Reservation is recommended",
