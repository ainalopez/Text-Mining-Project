    "We were rcommended this place by our hotel staff. We were not disappointed. We arrived Monday night at 8:00 and it was empty. We were told they could seat us but we had to be out by 10:00. Not a problem.We ordered the Catalan Tomato bread, which was awesome. Well worth the extra \u20ac0.50. Then we had chicken croquettes, another excellent selection . Finally we shared the risotto and seafood chowder. We didnt care for the chowder but the Risotto was delicious if a little oily. The Sangria was dynamite!Service was so-so and we waited about 25 minutes for our bill, but not the end of he world.Special bonus for having menus in English, Catalan & Spanish.",
