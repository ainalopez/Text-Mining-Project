    "Stepped in on a quiet night to shake off the jet lag, and was thoroughly surprised by the craftsmanship of this place. \u00a0I could imagine this place in London, NYC, LA, or SF, but never imaged running into a place like this in a quiet residential street in Barcelona. \u00a0This place has a nice vibe about it, they have plenty top notice gin and the bartenders know how to knockout cocktails with it too.Tip: If you are going to drop 10 Euro on top shelf gin, go for the Fever Tree tonic so you can really savor the gin.This place was so good I sat a couple of seats down from Bobby Flay when he was in town.",
