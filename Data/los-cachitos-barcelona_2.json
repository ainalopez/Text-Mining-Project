    "Corner caf\u00e9/tapas bar. Typical place for food and drinks. Inside is a bit small and can be quite smoky. Outside is nice, though, and the seated area on the pavement is at the intersection of a few streets, making it a decent place to people-watch. They do a nice croissant and coffee for breakfast.",
