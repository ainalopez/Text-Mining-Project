    "This is the place to be in La Boqueria market. Recommended to me by foodies, it did not disappoint, but you certainly arent the only one who knows about this place! If you find a seat grab it! Much easier if you're alone... This is a perfect place for you if you're travelling solo.They serve a traditonal workers breakfast, but theyre open all day. Grab an english menu and you just mark on the menu you have what you want. Give it to the guys, order your drink verbally. Enjoy. Its great. Really great. Highly recommend the eggs with mushrooms. But really everything is good!",
