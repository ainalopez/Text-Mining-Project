    "Good place. We take the 12 \u20ac menu, the salad it's good, the pan con tomate was cold I think they can invest time in grilling the bread at the moment could be much better, the paella was very nice and made at the moment!!! But my suggestion it's eat inside because the weather get the food cold just in a few minutes, but it's not the problem of the restaurant !",
