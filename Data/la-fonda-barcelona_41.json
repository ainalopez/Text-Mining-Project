    "Went specifically for paella which was okay. \u00a0 Salads were fresh. \u00a0One entree forgotten and had to wait until most of the meal was done and asked wait staff for it. \u00a0While food was okay, the service was pretty sad. \u00a0Bad attitudes from both staff members. \u00a0Food served but offered no help in pouring water or making sure we all had silverware and napkins which we did not.",
