    "I found this place through Yelp and it did not disappoint. I went with a pretty big group (10+) and they were very accommodating, especially impressive since they're a pretty small restaurant. The neighborhood is pretty cool, would highly suggest walking around after. The food was awesome and not very expensive. The ultimate vehicle for salt, the iberico secreto, is a must have.",
