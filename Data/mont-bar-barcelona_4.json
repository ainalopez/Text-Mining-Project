    "This place is so good that I came here twice during my last trip to Barcelona, truly amazing food. I think me and my friends were able to try the whole menu during our two visits and everything from their ensaladilla rusa to the tuna belly and the super tender and tasty t-bone was perfect. It's not the cheapest tapas bar in the city, but it's also not the most expensive one either. The food they serve is really modern and all their dishes are well executed and has great quality ingredients. Just go there, you won't be disappointed.",
