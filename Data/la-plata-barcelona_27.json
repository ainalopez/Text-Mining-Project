    "I think the cost effectiveness overshadowed the deliciousness of La Plata. The food in my opinion was salty (in a good way) but lacking that 5 star punch of flavor that I had received at other tapas bars around towns. I thought the sardines were decent, the tomato bread was meh, and the wine could have been better.",
