    "One of the most memorable things I ate in Barcelona. Get a foie gras ham sandwich with two glasses of cava...at least. The line can be pretty long and inside can be SUPER packed. Drink fast or else someone might knock over your drink. Bottles are so cheap. Actually everything was really cheap! Be aggressive or else you'll never get anything to eat or drink. SO GOOD. I'm drooling thinking about it right now.",
