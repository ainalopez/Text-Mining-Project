    "Let's start with the good things. Well, Nomo is located in one of the prettiest streets in Barcelona, which explains the slight over-pricing of its menu. I liked the dessert. Very simple vanilla ice cream paired with a chocolate mousse dripping melted chocolate. I also appreciated the eel uramaki, even though kind of biased by the extreme hunger I faced it with.On the negative side, I found the service to be pretty cold towards the customers. Moreover, the first dish, which was included among the \"Suggestions\" of the chef, was a big disappointment. Five shrimps covered in a spicy sauce resembling pre-packaged salsa brava on top of a bed of fried little noodles that left me confused for a while.Overall decent experience. Nevertheless, if up for a sushi, I feel like suggesting Kibuka for the quality and Toyo for the price. Peace out legends!",
