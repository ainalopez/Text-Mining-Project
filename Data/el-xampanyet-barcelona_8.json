    "I was wandering in this area and spotted the name of this place. \u00a0I remembered in my travel book so I went directly in. \u00a0It was my first time in Spain, first time in Barcelona, first time eating tapas IN SPAIN. \u00a0I did not know what I was doing only knowing what I saw on travel/ food TV. \u00a0Uh hi, first time, what should I get?! \u00a0I stood at the counter and started pointing at things I must have - cava, jamon, artichokes, bacalao, red bell peppers, longostines! \u00a0Knowing how good it was looking back, I wish I had ordered more!! \u00a0This is definitely one to bookmark for the next time. \u00a0Getting the attention of the servers was a little challenging as they are very busy but you just have to step it up for what you want!",
