    "I was first introduced to this place by my vegan friend and have been a regular ever since! I've tried the burgers, the salad and the fries. All great! (And that's coming from a non-vegan) They even have vegan cheese you can ask to have melted on the fries. I've never eaten the desserts but I plan to! Good, economical place for those on diets as well! Salad is filling and very affordable!",
