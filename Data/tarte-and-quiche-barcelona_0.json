    "I stumbled upon this place and it was so good I came here twice in four days. For a little over 6 euro you get an amazing quiche (tomato and mozarella was great), a salad and a drink (I got a beer, no additional cost). Add two bucks and you get to try one of the deserts. Amazing selection and taste. Seriously, try it out. If you want just the quiche it's about 3.5 euro.",
