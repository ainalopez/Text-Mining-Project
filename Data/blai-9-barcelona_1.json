    "Pinchos (open faced sandwiches) are a tradition in Spain that originated in the Basque country. Like any food, these snacks have evolved over the years and you can now find toppings that range from more traditional tortilla and fish to more modern chicken wings and hamburger patties. The street that this restaurant is on (named Blai, of course) is frequented by mostly young locals, so it makes sense that most of the street's bars cater to them. Blai 9 is all the way on the modern end of the spectrum, and while they serve a few traditional pinchos, most of their dishes are big, beautiful, and very contemporary. The experience was very enjoyable, and the food was good (but not great). Beer was well priced (but there is cheaper), and service was very quick. If you find yourself in this part of Barcelona, head over to Blai 9 and give their modern twist on this old dish a try!",
