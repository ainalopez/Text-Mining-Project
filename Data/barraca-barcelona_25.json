    "Loved the environment and location on the beach. Staff was nice too. Started with the burrata salad which was great. Also ordered a sea food paella. It was delicious--very salty though. It was a pricier meal. They charged us for bread that we figured was complementary. Wine wasn't as cheap as at other restaurants here.The clientele last night appeared to be more sophisticated American tourists. Probably because everyone saw the review for it in the New York Times article on 36 hours at the beach in Barcelona.",
