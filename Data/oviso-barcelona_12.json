    "How can I not give this place 5 stars? \u00a0The manager, Eric, took great care of us, and the crowd was friendly. \u00a0Everyone seemed to be having a good time, and this spot clearly is a local favorite. \u00a0A short walk from La Rambla, Oviso is worth a visit when you're looking for a late night beer or snack.",
