    "Where Anthony Bourdain leads, I will follow. The official Carole King remix.This was my favorite place I ate in Barcelona. Simple ingredients, but combined into some incredibly tasty dishes.Tight space, but relatively easy to move around and find a corner to tuck into. The women behind the counter are impressive. Really attentive and grab your attention when your dishes are ready. If you're into happiness you'll be into this place.",
