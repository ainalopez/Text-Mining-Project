    "My wife and I are staying right near the Sports Bar and this has become our go to spot for a quick eat. \u00a0The Sports Bar pizza is really good (with cheese baked into the pizza crust). \u00a0We've also tried the lasagna and gnocchi and both have hit the spot.It's a little pricey (11.50 Euro for the Sports Bar Pizza), but this place totally fits the bill when you are sick of tapas and don't have 2 hours to spend on a sit down meal.",
