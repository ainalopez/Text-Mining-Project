    "Great little tapas venue. If room permits, sit at the bar.We ended up with a table in the back which was fine. The venue is nice with beautiful wood pieces.Service was nice. Our waitress was attentive and was a busy body. She ran around trying to keep everyone happy.The food and the prices were decent. Nothing extraordinary but I enjoyed the food with great company!",
