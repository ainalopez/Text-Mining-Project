    "This was such a great little restaurant. We went there on our first night in Barcelona during our trip. We had spent the afternoon exploring the Gothic Quarter, drinking in the architecture and letting our imagination run wild with images of life in old city. When it was finally dinner time, we discovered El Xampanyet just down the street from the Picasso Museum. It looked very crowded and lively from the outside, and luckily for us, a couple of seats had opened up at the bar.It's all about the tapas at this restaurant. We sat at the bar and ordered tapas after tapas. Everything was delicious. Not to mention, it seemed like they had a never-ending supply of their house cava. El Xampanyet is one restaurant I recommend everyone to dine at if they are visiting Barcelona. We'll definitely go back the next time we're in the city.",
