    "Excellent food in the Boqueria market. Well worth the wait. You'll find El Quim in the middle of Barcelona's Boqueria. There are only about a dozen bar stools for dining customers, and they are usually full. To wait your turn, you strategically choose diners to wait behind, and try and respect the other waiting customers that may have arrived before you. Once you are seated, you are given a menu in the language of your choosing- they have menus in English too! You check off what you want, and then wait for your food. We based our order off of what we had seen other customers eating. We had the seafood paella (not on the menu but they're making it nonstop), the patatas bravas, the croquetas of the day, and the tortilla of the day. All were delicious and highly recommended. Next time we would try the artichoke chips, the seasoned crawfish, and the clams- we saw many other diners enjoy these dishes. The staff here are very busy but very friendly.",
