    "So I'm an American so I've had a million hamburgers in my life. My wife and I both had the signature Bro burger. it comes with arugula lettuce tomatoes caramelized onions and bacon. On a white bun. It also has a creamy sauce with I believe has paprika in it. Didn't care for the sauce as much but then I don't even like mustard or ketchup on my burgers to be fair. So I wish I would of known about the sauce so I could ask not to have it. The beef patty is 200grams. Now that's almost a half pound beef patty! .44 pounds to be exact. So it's big. Over all it's a tasty burger for you to get your burger fix if you're missing it. We've been in Eastern Europe for the past month and half and they don't eat beef there; therefore I'm trying to get as much beef in while I'm in Spain before I have to go back to the cold eastern \"beefless\" Europe. It's worth the trip. Our burger was 6.50 euro apiece. We had a plate of nacho chips and guacamole also. It was good too for 4 euros. All in all. It's in a residential area not too far to walk from there beach or marina and the food and prices are better than the tourist traps. This is definitely a locals neighborhood restaurant. Are you serious? You're still reading and haven't already logged in to the map to navigate there? They have an English menu and the waiter spoke fluent English. Free wifi also. The password for the wifi is written on the wall above the entrance.Damn man get walking already.",
