    "Anchovies served brined or in vinegar were a good standard as expected everywhere in Spain. Tuna with a very mild chilli oil was dry but at least substantial. Bread with a sundried tomato, mild cheese, anchovy and olive topping had a lovely combination of flavours. Roasted marinated artichoke was surprisingly good with a unexpected soft char outside and a crunchy raw inside. Lastly a pastry filled with tuna & egg and topped with a dry red pepper and olive was average but certainly different.The only other options were cheese or jamon. I would recommend coming here for a drink and snack, but being aware that the range is limited and there is no hot food or any raciones.eatlikeushi.posthaven.co\u2026",
