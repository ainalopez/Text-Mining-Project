    "Was here with my family last sunday. I had a vegan pear and chocolate muffin and it was to die for!!! Yummy!My brother and I also shared a vegan bagel with tempeh, vegan cream cheese and cheese and it was very plain and boring.My sisters cappucino was so strong she was not able to drink it.I guess it's always nice to find vegan food but I ate better somewhere else.",
