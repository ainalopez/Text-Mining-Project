    "Seen many of those asian buffet places around the world, \u00a0but seldom have i seen this amount of choice in dishes to try. Overall atmosphere seems ok when you enter but soon becomes one of a school cafeteria with lines of tables. Staff could be a bit frienlier but service was not pushing for extra drinks after the first. No photos allowed, \u00a0so no party pics. Quality of food is decent but as all buffets not top quality meats. But with a price of 16 euro you get what you \u00a0pay for. Ready dishes, \u00a0cooked on the plancha your chosen raw ingredients and sushi for the mains and a choise of desserts and icecream. Would i go again? \u00a0Yes and no. \u00a0Alone no, but with a seafood lover for sure",
