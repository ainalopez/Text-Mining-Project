    "the setting is beautiful, by the sea, the restaurant appears clean, the waiters are attentive, the Paella is acceptable, however our bill was 'boosted' @ 20% for items we didn't order and were charged for (5 slices of bread fo 9.75 Euros!, charged for 2 salad and ordered 1, 5 Euros for watered down sangria). \u00a0Not a good value to be sure. If you go- check the bill carefully. \u00a0Oh yes, we got complimentary cakes and a sweet undrinkable liquor- perhaps to distract us from examining the bill. Beware.",
