    "Excellent tasting food. \u00a0Offers an English menu that you check the box for the you want. \u00a0French fries are fresh cut, taste amazing, and come in a bowl with enough for 2 people! \u00a0Burger was delicious. \u00a0The chicken burger was tasty, but for me the sauce on top was sweet and overpowered the chicken.",
