    "My boyfriend and I spent two weeks in Barcelona and came to this place three times. \u00a0Had we discovered it sooner, we would have visited more. The food is fresh, simple and delicious. Each visit we would order one pizza, one pasta, one starter and a bottle wine. We couldn't decide if we liked the pasta or pizza better. The price was amazing for what you get. The restaurant is staffed by one person. He takes your order and then cooks it. He is very friendly. We'll miss this place!",
