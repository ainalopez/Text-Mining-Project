    "This is a very small bar/restaurant that is a favorite amongst locals. It really is a hole in a wall but is buzzing every night. We got there on a fairly early night but the bar was packed and all the tables as well. It was overwhelming because you didn't know who to talk to. We got our name down with one of the servers who was very pleasant and was happy to help us. Got a drink from bar and waited about 30 min until a couple decided they had their fill and finally a table with our name on it.They are known for their house made vermouth so ordered a glass while we looked over their wine list. The wine list was so inexpensive, so many to choose from. I thought the prices were by glass but it was for a bottle! Vermouth was a great starter, ordered a bottle of red, their famous potatoes, a seafood combo, pan con tomate, and a cured pork toast. Everything was delicious and definitely worth the wait. Thank you Bar Bodega Quimet, hope to come back soon!",
