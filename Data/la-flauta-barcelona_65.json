    "We sat at the bar top both times, that's right, twice! As many places as Barcelona has to offer this is one of the best modern tapas places, gastronomy that actually works. Our bartender/server who looked like and sounded like Javier Bardem was friendly, quick, gracious, and helpful. He made great recommendations which I have listed below.Mini Hamburguesa- tiny flavorful hamburgers, sliders at their bestMontadito de SolomiMont CammemberMontadito Gambas- Juicy plump shrimpMontadito Foie- Foie paired with sweet cherry Jarra EstrellaHuevos Cabreados- Egg something, all I remember is that I like it alotEnsalada de Pasta- Refreshing pasta saladPostresEverything we ordered was fantastic and prices were decent considering the quality of food and work that went into creating each dish.",
