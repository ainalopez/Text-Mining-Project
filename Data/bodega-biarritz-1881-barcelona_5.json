    "Incredible tapas. The ambiance of the restaurant is super cool & it has a great feel for being so small. The food was fresh, the employees are very entertaining & speak different languages which is helpful to those who don't speak Spanish. We went at 8:00 pm on a Friday night & only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Once you get inside you don't feel rushed at all or as if they're trying to get customers in & out even though there's a line. I would 100% recommend eating here!",
