    "Stopped by late at night for a late snack. The young lady at the counter went out of her way to explain the food to us in English. We wanted items for take away and she was creative at finding an appropriate container for us. When we asked about utensils, one of the gentlemen workers went out of his way to find some plastic utensils. The decor was cute. Tried the potato tortilla item and it was very tasty.",
