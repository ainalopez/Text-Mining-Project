    "Finally I am able to compare the Wok to Walk in Valencia to the one in Barcelona. And I definitely can say: the Wok to Walk in BNC is as good and tasty as its sister (or brother) in Valencia.What I really like about this one here is that we actually were served at the table, once our delicious food was ready...we did not have to wait long....1 2 3 and it was done!Fresh ingredients, new options on the menu, attentive staff, perfect lunch!Wok to Walk as I know it, thanks for not letting me down, Barcelona!",
