    "To my first dinner spot in Barcelona with the wifey and I got to say its one of the best. The food was good. We just did their tapas and it was good. It just might be that we were hungry but I love the you pick your own food (literally) process. \u00a0The servers were very helpful and tried to recommend some of the other tapas we were able to reach for (there are other customers sitting in from of their tapa plates so you got to ask nicely...). I felt more comfortable here than at la flauta II(in my previous review on a place in Barcelona). Will be a place to come back to with a group of friends drinking wine and socializing...if we don't find another super duper place in Barcelona.",
