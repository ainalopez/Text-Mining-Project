    "My husband and I came after reading the Yelp reviews and this restaurant is amazing. We got the potato omelette, croquettes, and two pastrami sandwiches (American and Diablo). The pastrami here is special because the owner gets the pastrami right next door, which is the shop that supplies pastrami to all of Spain. So, yes. Special. What's also great is the owner - super friendly and really cares about the food and how each person enjoys it. Highly recommended. Go.",
