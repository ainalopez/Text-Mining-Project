    "So I decided to bump up my national U.S. steakhouse tour and take it international. Amidst all the tapas and other culinary selections in Barcelona, I decided to grab a steak. A ribeye to be exact (surprise, surprise).Overall, I'd give the meal 3 stars. I've become accustomed to more marbling in my ribeye; this Argentinian/Spanish version was less fatty, though still definitely juicy. Oddly enough, I ordered the grilled potatoes with cheese sauce as a side dish, and they brought out a baked potato with sour cream and chives. That wouldn't have been my selection had I known.Service was attentive and the salad bar had good, but few options. The server did recommend an excellent Malbec to pair with the steak, so maybe I'll bump up to 3.5 stars. Probably worth a visit if you want a break from tapas.",
