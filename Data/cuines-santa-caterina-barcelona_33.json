    "First let me say that the bathroom is awesome. \u00a0A unisex space that overlooks the redone Mercat Santa Caterina with amazing \u00a0fixtures. And the food - excellent!. The service was a little slow,even by Barcelona standards and that's why I didn't give it five stars. The ''Butifarra'' (sausage) with mushrooms and foie gras was lovely, as was the crayfish paella. Our son loved the tapas, especially the sardinhas. Owned by the same people as the Michelin starred Tragaluz , this is a much more approachable and affordable restaurant that makes good use of it's location in the historic Mercat. Highly recommended!",
