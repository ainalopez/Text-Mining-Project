    "Milk has a nice and cozy atmosphere. \u00a0It has a bar/counter or tables for food/drink. \u00a0Staff are friendly and the food is quite good. \u00a0Milk's fry up selection in the recovery brunch menu is great! (eggs, toast, baked beans, bacon, mushrooms, tomato and home fries). It reminded me of a traditional English breakfast. \u00a0The very berry banana smoothie is also a nice treat made from Greek yogurt. Overall, Milk is great for those who want to have a small break from the great tapas in Barcelona.",
