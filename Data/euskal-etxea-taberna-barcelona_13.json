    "1.80 for a pintxo I believe. I wasn't convinced really by anything I ate here though it was recommended by locals. My palate was a little overcome with salt here, so that's my overall impression of it. There is also no sitting space if you're doing pintxos. Not really a good place to go to after a long day out on the city unless you're eating at the restaurant portion of the place. It's a straightforward place, though even getting a standing table to lean and eat your food can be a struggle when it gets crowded...to me it's not worth fighting for though, so the hordes can have Euskal Etxea.",
