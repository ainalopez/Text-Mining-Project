    "Hands down one of the best places to get seafood in Barcelona. \u00a0Everything is fresh and and made to order and the prices are excellent. \u00a0The atmosphere is a little chaotic but the staff does a good job of keeping things organized and making sure that everyone has a table before their food is ready.As some have mentioned, it could be tricky for non-Spanish speakers and if you hold up the line the people waiting behind you will most likely get grouchy. \u00a0The best way to handle this is to have a dictionary on hand and give some thought to what you want to order beforehand so that you're prepared when you get to the head of the line.Great place to go with a group to get some awesome food in a relaxed atmosphere.",
