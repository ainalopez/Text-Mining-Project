[
    "Vaso de Oro (The Golden Glass or Glass of Gold, more accurately) is a venerable, narrow, immensely popular bar in the Barceloneta district which is always full, and for a simple reason: it serves first-rate tapas, good chilled beer, and is invariably animated and enjoyable. You'll get the reliable classics such as pimientos de Padr\u00f3n, patatas bravas and croquetas, and more adventurous dishes as well, with fresh seafood and molluscs. Generally a very good option if you're near the port and fancy a quick bite.",
