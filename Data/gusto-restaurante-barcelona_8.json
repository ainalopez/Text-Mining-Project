    "If I could make this a 6 star review I would. \u00a0My husband and I visited here on our honeymoon and were blown away by our experience! \u00a0The ambiance was really cool and chic with pictures of the beautiful Sofia Lauren covering the walls and a traditional tiled pizza oven. \u00a0We were served an aperitivo of Campari and Soda soon after we sat, and really got to enjoy the vibe of the restaurant. \u00a0We had one Margherita each, accompanied with a very cold bottle of white wine that the waiter recommended, which was a perfect match. \u00a0The pizza came out super fast and hot, just like in Napoli!! The dough was perfectly cooked, soft and tender with bold flavors and just the right amount of mozzarella :) \u00a0The owner and his staff seemed very attentive to their customers and really made my husband and I feel special as if we had known them forever. \u00a0We enjoyed our experience so much, we visited their sister restaurant near Av. Diagonal 'Margherita' which was also superb. \u00a0We will definitely be returning the next time we are in Barcelona!!",
