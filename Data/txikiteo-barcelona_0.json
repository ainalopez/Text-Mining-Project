    "What a wonderful find! I am definitely a fan of this restaurant. Only 11 minute walk from the Grand Marina Hotel as well. \u00a0We had a delightful time. Our lovely waiter was Jordi. \u00a0He was so great in describing every detail on how the food was prepared. \u00a0We loved the duck and paella. \u00a0Wine was wonderful. \u00a0A great low priced restaurant not to be missed.",
