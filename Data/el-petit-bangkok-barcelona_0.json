    "Came here last night with the wife after seeing all the ratings- this place meets the hype, both in terms of hospitality and food.Massaman curry- got the chicken, very rich. The chicken was flavorful and not too soft. Not too spicy as we got the mild, imagine eating just 1 Hot Cheeto chip.Pad Thai - noodles were firm and perfect. Sauce had a hint of sweet and not too overpowering. The shrimp were large and fresh, did not have that preservative bitterness that is present in other restaurants- it complemented the overall dish very well.Shrimp rolls- hot and crispy on the outside, soft and savory inside. The perfect amount of coating. Hospitality- we came last minute at 9 without a reservation, but they squeezed us in because someone finished early, telling us if it was ok if we finished before the next reservation arrived - great management and compassion for a weary traveler.",
