    "An interesting bar with a diverse selection of domestic beer on tap, wine, and the must try sangria and a great concert spot in the basement.I love just randomly walking into a place and being pleasantly surprised. That's what happened with my girlfriend and I walking into La Rumbeta. We had a hankering for trying some domestic beer, so we walked in here attracted by the hole-in-the-wall features and cheap beer prices. The interior in the front is small and newly decorated, lacking the lived-in style this place will develop. We ordered our local beer (excellent by the way) at the counter and was served at the table. While there, we noticed a steady stream of people coming in and walking towards the back downstairs. We thought that was strange but didn't think much of it. We were getting up to leave, one of the staff came over and said they are having a Groupon concert in the basement and we're invited as their guests. So we were led downstairs to a really cool concert basement. The basement was all new, with a small stage and seating for maybe 25 people at the most with a bar in the side room. What a treat it was to go to the concert and be able to sample the Sangria while listening to Spanish music. The Sangria here is also really great.It was an unforgettable experience, and with such a wonderful gesture from the host, I'd be inclined to come back here and just hang out.",
