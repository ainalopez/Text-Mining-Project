    "Delicious sushi that is super fresh! Only thing missing was Sriracha which funny enough they have bottles on display but not for the table...odd. But overall really tasty. Started with the Beef Kung Pao which was served with rice. The portion was very small but flavors were delicious and spicy. We the split 2 rolls the Unicorn Roll (shrimp tempura topped with spicy tuna) so fresh!! And the CuRRy Tuna Tango which had amazing flavor.Probability of return: highly likely",
