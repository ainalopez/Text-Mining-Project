    "A solid option anytime you're in the mood for asian food. You pick your meat, your noodles, and sauce and veggies, the cook then makes your meal in a wok in front of you, and you have great food ready for you in minutes. The prices are resonable, and the sauces are a hit and miss. There isn't much seating place in the location, however, the food portions are humongous. Great option if you're in the look for satisfying food that doesn't burn a hole in your pocket.",
