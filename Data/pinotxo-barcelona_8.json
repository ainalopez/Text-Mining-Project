    "Such very good food but so little seating available as it is in the hustle and bustle of La Boqueria Mercat. It was the busiest place there, which tells you right there how good they were. We tried the chickpeas, beans or peas with calamari, snails, and fried lamb plus bread. \u00a0Plus the local beer and sparkling wine that was great. If you make your way even close to this market, definitely eat here and don't settle for those options on La Rumbla as this was the best! Our Spanish friends insisted, and they were right!",
