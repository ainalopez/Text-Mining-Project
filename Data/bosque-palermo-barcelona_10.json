    "Fantastic food and lively atmosphere. The staff is attentive although they can be extremely busy any night of the week and you'll have to fight for their attention. Food arrives quite fast even when they are busy. It's a little noisy inside and near a busy road outside but the food is fantastic and worth it. Seafood Paella is great and I've had it twice now. Consistently excellent both times. They recently remodeled and the place looks clean yet still feels local and with a family restaurant atmosphere.",
