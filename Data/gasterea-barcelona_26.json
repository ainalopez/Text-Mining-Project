    "Barcelona is not known for for its tapas (strictly speaking, that's more of a southern Spanish tradition), but this place is a solid choice if you're craving small plates. They have an extensive rotating menu of different items, mixing classics with house specialties.The formula is pretty simple: there are a number of freshly prepared tapas under glass on the bar, and you just grab a glass of wine or a cold beer and pick a couple to munch on. There is also a printed menu (with English translations if you need them), from which you can order other items from the kitchen. The drink of choice is Txakoli, a lightly carbonated, dry Basque white wine that is perfect on a warm Spanish evening. The servers are friendly and accustomed to tourists, even though the place is not located in a particularly tourist-heavy neighborhood, and therefore draws a good mix of locals and out-of-towners.",
