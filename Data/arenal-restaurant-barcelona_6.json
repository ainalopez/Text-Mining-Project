    "What a find in Barcelona! We were looking for a restaurant for some goof paella, and came across this restaurant. It was a bit hard to find, but luckily we didn't give up too easily (it's by the beach). \u00a0 Even though the menu indicated each paella has to be 2 person portion or more, they were really nice to overlook that. \u00a0We ordered two paella (one was paella with seafood, and the other was paella with squid ink). Both were good, but I liked the one with quid ink better (not as salty and with more seafood flavor). \u00a0They also gave bread to go with the paella. \u00a0After the meal, taking a walk on the beach is a great ending for the meal.",
