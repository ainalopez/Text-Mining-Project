    "Found on yelp while visiting Barcelona..This place is beautiful inside, the locals hang out there, and this is the type of restaurant I wanted to see while visiting spain.. Try the Paella! Crispy bottom, Delicious! \u00a0I was in Spain for 8 days and tried Paella almost every night and nothing came close to what they had served me. Awesome meats that u can sample and buy, and if they don't have it they have a sister meat market down the block where they will cut and seal for you.. if and when I go back to Barcelona this is my first spot for drinks, Tapas, Paella!!",
