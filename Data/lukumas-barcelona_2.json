    "Lukumas has been on my list for a while, after seeing the glowing Yelp reviews and taking a peek at their website I knew I'd have to make the trip up to Gracia for some breakfast one of these days. I am a huge doughnut fan and I was absolutely pleased by these delicious treats, but more than that the shop in general was a delight. The neighborhood is one of my favorites in Barcelona, and I can happily say that Lukumas will absolutely become a must-do next time I'm up here in the AM. My friend and I grabbed a spot at the back table and met three excellent, new friends who life just up the road and fell in love with the music the cute guy behind the counter was playing. Sigurose, Fleet Foxes, Arcade Fire + doughnuts + friendly Barceloneses makes this place perfect!",
