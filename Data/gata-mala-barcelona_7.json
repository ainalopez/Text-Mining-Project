    "Fantastic! We arrived close to when they opened and were some of the first customers there. Not much english was spoken but that didn't matter. Everyone was so friendly and kind. We ordered a couple of cervezas and with each, came an amazing snack. One of the owners came over to us and spoke a bit of english. She was so kind, so went to call her partner who spoke perfect english to come in and talk with us. We had such a nice visit here and only got a sample a few items as we were headed to other places, but it has been most memorable. They even gave us a phone number in case we need anything during our time in Barcelona. Between the excellent food, service, prices and pure kindness, we will be back many times.",
