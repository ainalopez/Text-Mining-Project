    "Nicely done burgers. Big burgers that come in a wide chose of varieties. The price ranges from 6 to 9 euros depending on the condiments you add. The regular meat quality you get with the burger is awesome, but you can add much more awesomeness by choosing Angus or ecological beef. The chicken burger (which is a crispy chicken fillet) is great. Veggie burger version is also available but haven't tried it yet.",
