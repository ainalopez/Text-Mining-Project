    "A Carnival for the eyes. \u00a0Bang! As the smoke lifts and disperse came the dish, Confit artichoke with quail egg yolk and salmon roe. \u00a0As one dish come after another in a timely manner served by a lovely young lady, we watched the chefs in the kitchen orchestrate in a composed pace. \u00a0..3,5..Tickets' olive-S, a molecular bubble of intense olive. \u00a0Razor Clams with refried sauce and lemon air. \u00a0Confit Potatoes with iberian cured ham and pork rib jus. \u00a0\"El Manteca\" double chin \"mollen. \u00a0White chocolate and black sesame lava rock.Ingredients of some dishes are transformed through scientific techniques to allow for a whimsical display to the audience, while a few items are plain Jane boring to the eyes, ears, nose, mouth. \u00a0Plates that seem like it could of came from any other local tapas restaurant.I have a feeling that the \"story book\" menu is larger than it should be. Too many chances for patrons to choose a mediocre dish through the whole meal, which I believe happened to me. \u00a0I had some recommended breakfast McMuffin, which I regret spending \u20ac\u20ac on but I was still hungry, if you know what I mean.Highly appreciate the experience to partake molecular gastronomy in Spain, at a pleasantly \u00a0down-to-earth acceptable price in comparison to other 50BEST restaurants. \u00a0While it's not my most memorable experience, it's still an intriguing tale to share.",
