    "Yumm!!This was one of the best places (quality+quantity+price-wise!) I went to while visiting Barcelona!It's a little place, with about 5 tables or so - but most of their menu items are to-go things, so don't worry too much about sitting down!HIGHLY recommend their chicken-salad platter (6 euros, and can easily be shared by two people!) and their patatas bravas (3 euros) are to DIE for!!",
