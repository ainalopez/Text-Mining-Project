    "We came to this restaurant via some online recommendation blogs. First, I have to say, the service is below average. I wonder if it's because there are too many tourists so they don't really mind how people feel about their services. Second, the food is just okay. We ordered a Paella Valencia (we were thinking to order fish Paella but somehow we changed our mind to this). When it delivered to us, it surprised us cause it's made by chicken. We really didn't know at the beginning...it's not their fault but I think if they would spend some time to introduce their meal, this wouldn't happen.",
