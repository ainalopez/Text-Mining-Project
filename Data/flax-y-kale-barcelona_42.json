    "Sooo good. \u00a0For the food sensitive/intolerant crowd it is a GREAT alternative to a sea of ham, tomato bread, cuttlefish and croquettes aka tapas. \u00a0When you can eat something that actually makes you feel better it's amazing. \u00a0I have a very weird stomach and I just can't eat some things. \u00a0Was in BCN for work for 2 weeks and after day 2 lamented that I was not going to be able to eat anything. \u00a0I mostly eat local, organic, etc.Here comes Yelp to save the day and this restaurant did not disappoint. I am not at all a vegetarian but being able to see ingredients, which items were gluten free, and a good variety of oily fish was great. \u00a0Also the juices were really really good for the body, at least it was for my angry stomach filled with Iberian ham.The interior is nice. \u00a0The service was fine and pretty standard with the rest of BCN (although yes slow by USA standards). \u00a0My only -1 stars is there were annoying fruit flies in the building, but this seems to be a city-wide issue. \u00a0It's really more of a .5Final comments: went there twice and brought him the second time. Even he liked it and called it the highlight meal of the trip. \u00a0He ordered a latte and I discovered that even the coffee was amazing. It's really good and I hope it survives. \u00a0They care about ingredients, freshness and presentation. \u00a0It's a restaurant that easily could be in Los Angeles as a trendy place where the \"stars\" eat.",
