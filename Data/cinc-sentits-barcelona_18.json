    "Probably one of the most underrated restaurants in Barcelona when I first came to visit a few years ago. Then it was just a newly opened family run restaurant and has since been receiving many accolades which are justly deserved including a Michelin star.This is fine dining in Barcelona without the all the unnecessary pretentiousness. Amazing setting, service and flavors. A modern flair on Catalan cuisine. The chef, Artal, is a Canadian! (Bonus points in my book)The foie gras \"coca\" with balsamic-glazed leeks, burnt-sugar crust, chives is among my all-time favorite dishes and an amazing creation in the world of cuisine.In an ode to canada, he also serves a famous L'Arp\u00e8ge egg dish of yolk, whipping cream, sherry vinegar, maple syrup and rock salt.If you're visiting Barcelona, plan to stop here and enjoy.",
