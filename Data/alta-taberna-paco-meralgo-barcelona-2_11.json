    "I came back to Paco Meralgo at least 5 times after the first meal. \u00a0The best Patatas Bravas I had in Catalonia. \u00a0Perfectly crispy, and the chili oil and aioli gave it a nice spice kick.Highlights:-Black Pepper Steak. \u00a0I ordered this medium rare, and it came perfectly pink-red from the center out to the very edge of the meat. \u00a0Tender, flavorful, and the portion size (as with most tapas) was perfect to enjoy. \u00a0One of the best steaks of my life. \u00a0No hyperbole.-Ham and Chicken Croquettes. \u00a0Nothing complicated about these. \u00a0Just really well made croquettes full of flavor.-The Bikini. \u00a0Also nothing complicated, but a perfect grilled ham and cheese. \u00a0-Ox Tail on Mash Patatas. Dessert:-Pear soaked in red wine. \u00a0Unique! \u00a0Amazing!-Hazelnut Ice Cream tasted like a Ferrero Roche.",
