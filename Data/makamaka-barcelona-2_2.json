    "This place is located next to the beach and easy to spot with their huge terrace and swarms of teen customers. We ordered their famous garlic parmesan fries to try but the waitress gave us the normal ones and we didn't have the heart to tell her she got the order wrong. The burger I ordered was okay but not super tasty and there was no sauce which is key to a good, juicy burger. The chili cocktail I ordered was good but awfully small for the price. All in all, a decent place that seems overhyped to me.",
