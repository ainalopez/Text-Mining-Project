    "Arrived at 20:55 on a Tuesday after a short walk from my hotel. Uh, oh--line nearly out the door. Left name. Grabbed a glass of red down the street. Returned at 21:15 as suggested. Seated five minutes later. Tables a little tight, but it all seems to work.The kitchen turns it out reasonably fast. Finished my salad and next course arrived nearly that instant. Dishes well presented. Food excellent. Place packed with diners, but not unduly noisy. No need to tire the reader with how excellent the food actually is. \u00a0I wonder if there is anything bad on the menu. Can't imagine. Plenty of good reviews written already. Reviews are correct. Go eat here, even if you think you have to eat meat three meals a day. You won't miss flesh for one meal--not at this place.Had the house red--Tempranillo, I think it was. This is a \"+\" on the Monterey Coventry wine scale. Bottles kept in small wine reefer in a corner of the dining room, so the temperature is spot on from the first sip.Young waitstaff, some are still learning. Give 'em a break.Will absolutely return before leaving this city.",
