    "The place looked like a normal restaurant for lunch and we took a chance. Inside the place is huge with only small part being used where all of the customers are bunched together, which made me feel like you're sitting on a top of someone else's table. The overall atmosphere inside is of a cheap diner with dated furniture and some plates and cup chipped. They start by bringing you some bread, which later you find you get charged for. Me and my friend ordered burgers and asked for well done ... When those came- both were rare inside. After this was brought to staffs attention , they offered to cook it longer, no apologies. After a while of waiting we did end up asking to pay for what we owe and leave ... One of the servers did apologize and brought the bill at which point I did notice a charge for the bread and extra drink (which we didn't order) but whatever at this point we both wanted to get out of there and get a proper meal.",
