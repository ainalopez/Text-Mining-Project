    "Excellent #tapas and #cava in this cute little cafe. #barcelona #restaurantreviewWaiter asked if we wanted \"mixto\" of tapas. We said yes and let him bring whatever he chose. Everything was tasty. High quality meats, bread, oils and seafood. Known for their anchovies, and also their cava drink (like champagne). We particularly enjoyed the bell peppers stuff with cheese, and crackers with tuna and baby tomatoes. Get here early! It gets crowded quickly even on the weekdays. Accepts credit cards.",
