    "I have eaten at La Fonda many times. \u00a0The first time the service was horrible. \u00a0The servers ignore you. \u00a0If you need eating utensils or plates for your bread the servers don't care- you may need to get up and get it on your own. \u00a0Luckily they are available in the middle of the restaurant on racks. \u00a0My last visit was February 5, 2014. \u00a0The service was bad once again. \u00a0My pork tenderloin was so tough you needed a steak knife to cut it and good luck getting a server to bring you one! \u00a0We had a group of 6 and ordered the price fix menu 3 course. \u00a0 I have to say the dessert was the best. I had the chocolate mousse cake. \u00a0I do not recommend this \u00a0restaurant -it's in a tourist location so they get business they don't deserve!",
