    "Coolest place in barcelona! The bartender and owner is super friendly and kind and makes the most unique rum ever! So many flavors and so individual!!It really made our night trying the different flavors like cinnamon, cucumber, lime, lavender, ginger. Everything was fresh fruit or spices and definitely exceeded our expectations!Atmosphere here is the best we've been to yet. Awesome lighting, music, people and conversation. I would say it's a must see:)",
