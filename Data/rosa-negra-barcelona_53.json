    "Love love love this place. Margaritas are amazing and cheap, food is equally as amazing and it's a cute little place that reminds me of Texas. Definitely a must. I recommend the passion fruit marg, chips and guac and the taco plate or the beef quesadillas. If I lived here I would be here once a week if not more :)",
