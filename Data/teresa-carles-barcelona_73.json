    "Good food but comes with a very slow and disjointed service. The vegetarian concept is very well done but you need to decide if you can put up with the poor service before you try it. Service in Barcelona is generally slow anyway but this was worse than \"normal\". Even though we had made a reservation already, when we got there the host wanted to put us in the front area which was already packed while the back areas were totally empty. When I refused, then he takes us to a table which was actually held for us because it had my name written on a small board on it. The host just wanted to pack one area before seating in the other areas. Overall food was good and unique but be ready for SLOW service.",
