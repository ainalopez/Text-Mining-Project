    "Great music.Kind staff.We only had to ask four different people directions, the last set of people had us walk around the block, we were right next to it. I wouldn't say its diff to find, I just had a general idea of the location, not an address, my bad. Great atmosphere inside, lots of ephemera. There is also a patio across the street, but we choose to sit in side in the dark, when in a Barcelona. I've had absinthe before, but couldn't drink it. Here they do it up with the sugar cube, flame and water! It's almost good:)",
