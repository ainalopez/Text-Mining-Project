    "This place has to be one of the most cramped quarters of a restaurant bar with one or two tables. It is swarming with locals interacting with the staff behind the long bar spanning the narrow space of this establishment. Not the place to go if you want good ambience or a five star dining experience, it is a bar after all, but if you want good food, plus friendly staff, don't let any of the other things hinder you. I highly recommend the sirloin with pablano peppers. Sirloin is tender and flavorful. Croquettes and jamon Serrano are also good. Smoked salmon and manchego cheese are decent but not highlights. Order a beer or two to pair. And bring cash!",
