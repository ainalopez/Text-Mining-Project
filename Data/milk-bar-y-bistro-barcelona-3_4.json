    "We came here for an early breakfast/recovery brunch based on the recommendation from our host. \u00a0I fell in love with the restaurant the moment we walked in! \u00a0With comfy booth seating and eclectic decor, it's easy to see why this place gets high ratings from fellow Yelpers! \u00a0True that the bistro caters to an American crowd, but the food was thoughtfully prepared to incorporate local flavors! \u00a0It was such a great way to start off your day. Bonus, they purchase their produce from the famous Boqueria market daily!FOOD: I had the Morning Glory which was French toast, yogurt and fruit. \u00a0The toast was not as fluffy compared to what I'm used to but it was very delicious nevertheless. \u00a0The creamy greek yogurt and fruit made this a healthy yet satisfying breakfast choice! \u00a0My boyfriend really enjoyed the eggs benedict with his morning coffee! \u00a0SERVICE: since we arrived just after they opened at 9 am, our food came out in about 10 minutes or so. \u00a0I loved our waiter's British accent! \u00a0He's such a master barista preparing various caffeinated drinks beyond the bar.Overall, we had a lovely breakfast here! \u00a0The food was very tasty yet affordable for the quality. \u00a0Highly recommend this bistro for breakfast/bunch!",
