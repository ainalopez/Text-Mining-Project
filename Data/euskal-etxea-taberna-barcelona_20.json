    "We started our night of Tapas crawling here at 5.30pm, and were able to snag a table before the hordes of tourists and locals arrived at 6pm. The concept is simple: grab a plate, help yourself to the tapas (all skewered individually on toothpicks) and savour with a delicious glass of house red or white. Then pay by the number of toothpicks left on your plate (about 1 euro/toothpick plus drinks, of course). A great way to try out tapas and make it as inexpensive or pricey as you'd like. As a confirmed veggie, I was still able to try four or five different tapas (caution: check with the servers as many often have hidden fish surprises).The goat cheese croquettes and the blue cheese with marmalade (all served on bread) had me going back for seconds. I had to stop at thirds so that I didn't get too full right at the start of the night!",
