    "You want to show up about a half hour before they open (or reopen) because otherwise you'll wait much longer for everything and probably not get a table. The sandwiches are great and they make it right in front of you as you pick the ingredients you want from the case. Salmon is my favorite. All of the sauces are great too, and you can pick multiple ones to go on your sandwich. I also love their potatoes. The sauces served with them are also awesome. I was in Barcelona for 3 weeks and during this time I probably ate at Bo De B 6-8 times. Yes, I'm obsessed. But the prices are so affordable for a traveler on a budget that how could I not be so in love with this place?!?",
