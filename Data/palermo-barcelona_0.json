    "OMG. This place. This place was amazing. We were walking around in Barcelona and had a hankering for local tapas. My travel companion and I were convinced the locals would know best. So we stopped in a small shop and asked where we could get some tapas for lunch that wasn't touristy. She recommended Palermo, and we were absolutely delighted with it. The crowd inside was completely local, and the tapas, absolutely delightful. Everything on the menu is amazing and I highly recommend the Padron peppers and the Pulpo. The serving sizes are large, so 3 dishes will be more than enough for 2 people. 4* for awesome tapas.",
