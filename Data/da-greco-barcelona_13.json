    "This place is a real gem! My family and I wanted some Italian food and we did not want to settle for just anything. We consulted Yelp and the hotel concierge and finally landed on this restaurant. Just as the reviews below state, this place is the real deal. The wine was great. The prices were even better! We ordered some appetizers - mel\u00f3n con prosciutto and the caprese salad. Both were great. Then, most of us ordered pasta dishes which were great! The chefs understand! They brought out extra plates of pasta for everyone to try because \"they know how it can be when everyone is sampling from the same plate!\" We were amazed... And then stuffed. I also must mention the service was outstanding- multilingual and we felt like we had an elite team watching out for us the entire meal! Kudos! Celebrating my brother's 28th birthday, they brought out a beautiful bottle of limoncello to top it all off. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in Barcelona!",
