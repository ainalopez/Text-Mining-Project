The patatas bravas were more unique than I had anywhere else. It was more like a hassleback sliced baked potato. Oh, and the goat cheese stuffed sweet red peppers. to.die.for. oh wow. i haven't been able to stop thinking about those peppers. i think i died and went to heaven. please, please do yourself a favor and come here.",
