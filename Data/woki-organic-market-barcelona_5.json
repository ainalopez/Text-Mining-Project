    "Amazing find in Barcelona! Very cute and friendly servers (Antonio from Espana!!!) We had the hummus, olives, pizza, and salads for lunch. We loved it so much we came back for dinner and had wok dishes. They were all very good but we added more spicy sauce. We also had cava, beer and red wine which were great. We ended with delicious organic ice cream and took some orange juice home. Great food and lovely staff!!!",
