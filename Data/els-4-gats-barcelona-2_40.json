    "4 Stars for the decor, 2 stars for the food, 4 stars for the service.Nothing special on the food items, the Lobster rice is a poor choice at E22, make with the smallest lobster I have ever seen, the tuna was good, others had different fish dishes that were just ok.Have a glass of wine and a snack, see the big back room and dine elsewhere.",
