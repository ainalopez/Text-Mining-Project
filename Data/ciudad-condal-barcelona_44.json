    "Incredible! The wait takes forrreeevveerrr but it's worth it. After you check in with the hostess go outside to the \"secret\" side bar and she will serve you drinks there rather than trying to battle the massive crowd inside.We ordered the beef fillets on toast (aaahhh so good!), croquettes (decent but not as good as tapas 24), a slider for the hubby (he says amazing), the camembert lollipops (ORDER IT- DO IT), and I had goat cheese and eggplant with toast and that was also noms. House wine was amazing and service was nice too, they are very busy but i didn't feel pressured/ rushed.",
