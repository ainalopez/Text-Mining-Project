    "We happened upon the Ohla Gastronomic Bar on our way to see the Flamenco show at the Palau de la Musica Catalana for a small bite to eat and a bottle of wine. Even though they have a menu in English, we had our waiter recommend some tapas, and the gazpacho, roast chicken and mushroom croquettes, and spiced pork ribs were all delicious. \u00a0It was so good we came back afterwards for some post-show cocktails. The bartender carefully and attentively crafted each cocktail with such care. Granted, I'm a simple mojito loving gal, but they were so flavorful and perfectly prepared, I ordered three.The ambience is modern, but the noise level was intimate and quiet. Highly recommended. I would love to stay here sometime!",
