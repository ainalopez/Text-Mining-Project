    "It is nice to see a restaurant serving itzakaya Japanese food rather than sushi sushi sushi. On that note I thought that some of the dishes lacked a freshly prepared taste. For one reason or another. They weren't hot enough or I was vaguely suspicious they might be reheated. I grew up in a half Japanese household and have Japanese family so Japanese food is something I am very knowledgeable about. This place satisfied a craving but it didn't blow me away. However it is headed in the right direction. If they wanted to really up the game they should have Robata! The vegetable croquette with Okonomiaki type sauce was my favorite.",
