    "We went here for a late snack and bottle of wine, and the bartenders couldn't have been friendlier. It was packed so we sat in the only two available bar stools, and they were quick to get us wine and menus. GREAT wine selection, good food, wonderful atmosphere on a Friday night. Would go there again if we were staying longer!",
