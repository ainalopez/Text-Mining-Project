    "Nice place, friendly staff. They charge for mustard, didn't see any ketchup, and there is mayo on the burger. The napkins are like tissue paper, so be prepared to use about 200 of them. So, my main complaint is I asked for a well-done burger, no pink in the middle (yes, one of those few people who likes a well-done burger). I got my $7 burger totally pink in middle, hence couldn't eat most of it. The parts I did eat had gristle in every bite. Disappointed.",
