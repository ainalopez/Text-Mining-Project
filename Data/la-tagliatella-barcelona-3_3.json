    "I was getting tired of tapas and this was a very good find!Pasta comes in a huge portion. \u00a0You choose pasta and sauce from many different kinds! \u00a0Pizza has some interesting topping combinations. I tried a pasta with cream sauce and egg on top, and pizza with eggplant with balsamic drizzle. Pasta needed a bit of kick but the pizza was great! Very affordable price and cozy ambiance.take-out seems to be quite popular.PS: It is just cross the street from the Hotel Renaissance.",
