    "I have been tasting around tapas dishes at different restaurants in Barcelona for a few days now and followed a friends recommendation to Tantaratana. Absolutely delicious tapas, the best I've had and we will be going back there before we leave. Make it a point to visit, excellent service, environment, and you can also sit outside. This will become a must go for us in future trips.",
