    "Wonderful sushi place. We got the nekkai roll and rainbow row, both of which were delicious. We also got the yakisoba, salmon sashimi, and eel nigiri, all of which were incredibly fresh and delicious. In particular, the salmon was very buttery and not at all fishy. Service was great as well, although they indicate on the bill that tip is not included. It was a great place to end our trip through Barcelona.",
