    "Seafood paellaNext to the shore of the seaQuite pleasant for meCame to Salamanca at the recommendation of my Yelp friend, Charlene L. \u00a0Close to \u00a0five stars, but not quite.We arrived there about 6 PM and the place was pretty empty. \u00a0Cab driver thought we were totally nuts for eating at such an early hour. \u00a0Got seated on their large outdoor patio which has the Mediterranean Sea for its backyard. \u00a0By the time we left at about 8, the place was starting to fill up.All but one of us went with the seafood paella. \u00a0Some of the best that I have ever had, but I have not had a whole lot. \u00a0Tons of flavorful seafood. \u00a0My only complaint is that the rice was a little bit crunchy for my 'murican tastes.Had a couple pitchers of the Sangria, both red and white. \u00a0Tasty and potent. \u00a0You should leave stuffed after finishing your meal at Salamanca. \u00a0Luckily, the beach is about 50 feet away and you can walk off some of your meal.",
