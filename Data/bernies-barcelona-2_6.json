    "Seems silly to want to eat American style fare when in Europe, but we actually ended up eating here twice on our trip along with other Spanish restaurants (come on, we're not that uncultured). The food was great and the ambience did a great job of giving you that hokey diner feel. It's a very clean restaurant in a cool little part of the gothic district. The menu was your typical burgers and fries but they were very, very good. The wings were delicious, but very small. Overall we really enjoyed this restaurant as it kind of reminded us of home.",
