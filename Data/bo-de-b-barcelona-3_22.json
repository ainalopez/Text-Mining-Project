    "In a city where most meals are expensive, I would say this place is a gem.You get a HUGE sandwich for 4.50 euros. Perfect to bring to the beach.My only issue was that I'm not a huge fan of onions and capers, so I had to pick it out of my sandwich. \u00a0My bad for not asking before I agreed to put \"everything\" on my sandwich.",
