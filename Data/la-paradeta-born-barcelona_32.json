    "I cannot understand why this place has such great reviews. The line that extends outside of the restaurant is there because ordering and weighing the seafood with only two people who aren't especially quick with it takes a hell of a long time. None of the seafood on display is really that \"fresh\". They sit on a bed of ice, are lifeless, and the shrimp is pre-cooked. The only thing I'll give them credit for is the price. I can't suggest a different fresh seafood spot in Barcelona, but I can suggest that you shouldn't be waiting an hour for this food.The most awful thing was the calamari! We had it fried so we expected it to be...fried? Crunchy? It was limp, rubbery, and we could not finish it at all. We wondered for a while if their idea of fried is what we had experienced that night, but I clearly remember seeing fried crispy calamari being eaten at other restaurants.Long story short, don't waste your time here!",
