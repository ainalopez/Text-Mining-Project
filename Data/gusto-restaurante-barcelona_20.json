    "The place looks really pleasant and the staff are very friendly. The olive starter was fine with a nice pesto dressing. Pizzas were srved far too quickly and were lukewarm. Tomato base was homemade but all turned into a sloppy mess because of the cold oppings. The fresh prawns were grilled and these were overdone making the flesh pretty nasty in taste. Not impressed.",
