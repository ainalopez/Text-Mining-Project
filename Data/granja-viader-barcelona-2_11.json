    "We have visited here while we were visiting Barcelona. It seems like a local place, there are only locals here but they have a menu with 4 languages! They have an old school interior and A big selection of pastries! What is really good that the hot chocolate, it is not the hot chocolate you think! It is like a pudding, not so heavy at all! Quite yummy! \u00a0You should stop by here for a coffee break and continue on your shopping walk in the Ramblas!",
