    "This place truly is a fantastic find thanks to yelp!Everything we had was out of this world. My favorite dining experience while I have been in Barcelona and whenever I go back and the first place I will suggest will be this place.The food was incredible, the drinks were so tasty, you can watch the kitchen do their amazing job.This is what we ate in the order of what I liked the most all were so awesome though.To drink: Sangria de Cava we started with a 1/2 Liter and it was so tasty we ordered a full liter shortly after.To eat:Iberian pork ribs with honey and mustard, Sausage with wild mushrooms cannelloni, Bombeta de la Barcelona, Oxtail with Santa Pau beans, Moorish skewer lamb with mint yogurt, Stuffed squid with vegetables.Can't wait to go back!",
