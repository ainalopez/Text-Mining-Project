    "Let me start with the important fact that these are debatably the best sandwiches I've ever had. My boyfriend and I were only going to be in Barcelona for four days in mid May. This place was recommended by a former traveling friend. Well it was so good that my bf insisted that we go back again the next day. So we did. Both times we split the chicken and steak sandwiches with all the fixings, but the second time we knew we had to try the potatoes too. Sooo good and soooo cheap! \u00a0The line was pretty long both times but I guess no one was local enough to know that you can eat inside. There was only a few tables but we were able to snag one each time with no waiting! The owner i think is a Greek woman? Maybe not. Either way, she talked to us, was so nice, gave us a business card and posed for a pic. I wish I could have brought her home with me.",
