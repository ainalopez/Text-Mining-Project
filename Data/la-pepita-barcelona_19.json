    "My sister took my hubby and I here for dinner during our Barcelona stay. Being that she's basically a local living in barcelona, I trusted her great foodie choices. The place was packed with a lot of people on a Monday night and the service was great . We didnt have to wait long for our tapas to make it to our table and into our mouths. Fave plates: tuna in a can, sardine, patatas bravas and asparagus with coco powder. Least fave plates: steak tartar (sauce overwhelmed the protein) and chicken croquettes. We loved the atmosphere and the location was easy to get to.",
