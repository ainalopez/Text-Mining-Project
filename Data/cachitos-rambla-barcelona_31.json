    "There's a plethora of restaurants on La Rambla. The restaurant we had hoped to try our last evening in Barcelona was closed so we choose Cachitos. The inviting outdoor seating, hunger and proximity to our hotel made it an easy choice. Unfortunately, our last meal in Spain was memorable for the wrong reason. My mixed seafood Paella was about void of any seafood. 2 dried out shrimp and some rubbery calamari. Our waiter was extremely pushy almost insisting we add some tapas to our order. They were out of the wine we ordered the slightly more expensive one our server brought was OK. Funny thing was that everyone around us was having the same wine. We suspect it was a spiffed wine for the restaurant. Cachitos wasn't bad but you can surely do better.",
