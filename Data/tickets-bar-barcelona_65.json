    "This restaurant was certainly the highlight of our trip. My husband is a big fan of the Adria brothers and so I made sure I made reservations 2 months before our trip- iy was certainly not easy! Everything from the ambiance to the food was exceptional. The restaurant is divided into 4 sections that blend in together in a fun way. 'La Presumida' (Bold) reflects Barcelona's blue waters, the sun, the people. In this section you'll find the traditional Spanish tapas. 'La Estrella' (Star) focuses on drinks focusing in this case on the famous Spanish beer Estrella Damn. 'El Gallinero' (Henhouse) for the lousy rascals (as per Tickets) and finally 'Nostromo 180286' which is where we sat, that has a modern decor where they let their creativity drive them. The food is inspired by El Bulli and you can appreciate a lot of molecular gastronomy without losing on taste!My favorite dishes were: Las Oliva -S, Toro Ham, Oysters with caviar olive oil, razor clams and the highlight was the golden painted fried egg with black truffle (Amazing!)The desserts were outstanding as well and to add on the amazing night we met Albert Adria and spoke to him for 15 minutes - he was so friendly. I guess it helped that I was from Spain and my husband a major fan of his work!",
