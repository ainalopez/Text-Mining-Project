    "One of the best meals we had in Barcelona. \u00a0We came early on a Tuesday night and had no trouble reserving a table for five. \u00a0But, the place filled up really quickly and it's no surprise why. \u00a0We selected the five course meal and had an amazing selection of fish dishes, the egg souffle and the pigeon. \u00a0My least favorite dish was the dessert. \u00a0But, i'd come back here again and maybe try going a la carte to try more of the other plates. \u00a0Definitely a must for foodies.",
