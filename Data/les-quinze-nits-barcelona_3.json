    "This is a superb restaurant that delivers great value. Especially good is the fresh seafood, and a nice comprehensive dessert menu.Although it's in the heart of Plaza Real, inside there is a nice calmish ambience. Outdoor seating is also available if you like to soak up the atmosphere of the plaza.From various visits, several dishes stood out: the battered hake; grilled squids with basil and parsley oil; the Tomato soup; Mushroom and asparagus soup; and for dessert the \"White chocolate cake with two chocolates\".",
