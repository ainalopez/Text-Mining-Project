    "A small tapas bar with pincho style tapas and a great selection of wine. Each pincho was a two euro each and a very nice selection of meat, fish and vegetables. Don't bother with a table. Grab a plate and a spot at the bar and eat. You are charged by the number of toothpicks you have on your plate at the end.",
