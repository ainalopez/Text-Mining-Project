    "I wandered in here after visiting the picasso museum a few weeks ago. its a smallish place with great outside seating, perfect for people watching. \u00a0they have great appetizers like a nice tabouleh salad that i ordered which was a nice and refreshing starter. I had the pizza with anchovies and olives, the pizza is heated up when you order it so theres a little wait. but when it comes out you get an authentic thin crust pizza with just the right amount of sauce and cheese, for about 8 euro you get what likes like a whole pie it can actually be shared with 2 people. alas it was my first meal of the day after a night of drinking- needless to say i was famished and eat it all (don't judge me) !!!",
