    "I stayed at St. Christopher's Inn and got a discount every time I ate at Belushi's, which wasn't really necessary because everything was so cheap anyway. It was the best hostel bar I saw in 4 months--full bar, drink specials every night, local beers, helpful staff, and wonderful food. The spring roll appetizer was filling and the perfect portion to have with a drink. They were crisp and not too greasy, and the dipping sauce was great. I also had a burger with pineapple, bacon, beet root, and a fried egg. What's that, you say? You'd never try beet root or an egg on a burger? Well, you're seriously missing out, then, because this was one of the best burgers I've ever had. The fries weren't anything special, but they were done right. Try an Amstel beer with your burger, there's sometimes a 2 for 1 special for them. Great seating inside and out, great vibe and atmosphere.",
