    "This review is long overdue but totally necessary and deserved. I was here back in April and it was the single BEST decision I made in the course of my entire Mediterranean vacation. We were taking a cruise, so only had 2 nights in Barcelona. The first day here, we passed by Bodega Biarritz and immediately had a good feeling about it. But it was early in the day around 4pm, before it was open or we were hungry, and so we continued on our way exploring and ended up in another section of town by dinnertime. Rather than come back here, we chose a different tapas joint that boasted a lot of good Yelp reviews and ended up majorly disappointed. This brings us to night 2: determined not to leave without a decent tapas meal, we returned to Bodega Biarritz nervous to be burned again -- and left completely satisfied and so, so happy. SO good! It was everything we wanted: good cheap food and good cheap wine. Plus it feels very much like a local place, small and not catering exclusively to tourists. I'm pretty sure everything we had here was delicious, but some items I do remember that I recommend: house ryoja (lots of it), jamon serrano, manchego, blistered peppers, some type of doughy/pastry item, and the CHORIZO, omg, best chorizo I've had in my life. I almost forgot about it because remembering that I've never had chorizo like it before or since makes me a little sad, but seriously it was amazing. I am very, very serious about my tapas and had high expectations coming into Spain, and Bodega Biarritz ended up being exactly what I was looking for. I will recommend this place to everyone I know planning to visit Barcelona from now on!",
