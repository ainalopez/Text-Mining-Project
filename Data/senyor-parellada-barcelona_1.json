    "My go-to restaurant in Barcelona. I came here as a broke college student when I wanted a nice meal in a sophisticated atmosphere. The food is flavorful and well-presented, and priced very reasonably. I actually like that they serve you course after course very quickly because who likes waiting to eat anyways.",
