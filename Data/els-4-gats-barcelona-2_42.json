    "It's a nicely decorated restaurant. I went based on reviews and the whole Picasso-esque experience. Me and my friend were seated in the dining room.Everything was great at first... I ordered a glass of wine and the special of the day, which was scallops in in three different sauces/garnishes: hummus, butternut squash, and a vinegary salad. Pretty good so far, but nothing special.I left pretty content, even though the pricing was a little steep for what I normally pay- but it was an experience at least.When I got back to the hotel, I was overwhelmed with nausea and stayed up all night with food poisoning. Maybe it was just a single isolated case, but I would recommend going here for drinks instead of overpaying for mediocre food. No matter how historical the place is, I have to give it one star. There's no justification for food poisoning.",
