    "El Nacional is gorgeous on the inside and is a very interesting concept that reminds me of Eataly minus the groceries. It has four restaurants inside and a couple of different bars. We went around 6:30/7 p.m. for dinner thinking that we'd beat the crowd since the Catalan eat closer to 8:30 p.m. Wrong! It is in a very touristy shopping area so plenty of other people were ready to kick their feet up around the same time.We got lucky and snagged a seat at the wine and cured meat bar, which is exactly where we wanted to be. I ordered a bottle of the Prioriat and the bartender let me try a taste from an open bottle before we got the bottle. It was awful, but it wasn't because it was an awful wine. The bottle was open too long or something and it had turned into something that resembled vinegar more than wine. Yuck! Got back on track with a different bottle and all was well.We ordered a ton of jamon, as everybody should do when in Barcelona! They have many different kinds, some of which I didn't like unfortunately. However, the best jamon iberico de bellota we had while in Barcelona was here. So, based on that alone I recommend giving El Nacional a try for a drink and some jamon.",
