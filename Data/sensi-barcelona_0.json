    "This restaurant is a more upscale tapas place with plates and dishes that are more advanced and eccentric than the usual tapas scene! Ordered the truffle ravioli and the stir fried vegetables. Both were INCREDIBLE! The ravioli was very filling and had a rich, but not overwhelming, truffle flavor balanced with Parmesan cheese. The vegetables were very fresh and saut\u00e9ed perfectly with a great seasoning. When I go back im ordering the padron peppers and the steak. I tried my friends and they were mind blowing.Also strongly recommend the sangria! It's got a kick but a great flavor with the perfect balance of fruit and a darker liqueur (probably sherry!).",
