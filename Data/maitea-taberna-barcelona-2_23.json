    "Still a 5 star place! We went twice during our last visit in October. Even though it's quite a pain in the booty to get there from our apt in El Born, it is still totally worth it. We tend to go pretty early in the evening around 8:00PM so it's never very busy. Their croquettes are the absolute best. The Patatas Bravas are different but amazing! Oh, top it all off with a fantastic Goxua and you can roll yourself out of there like we did! Just go!",
