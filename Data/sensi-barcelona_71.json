    "We also went twice in the week we spent in Barcelona- duck tapas are to die for!! \u00a0Sangria is the best I had anywhere in Barcelona. \u00a0Everything else was good too and set apart from the usual cheese, meet & salad. \u00a0Love, love, love. \u00a0For best results either make reservations or arrive right at 7 when they open! \u00a0:) and come hungry!",
