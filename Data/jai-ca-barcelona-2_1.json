    "Let see. How do I describe this without sounding too over the top...This, honestly, is, the, best, meal, I've had in Barcelona! The food was simply awesome and boy the tapas, just way too good!The fried prawns, YUM! Meat balls, man I have had better sources! Octopus, how tender! Mushrooms, always loved it! Stuffed mussels, lovely filling! Ramba potato, boy that was special and awesome! Sangria, refreshing!There's not a single fault I can fault this place besides the queue was too long and I spell like I had an awesome feast in a great Spanish restaurant. Price was reasonable we ended up approx \u20ac20 each across 5 of us, but decently full as well. I guess it's hard to be much cheaper for some decent food.Definitely recommend!",
