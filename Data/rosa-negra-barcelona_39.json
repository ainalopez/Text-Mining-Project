    "Good place for Mexican food. \u00a0As close as you'll get to real Mexican food in all of BCN. \u00a0Try the burritos - they are pretty decent. \u00a0They have a very busy cocktail bar that acts as a waiting area while you wait to be seated. \u00a0You can experience long waits here so grab a stool and a margarita. \u00a0Good location too.",
