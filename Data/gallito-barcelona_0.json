    "The paella al nero was perfection. Generous amounts of seafood and creamy texture. However, what completes this restaurant is the interior and location. The open kitchen and sophisticated beach house vibes were awe-worthy. Service was great. Best part was we had our meal on the patio facing the sea. What more can you ask for?",
