    "After walking by several times in the evening after closing hours, I had a free morning and swung by Green Shoots to check out their juice selection. \u00a0They have a very large selection of green (and non-green) juices and smoothies and the women at the register was incredibly friendly and had an English menu ready in case I didn't understand the ingredient lists for each drink.The juice I selected had celery, cucumber, pineapple and apple and was very tasty. \u00a0She freshly made it after I ordered it and it just slightly chilled when she handed it to me. \u00a0I also was enticed by the delicious smelling quiche that they had on the table next to the register and after some deliberation selected a slice of the zucchini, sun dried tomato and goat cheese quiche. \u00a0The quiche was pretty good though the crust had gotten a little bit soggy.There is ample seating and free wifi so it felt very warm and welcoming. \u00a0They let me sit and read my book while I slowly enjoyed my juice and quiche and were in no rush for me to leave, which I really appreciated. \u00a0If I'm in the area I would definitely return again! \u00a0Bonus points for them accepting credit card.",
