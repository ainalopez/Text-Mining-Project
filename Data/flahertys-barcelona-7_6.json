    "Super friendly staff. Paul was great, he made good recommendations and was extremely entertaining. We just came for drinks. Me and a friend ordered vodka sodas- this has to be the best vodka soda I've ever had (brand name is Eristoff). My friend who also had a vodka soda also thought it was delicious and she never drinks vodka sodas.We didn't get food, but I'm sure it's just as good.",
