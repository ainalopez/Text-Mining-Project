    "Probably has the best paella. Period. I've had a couple of paellas in my life. Actually, let me rephrase that- I THOUGHT I had several paellas in my life, but clearly my previous experiences with paella were nothing but lies- to call the cheapo rice dishes I've ingested \"paella\" no longer seems appriopriate in light of what I've eaten at Basque Palermo.My experience with paella isn't extensive. That said, this place came to me by the recommendation of a Barcelona native, one with extensive familiarity with Barcelona food and culture. It also helps that the location isn't exactly in tourist city, and the workers all are unaccustomed to the English language.I'll get right to the paella; this dish was about a rich and brimming with flavor. The flavor of the seafood stands out brightly in the midst of the dish, and bits of perfectly cooked seafood stud the rice dish, making each bite a flavorful surprise. If you love seafood or you want to try great paella, I can't recommend this place highly enough.",
