    "Absolutely amazing authentic Argentinian restaurant with very friendly staff. We didn't book the table and we were kind of lucky to get one. Definitely I suggest to book it. We were seated to by a very friendly hostess. Their waiter was nice and helpful as well. Really politely and knowingly described their steaks. Wines r very well selected. I found there one of my favorite Malbec. (: We chose beef carpaccio and ceviche for the starters. Both of them were more then delicious. Our sirloin steaks with baked potatoes after were incredible amazing and the taste .. heaven in our mouth! Tasty, grilled and juicy. After meal they gave us two alcohol sorbet cocktails on the house - really nice. It's a great place for gathering as well as romantic dinner. I can highly recommend.",
