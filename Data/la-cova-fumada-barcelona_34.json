    "A note of interest: we were told point blank by the awful man behind the bar that he would not serve someone who spoke English. \u00a0This is Catalonia, I am Catalan, etc. Mind you, we did not speak English to him, just to each other. \u00a0The locals nearby were stunned at his attitude. \u00a0I politely attempted to order from him in Spanish, his mind was made up. \u00a0Unless you can pull off passing as a local, I highly suggest that you dine elsewhere. \u00a0There is no signage on the establishment, just the street number. \u00a0Perhaps this helps with the locals only policy. \u00a0The food looked good.",
