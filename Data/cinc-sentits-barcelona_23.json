    "I just returned from hosting customers at Cinc Sentits. \u00a0Our group travels internationally, and is accustomed to fine dining. \u00a0This restaurant exceeded expectations (high to begin with) in taste, pairings, presentation, variety, experience. Cinc Sintis is a family owned business, adding to the charm. \u00a0We all had our iPhones out to take pictures of the food that is presented as a piece of art. \u00a0And every course was exquisite. \u00a0Cinc Sentits is a must for an exquisite experience. Thank you yelpers for the recommendation.",
