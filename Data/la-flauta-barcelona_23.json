    "My husband and I ordered a few things to start as well as some baguette sandwiches, which were great. Our service was quick to start, but then we waited for 15-20 minutes (with our entire table cleared of food or drink before we could finally get the attention of a service member to get our check then waited another 6 minutes for that. Food was great. Atmosphere is clean and social. Service needs work, otherwise I would have given 4 stars. Didn't blow me out of the water, but it was a good time. Establishment is 2 floors. You pay down stairs. Dress is casual, but not too casual.",
