    "The best brunch I have ever had. We originally went to Brunch&Cake, where there was a 30 minute wait. The waitress said to walk down 5 blocks to find this place that was exactly the same with no wait. She was spot on, and I felt more relaxed here because I didn't feel like someone was waiting for me to leave. I wish now I would have gone for something sweet rather than savory, because that seems to be what they do best. No regrets on my eggs and bagel, though. The eggs Benedict with turkey on a waffle was the best dish we got. The waffle had almost like whole granules of sugar...so sweet and crunchy and delicious! The service was nice and happy that we were there! The food came out quickly and the iced coffee was sweet and refreshing!",
