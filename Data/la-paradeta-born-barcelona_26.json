    "This restaurant has a very interesting concept where you point to what seafood you want, how much of it you want and then how to prepare it. The restaurant is cafeteria-casual where you go up to the counter to pick up your seafood when your number is called. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience of being able to pick out what we were going to eat for dinner that night and everything that we ordered was extremely fresh. The standout dishes of the evening were the whole crab with roe and salad, fresh fried calamari (North Americans, we don't know what we have been missing out on! Freshly made calamari has so much flavor and you can actually taste the calamari instead of just the batter), and the grilled baby octopus and squid. There are three locations in Barcelona and we frequented the one that is very close to the Sagrada Familia - I would recommend coming here after spending time at the church!",
