    "Their cheesecake is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had, and I'm not a super fan of cheesecakes. It was light and airy and not too dense. The crust was perfect, not too thick and it had se kind of nut ground in it. It held the body of the cake very well. The best part of it was the praline topping. SO GOOD!!",
