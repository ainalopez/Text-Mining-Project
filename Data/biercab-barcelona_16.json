    "Doesn't get better than this!  \u00a0The beer selection is phenomenal and the food is amazing. Food is mostly a twist on traditional spanish tapas, but much, much better in my opinion. The service is great. Everyone is always there to help you with whatever you need. They also have good taste in music. \u00a0Manolo, the regular bartender and one of the owners, is always so happy and pumped up.  \u00a0They are about quality with everything, so you won't get any bad beers and even if you did they would kindly replace it for you. They also have an amazing bottle selection primarily comprised of hard to get lambics with a few new world beers as well. \u00a0I like to go earlier in the week so its not to crowded and can talk to the staff a bit. You also get a nice mix of people from all over the world. If you're in Barcelona and love beer, this place is a must!",
