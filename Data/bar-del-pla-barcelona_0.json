    "Really nice authentic location, with great tapas - I strongly suggest the Ham and chicken croquettes and also the crispy beef with foie gras, absolutely delicious !Really nice tapas bar to visit if you are around El BornI would suggest to call ahead to reserve a table and maybe go around 8 to enjoy a quieter dinner",
