    "Opened recently in a quite huge former 1870's textile factory, it shelters four bars and four restaurants: La Braseria for grilled and a la plancha meats, La Paradeta for the seafood, La Llotja for fish in all its forms and La Taperia for tapas and rices. In an atmosphere of super design one can dine or stay in one of the four bars which offer tapas if one wants to eat more slightly and have a drink from a selection of cocktails, beers, cava, wines.We visited several of the restaurants and every time, we were surprised by quality and ambiance.It is a must, visiting BCN, to come here, at least, once (and afterwards, it will be probably more often!)",
