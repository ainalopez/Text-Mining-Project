    "Sister restaurant to Cera 23 - I really loved my dinner here. \u00a0We were a group of 5 and all shared a variety of plates. \u00a0Actually, Injae K has the details - go check out his review... by reading his review, I was able to relive the memories. \u00a0Now I'm hungry again. \u00a0And yes, at 30 Euros each - the meal was totally affordable considering how much we ordered (and drank). \u00a0My personal favorite was the duck paella. \u00a0Great service, too.",
