    "This place it's kind of hidden. I went there with my cousin when we were visiting Barcelona for three days. We ended up going there twice. The first time I had a decent burger and as I was served the burger I was reminded to make sure to check out their pasta. As we were eating they brought us two samples of their pasta and then I knew what he was talking about. Two days later we went there again and went for the pasta.it is freshly made and it tastes delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant specially because of their pasta. Will go back next time I'm in Barcelona!",
