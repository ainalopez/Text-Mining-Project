    "That beef. That delicious, succulent beef. I came for lunch at 1PM on a Tuesday. No line, lots of seats at the bar, and it seemed like a mild lunchtime crowd. No complaints there.I proceeded to sit at the bar in front of a man I can only describe as looking like my grandfather (which is a good thing). Off to a great start. To avoid any mistranslated words (and to save on time - I was hungry, OK?) I opted for the English menu.My order:1. To drink - beer with fanta (thanks to the poster down there who suggested it). You can ask for \"clara con limon.\" And no, it's not orange fanta - it's lemon-flavoured which makes it soooo refreshing.2. To eat - I had the solomillo con pimientos (sirloin/beef with the pedron peppers). I was tempted to go for the foie but seeing as I was alone and felt like \"eating light\" (ha!) The peppers seemed like a better choice. And boy, was I right. I had the \"un poco\" under \"a punto\" (sorry for buchering the Spanish but I asked for it medium rare). Although they give you these random hacked up pieces it's actually so much better because each bite-sized piece gets some sear and is just that - a perfect bite. The peppers are not hot at all though I wish they were, but they come fried and slick with olive oil, perfect to be mopped up by the complimentary bread the provide up front.I'll save you the melodrama about how delicious it was, but I wish I came with the rest of my group just so I could try everything else on the menu.",
