    "Went here for lunch on our last day in Barcelona. We arrived early in the afternoon to beat the lunch crowd (although it got crowded quickly).The waiter was very nice and explained the fixed menu (menu del dia) to us. This was a good deal where you get a drink, entree, and dessert for 10,90 euros. We started off with a Tunisian salad that had a mix of greens and pieces of beef. It was good, but the only problem was that the beef was practically raw. \u00a0We then both had a \"brick\", which was an empanada with vegetables inside of it. It was good and came with some salsa that was pretty tasty.For dessert, my fiancee had a latte and I had peach compost with some crumbs on it. She found the latte to be delicious and I found the peach compost to be very good as well.Given how crowded it got, it took a while to get the waiter's attention so that we could get the bill. Otherwise, the service was pretty good.If you want a good and affordable lunch, this is a good spot for you.",
