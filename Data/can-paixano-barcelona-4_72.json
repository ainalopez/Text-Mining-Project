    "\u00a1Que Rico! This place is the SPOT! Wait in line if you have to, but spend time inside indulging in delicious Catalunyan street fare fairly priced and supremely delicious. Their Cala is sweet and made in house and you can drink it by the bottle (watch out, it's 10% alcohol by volume - it catches up). From sausage to a sandwich, foi gras to ham, this is a must stop for anyone's stay in Barcelona.",
