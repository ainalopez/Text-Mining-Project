    "The GPS said we had arrived but it looked like a construction zone. We ended up circling the streets a couple off times before we finally decided to get off our Vespa and follow the GPS signal on foot. I was highly doubtful of the GPS as no other businesses nearby were open. But lo and behold, there was a door with people spilling out of it.Can Paixano was a place I had read on Yelp, in guidebooks, and was recommended to us by the Vespa rental company. I figured you can't go wrong with that many recommendations. This place is a total meat fest. We had some sort of sandwich and then a whole plate full of sausages. We washed those down with a very inexpensive bottle of cava.We were giggling on our way out. We hopped back onto the Vespa (yes, very safe), and headed to our next destination.",
