    "Who flies to Barcelona and eats sushi? I know. What a nutter. But sometimes you just want sushi, and you are in Barcelona, and it is kind of like tapas in a way, so there you go. This place is great and the service is excellent. The special makis are the way to go, they are amazing. I would definitely go back.",
