    "Simply the best Thai I have ever had!!!! I went with a party of 6 on a Friday. We made reservations and were seated on time. I do not know much about Thai cuisine so I let the others in my party order. There was not a bad dish on the menu. It's a small restaurant , seats about 20, and reservations are a must. The staff was friendly and TRI-lingual, we all spoke Spanish but it helped to have the English options.The restaurant is very cozy and service was good. I was shocked by the price in a good way. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",
