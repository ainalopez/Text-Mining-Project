    "Seriously Barcelona gets better every night we are here! \u00a0We struck out around the corner and walked into the nicest Tapas bar in town. \u00a0Both hostesses were so charming. \u00a0We were a party of five and had to wait about 40 minutes. \u00a0They walked us down the block to another bar and said they would come and get us. \u00a0She even checked in with us a couple times! \u00a0Our waitress on arrival reviewed the menu and gave suggestions, in English too. \u00a0We had Watermelon Goat cheese beet salad, Bravos, beef skewers, asparagus, spicy red shrimp, more bravos and a couple of their sandwiches. \u00a0Everything was perfect and the beet salad was super perfect.",
