    "Ate here our first night in Barcelona. We were staying in the area and wanted to stay in the neighborhood. Not a big place, but they fit you in somehow. The house wine is from a tap in the wall and is good for 3.75\u20ac a jug!! We had the baby octopus, sirloin steak and then the sausage. I would recommend for sure to get the octopus!!",
