    "Just a few minutes off the Rambla, an inexpensive and delicious lunch (or late night) option: a twist on the stuffed crepe model, except the fillings are housed into crunchy/fluffy cornmeal (gluten free!) arepas. Ranging from the Noruega with salmon to the Griega with feta and olives, the arepas are fresh out of the oven and delicious, especially with a dollop of homemade guacamole or a generous helping of salsa picante. You can also get a sampler menu of 4 mini arepas, if you can't decide. A simple, friendly place with great vegetarian options!",
