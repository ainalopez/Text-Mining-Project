    "It's a testament when they have 2 different locations within walking distance at the market. \u00a0Prefer this one if you want less action but still busy anyways. \u00a0As usual, it's first come, first serve so be smart and watch for the seats that are either ordering dessert, or asking for the bill, there's no wait list like the Kiosk Universal.Anyways, ordered the usual tapas: \u00a0razor clams and some big shrimp. \u00a0Clams were great, shrimp while good, but Kiosk much better and moist.In terms of hygiene, I liked how they covered their food with plastic, as per pic. \u00a0There were too many bees/flies in the market for my liking.Ppl talk about high prices, sure, but hey, this is a touristy area though lots of locals here too.It's a place of action.",
