    "I have eaten at El Atril three times over the past month (two lunches and one dinner). \u00a0It was wonderful each time. \u00a0For lunch, I sat outside and had the menu of the day. \u00a0The last visit I had a mussels appetizer. \u00a0The broth was so good I soaked all my bread in it. \u00a0The main course was bonita with vegetables. \u00a0Excellent. \u00a0The little square where they serve outdoors is pleasant and I was entertained by two different street performances, one a dance and the other music. \u00a0At dinner, we sat inside and sampled a number of tapas. \u00a0There is a very good variety in the menu and the service was attentive.",
