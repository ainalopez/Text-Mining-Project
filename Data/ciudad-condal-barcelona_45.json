    "We had to wait for 30 minutes at 1:30pm to get a seat. Totally wait the wait though. I was here 2 years ago and I knew I had to come back again. The flow of traffic is constant at this place and people are willing to wait up to 45 minutes. The tapas come as they are made, so don't expect all your dishes to arrive at the same time. Ended the meal with desserts...probably a little too sweet, but heck, it's a dessert! If you are in town and have some time and not starving (because you have to wait and stare at the tapas displayed at the bar), then this place deserves your patronage.",
