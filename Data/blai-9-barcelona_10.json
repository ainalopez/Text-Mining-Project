    "This place is the best place for tapas!! I stumbled upon this place, and I recalled my airbnb host recommending this place to me, so I decided to go in, which ended up being the best decision of my night!!The sangria is AMAZING and all of the tapas are so tasty!! It was 1\u20ac for the clear plate tapas and 1.5\u20ac for the black plate tapas. My boyfriend and I shared 1/2 liters of sangria and 18ish plates and it came to a total of 27\u20ac, which isn't bad split between 2 people and extremely filling!I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic tasty tapas in a relaxed environment, and delicious sangria :)",
