    "Probably the best meal we had in Barcelona. \u00a0All the tapas here were delicious.. the one that stuck out was the Razor clams... what I would give to have those again right now.The waiter was very helpful and spoke English. \u00a0He recommended a lot of things and they were all great so I would definitely trust their input here. \u00a0The desserts looked delicious, but were not anything special.... \u00a0I won't let that take away from the great meal we had here though.The wait on a thursday night when arriving at 8:30 was about 45 minutes, so it wasn't too bad. \u00a0They also have outdoor seating but I'd say sitting inside is worth it for the decoration and overall experience.",
