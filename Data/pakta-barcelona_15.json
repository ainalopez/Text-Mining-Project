    "Where on Earth am I supposed to eat after Pakta? When will I be hungry again? All rhetorical questions, of course.By some undeserved miracle, I was able to make same-day reservations to Pakta. I'm under the impression that others have made reservations for months in advance. I'm visiting Barcelona for 1 week, and tonight was the only night they had a table available.The website is thorough in explaining what to expect and the rest is left up to them. I made a free reservation for 2 at 8pm. I was explained (in an email) that dinner would last 2 - 2 1/2 hours, and would be about 25 courses.We chose the Fujiyama menu (90 Euros, which is the \"shorter\" menu) and I added the sake tasting to my meal (an additional 48 Euros).I have no words to describe the entire experience. The entire dinner was a calculated symphony. Approximately 32 people are served nightly, started at 7pm, and the last service being at 10pm. Pakta has been open for nearly 3 months now, the newest creation of the Adria brothers.Service is incredibly professional, flawless, and completely welcoming. A restaurant of this caliber, one could expect a level of stuffiness that can overpower the meal itself, but fortunately is cast aside, as diners fill the air with questions and compliments.Describing each course would not do it justice, so that just leaves me with telling you that it will be an unforgettable meal. All details have been meticulously calculated so you forget you're in a restaurant. I'd advise you check the website before making a reservation, as sometimes they require a 50 Euro deposit when you make the reservation. Also, you'll get an email or phone call asking if you have any allergies or food intolerances so they can make accommodations (not for vegans).",
