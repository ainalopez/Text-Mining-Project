    "This is a nikkei restaurant by well known chef Alberto Adria who is brother of Ferran Adria, owner of now the legendary Spanish restaurant el Bulli. \u00a0Besides him restaurant is run by 2 other head chefs, Japanese girl and Peruvian guy. This place is amazing! Everything from atmosphere, \u00a0presentation and customer service. It was one of the expensive meal I had but was worth every penny. \u00a0Our waitress explained very well about each dish and as always, Japanese food heavily emphasize on the presentation and color, these dishes tasted just as good as they looked. Traditional Japanese food does not have a strong flavors but more sensational and delicate flavors, these dishes had touch and little kick of Peruvian cuisine which goes well. If you are looking to have a great dining experience and willing to splurge, this is a place.",
