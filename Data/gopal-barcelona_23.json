    "Absolutely amazing place! As a vegetarian in Barcelona good food was a little hard to come by but this place really hooked it up! I ordered the menu 1 with veggie burger and fries, along with a cola. The food is simply amazing, fries better than I've ever had and the sauces on the burger really turned it up a notch! Lastly, I topped it off with one of their chocolate donuts. Absolute heaven, I swear. Just happiness in my mouth. In my top 5 restaurants I've ever been to, easily!",
