    "Came back a second time and had a much better experience. Ordered the salad platter, mini hamburger, squid, and huevos cabreaos (eggs on fries with garlic sauce) and all were good. In particular, the salad platter and the egg fries were outstanding.Be prepared to have the fastest dinner of your life. Service is extremely fast, the server had come by 4 times before we were ready to order. Food came out in a flash as well. Overall a nice place to grab a quick dinner.",
