    "BlackLab is like a little oasis for English-speaking beer and lounge lovers in the heart of Barcelona right by the harbor. It is still fairly new and only brews two beers at the moment: the amber rye and dry stout. The owner graciously let us sample both at the bar. The dry stout was really bitter for my taste, and the amber rye was more bearable for the non-beer drinker in me. We ended up picking a guest brew on tap though.There's plenty of space to the left and right of the main foyer. They also have a rather diverse menu, ranging from banh mi to your typical sandwiches and salads. I believe the owner, with Asian roots, also used to live in Chicago. The whole place feels neat and hip; I can only see it grow substantially as more and more international travelers and internationally minded locals stream through the area.",
