    "This place is an absolute delight. The food was stellar, the people friendly, and the atmosphere intimate/relaxed. What more could you want? We are from San Francisco and we know what good food is. This food rocks. The only thing that I regret about posting this review is that the place may get too crowded: otherwise, I would only say that this place is a real gem.",
