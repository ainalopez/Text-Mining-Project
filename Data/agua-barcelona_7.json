    "Had dinner here tonight with co-workers. \u00a0English menu provided. \u00a0Restaurant is gorgeous! \u00a0 Service was prompt and efficient. \u00a0We had Iberia ham, toasts with tomato jam, fried artichokes, amazing cheese risotto (yum!) for small plates. \u00a0Then dinner was monkfish and salmon. \u00a0We shared a bottle of red wine, total bill ~140 euros for three. \u00a0This restaurant is located in a great area on the beach and near nightclubs. \u00a0Taxis frequent this area, so easy to find a ride back to hotel. \u00a0Definitely recommend.",
