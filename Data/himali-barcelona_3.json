    "A wonderful break from the jamon and white bread all over Barcelona! We were greeted in perfect English by the charming waitress/daughter who made our experience a joy. DELICIOUS Nepali/Indian food! We had the Saag with Beef curry and the Chicken and Potato curry. Both were excellent and came with rice AND naan included. Anyone looking for some great South Asian cuisine should make sure that Himali is on their list for their time in Barcelona!",
