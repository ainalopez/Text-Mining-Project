    "Barcelona Tapas at their finest. \u00a0While on our honeymoon, we walked into Sensi around 2230 and it was completely full, but one of the servers asked us to wait and have a drink and she asked if were okay for us to sit at the bar which we were fine with! \u00a0The tuna tartare was probably one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten! \u00a0The seafood paella was perfect! \u00a0The ravioli was creamy and flavorful. \u00a0Dimly lit, romantic ambiance, delicious house wine, excellent service, would love to go back! \u00a0Reservations are highly recommended!!",
