    "So good. Had around 10 courses here. The vermouth is a nice touch to start off with. The jamon is great. The \"olives\" lived up to the hype. Two of my faves from the night were: artichoke heart draped in a sardine. Salty and smooth. And also their take on a chicharron - fried pork belly up to the skin with a spicy powder dusting. So good. What made this night even more special was that both Ferran and Albert were seated at the table next to us. Pretty amazing experience.",
