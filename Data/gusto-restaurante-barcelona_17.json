    "Nice little Italian restaurant, which is convenienty located within walking distance from the Hospital Clinic metro station. \u00a0We started with the Carpaccio Classico, which was excellent. \u00a0Thinly sliced beef carpaccio, topped with arugula, shaved Parmesan, and a freshly squeezed lemon.The Panzerotti Con Riccota E Funghi Porcini pasta was delicious, with riccota cheese stuffed pasta bathing in a rich mushroom filled sauce. \u00a0But my favorite was definitely the Pizza Margherita. \u00a0The crust was something amazing - thin and chewy, yet light and airy, with a nice char from the brick wood fire oven (which you can see right when you walk through the doors).I highly recommend the pizza here, plus the food and the house Pinot Grigio are reasonably priced. \u00a0Eat up!",
