    "Christmas 2015 dinner.. Our first actual outing from arrival. Came here with the family. My cousin reserved us a table since we were a big party of 6 just in case. The place from the outside looks small with just a entrance. Then as soon as you go in it's like wow big well bigger than expected.We ordered our drinks. I didn't know they don't have tap water. I forget it's not a norm here. These are the little things I have to get use to. We ordered 8 dishes. Which were very good. Minus one of the noodle dish. It was the spicy noodle it was missing something. Maybe more ground meat or just more meat. It wasn't bad but I doubt I will order it again. The two dumplings were good. Different texture on the prawn one. Outside was a bit more sticky. My peanut noodle dish was very good. That I would go back and get again. The tofu century egg was not what we originally ordered but we kept it anyways. \u00a0It wasn't bad but I think it would have been good as a warm dish. I didn't get to taste the chicken dish but my cousin in law said it was good. Of course the century egg dish was good. It had some pig ear mushrooms with it. This place also serves shabu shabu over \u20ac20. Not bad. Bathroom is clean. Place is clean and they also have WIFI. Street parking.So all in all my Christmas dinner was Delish. But the company made it even better..",
