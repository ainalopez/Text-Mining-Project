    "Exceptional value for a great meal. The food was outrageously good. \u00a0We selected the menu del dia. It was an exceptional value. For 10 euros you got a three course meal and it wasn't fast food. It was a solid quality meal and I intend to return for more before the end of this trip. I highly recommend.",
