    "We ate seafood paella and it was burnt (not that cool burnt in the bottom of the pot burnt, the shrimp was black burnt) giving it a smoked flavor, rice was undone. Also had some tapas: camembert (it tasted and had the filo texture more like goat cheese) and the fried squid which were ok. I chose the place based on previous (very good Yelp reviews) just because we had just gotten back from a long trip and starving on a Sunday afternoon, when not all businesses were opened. Service...not that great either. Certainly will not repeat.",
