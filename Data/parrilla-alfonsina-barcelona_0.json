    "So we dined here on July 19th, 2015. \u00a0To be honest, I'm still unsure if where we dined is the same restaurant that everyone else has reviewed. \u00a0We ended up at the address that Yelp lists, and there is an restaurant with just the name \"Alfonsina\" on the outside and on their menu. \u00a0We walked in and I kept comparing the Yelp pics with the surroundings and while structurally, they matched up, there were notable differences - e.g., no tile floors / instead wood floors, and brick walls, but fully bricked, instead of the part-brick/part-stucco that's in one of the pics. \u00a0But like the reviews say, there's a teeny-tiny bar area when you first walk in, but opens up to a nice-sized restaurant at the back. \u00a0So we stood around looking like confused idiots and finally asked if this was an Argentinean steakhouse and when the hostess replied \"Ci\", we just decided to go with it. \u00a0We are 99.99% sure this restaurant changed ownership recently. \u00a0They are still an Argentinean steakhouse, but the website that's linked in Yelp is not accurate and does not belong to the Alfonsina we ate at (which is probably why I didn't receive an email or text confirmation when I made a reservation online...) - So finally, on to the review!The menu seems to be VERY similar to what was offered before. \u00a0We had the pleasure of being waited on by (I believe) the owner, and while he spoke little English, we managed well - He was a true and complete delight! \u00a0He even warned us when he felt like we were ordering too much food, which he would have been spot-on about. \u00a0Unlike the old restaurant, this one does not serve pasta, but they have a grilled veggie started that's HUGE and DELICIOUS, so I ordered this - Comes with grilled eggplant, sweet potato, zucchini, asparagus, and a couple of baby potatoes. \u00a0The hubby ordered the rib eye, medium-rare. \u00a0We also partook in a lovely bottle of Malbec. \u00a0You will receive complimentary rolls and chimichurri sauce. \u00a0The chimichurri sauce is to die for good, and combine it with the soft, dinner rolls (a very nice break from all the hard breads) - You will be in heaven. \u00a0Hubby reports his ribeye was extremely good (he ate all of it, which is rare) - and stated while the the meat was more 4-star worthy, the service we received makes it a 5-star experience. \u00a0We also ended up ordering the tiramisu - While it was tasty, I think it was a store-bought brand that had been de-thawed a bit too much - the bottom layer was soaked with water.So while this may not be the Argentinean steakhouse of previous reviews, you should absolutely make it a point to check it out! \u00a0And if you're worried about a vegetarian dining companion, don't be - Their grilled veggie plate will leave them stuffed and smiling.",
