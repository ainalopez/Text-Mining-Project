    "Nicely decorated bar with many options to eat and drink (whether you are vegan, vegetarian or just want to have something healthy). The staff is really kind, if you have any question or doubt just ask them and they will help you. Plus, during the time I stayed inside, they played almost the entire Beyonc\u00e9's discography which made me enjoy my meal even more (but I guess this is just irrelevant for those who are not so big fan of her...).",
