    "We stopped in at Pizza Paco for an early evening pizza for dinner one night during our visit to Barcelona. When it is sunny there are tables outside and that is where we sat for our meal. It is a good spot with lots going on that allows you to people watch to the max. There is plenty of musicians, dog walkers, skateboarders, etc, going by to keep you amused. The pizza itself was good. Thin based and huge. (One to share between two was fine for us) We had the chorizo and onion as you can see from the picture it is fairly standard stuff, but sometimes that's all you want from a pizza I think. Tasted good and filled us up. One small criticism would be the service. It was a bit slow with the waitress more interested in chatting to her friends or eating her pizza that making sure we were happy with ours. In general though, it did not impact massively on our experience. So good pizza in a nice spot - 3 stars.",
