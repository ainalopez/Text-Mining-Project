    "So far, the best food I've had in Barcelona. Heck, maybe even all of my trip during Spain! The seating is very cute, with nice tables outside and inside. The food itself is all massive portions with amazing flavour. The type of food is quite American - we had the fruit pancakes and I had the chicken super sandwich, which is pretty much this massive chicken salad sandwich with mayo, mushrooms, peppers, onions all in bread - AND with salad and potatoes on the side. It tasted phenomenal - definitely reminded me of good old fashioned food back home. I would recommend this place to anyone for a satisfying brunch; I came here for breakfast and was full all the way till dinner (and I have quite a big appetite). We also ordered the scrambled eggs with bacon and mushroom, with an amazing bagel, avocado and spinach sandwich on the side. I didn't enjoy it as much as the super sandwich, but it was still quite tasty. If you are looking for a very fairly priced place for breakfast or lunch, you do NOT want to miss this!",
