    "we were planning to have dinner at cera 23 but we did not make a reservation so we could not get a table. however, the owner told us that he owns another place around the corner and personally escorted us to arume. the owner and the staff in arume are so friendly and accommodating that our dinner experience was even better. we ordered the lamb, vulcano black rice, scallops---all were very tasty and delcious. we also tried their blackberry mojito and tempranillo which was so good and went well with the food we ordered. we then tried the desserts: fruits with gin and flan, also very yummy! i highly recommemd trying this place. it is well worth your time and money. btw for the deliciousness of your meal the price is cheap in comparison to other places that would be marked as \"2\u20ac\u20ac\" on yelp.",
