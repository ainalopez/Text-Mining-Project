    "We had a great dinner here! We had to wait for a table, but it was only about 15 minutes, and there was wifi! A great thing when you're traveling abroad. We sat for quite a while with the menu, but it was in English, which was very helpful. We ordered a bread basket to share, and that was quite a treat, since it came with several different kinds of bread to try. My husband ordered the pappardellisimi, and it was delicious. Honestly, it was better than any pasta we had in Italy. I ordered the goat cheese salad, and it was also amazing. The honey vinaigrette dressing was perfect, and added just a little bit of sweetness. The goat cheese was warm, and served on top of a toasted bread round. All of the other ingredients worked together beautifully. Overall, it was a delightful meal, and was definitely one of the highlights of our 9 country European tour!",
