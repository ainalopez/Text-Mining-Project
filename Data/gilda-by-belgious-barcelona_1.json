    "Barcelona has a TON of tapas bars, and if you are anywhere in or around the old city, you will be inundated with them. The area that Gilda is in is known for having great tapas, and the restaurants here run the gauntlet from super modern to totally old school. Gilda is on the super modern side of the spectrum, both in atmosphere and food. Most of their dishes are Belgian and not Spanish, despite the tapas name. Even their classic Spanish dishes are not very classic; many of them have been tweaked quite a bit. You might or might not like this. Their prices are also pretty high, although some of their dishes are a good value. While the meal was somewhat enjoyable, we were mostly disappointed. We had:Fois Gras: Neither of us have ever had this dish before, and we don't ever plan to again. However, we had to try it once in our lifetimes, and the price was right for a small portion. This dish was very well done (although we didn't have other fois gras experiences to compare it to), and was the highlight of our experience here. Spinach Croquettes: Pretty good.Patatas Bravas: Woah, waaay too much going on here. Too many flavors hastily thrown together made for an un-enjoyable dish. We tried patatas bravas at every tapas place we went, and this was by far the worst. Don't get it.Catalan (Tomato) Bread: Way too many tomatoes, they overpowered the dish. Not enough of the other flavors that make this bread so great. Another pass.Wine: Very expensive and not a very good list. We were disappointed.Service: Very slow. Even for Spanish standards.There are better choices around.",
