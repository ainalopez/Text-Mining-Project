    "I came to this little place 10 years ago and it's not changed one bit! I'm not sure how to describe the decor exactly but it does make me think of a Greek hideout that could feature in a bond movie. It's simple but tasty fare, savory & sweet crepes and also great for brunch with various egg dishes and freshly squeezed juices. The only small thing I thought was a bit odd was being charged more for wholemeal bread when I requested it, it was just plain packet bread nothing fancy so made no sense to charge more. We came back in the nighttime too and I sampled one of their delicious Mojitos they pack a punch! the staff are friendly and attentive and everything is quite cheap in comparison to Las Ramblas or more touristy spots.",
