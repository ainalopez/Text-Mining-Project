    "We took a bike tour and the guide suggested this place and l'academie for seafood. \u00a0One is very fancy and formal, this one is literally a small, local place. \u00a0There were dirty dishes piled up on the counter... But don't be frightened. \u00a0The seafood was fresh and excellent. \u00a0It's family run by a couple, and the son was very friendly and joked around with us in English. \u00a0We had mussels, clams, and razor clams cooked in butter. \u00a0Plus, grilled shrimp. \u00a0Not much to say other than it was excellent. \u00a0It's a noisy, small place, but it was packed at lunchtime with old, salty locals that were all giving the son a good hazing in fun, and then what seemed like arguing/joking with the mother. \u00a0Go, enjoy the food!",
