    "Good change up from traditional Spanish food. The rice balls were very good and so was the chicken noodles dish. As the other reviews have said, it's not a traditional Vietnamese restaurant but it was very good as an Asian-fusion type place. Pretty good mojitos as well at a very good price (3.50). Overall a very good meal, got an appetizer, 2 drinks and 2 entrees for 25 euro! Definitely would go back.",
