    "We came here two nights our of our five night stay in Barcelona because we liked it so much! Upstairs, there \u00a0are hammock seats that we were lucky enough to get one night. The other night we got a comfy couch, which was also great. The drinks here are so good! \u00a0The sweet Ziryah is like a milkshake, so yummy. The waiters are all really nice and willing to give suggestions. There are a lot of hookah flavors to pick from and we liked all the ones we tried!",
