    "What is everyone talking about?!? the food at mosquito is inedible! Grossest 'Peking duck' (Anec fregit) I've ever had the displeasure of tasting. Whatever sauce that was, it was unlike any other Peking duck with hoisin sauce I've ever had, in a bad way. We couldn't eat it. I tried, I was starving.Vegetable dumplings?!? That's just shredded cabbage in there with a bit of scallions. Super boring, husband couldn't eat it, I ate it as the saddest second most edible item. Usually vegetable dumplings have mushrooms, bamboo shoots, tofu, scallions etc. Not here.I'll spare you the rest of the gory details and close with saying we also tried the pork dumplings - I'd give those a 3 as the best thing we could stand putting in our mouths. Avoid this place like the plague!! If you must go, I suggest ordering what we call Miami style - try 1-2 dishes max before investing in a full meal.",
