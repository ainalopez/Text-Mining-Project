    "Absolutely loved the place and the ambiance here. \u00a0My friends and I went here for Sunday lunch. From the outside this place looks like nothing to write home about, but wait don't turn back just head straight in. Once inside you will be welcomed by a cosy ambiance. There is plenty of seating with both table, bar and side counter seating. My advice try getting some seats at the bar if possible, simply because all the action is happening there. We got seated at the bar. So it is simple there is a bunch of raw produce on display in front of you, pick the ones you fancy and they will pick it in front of you and pass it to the kitchen to be prepared. We had the the ham iberica, the razor clams, the steak tartare, the peppered steak, the tuna served raw on a bed of olive oil and vinegar, the fried squid, glazed salted green peppers, potatos with a local white spicy sauce, the bread with tomato and olives. For the drinks we ordered the beer on the tap, cava sparkling white wine, and gin & tonic for the end of meal drink.From the above you have to try the razor clams, the steak tartare, the raw tuna and the peppered \u00a0steak.",
