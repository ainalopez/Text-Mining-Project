    "A small cozy bar that primarily serves pinchos. These are slices of bread with toppings like feta and fig, hams, salamis, salmon, etc. I particularly liked the roquefort with quince. Inexpensive, you order several. They have a few larger items (Tapas sized) like flank steak that was delicious. Put together lots of flavors and make a meal. Everything was delicious. \u00a0It ends up being a very reasonably priced dinner.",
