    "It's a famous restaurant...oldest in the city? Country? Anyway...the ambiance is fun, the service was great but the food is mediocre. Paella is so salty...good seafood flavor but the rice was overlooked, no crunchy (best part in my opinion) parts on the bottom either. It's as if they scooped in a pre-made paella and didn't even try to pretend it was made to order. And it took a long time for it to come out!",
