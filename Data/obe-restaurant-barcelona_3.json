    "I walked by this place earlier in the day, the menu looked good so I went back for dinner. The service was fantastic. They offered us a artichoke risotto ball compliments of the chef which was delicious. We had the pappardelle lamb ragout and the pork shank. But prepared perfectly. For dessert we had the chocolate torte with pistachio ice cream. Absolutely to die for. I highly recommend this restaurant.",
