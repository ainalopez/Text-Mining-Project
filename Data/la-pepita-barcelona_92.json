    "Amazing food, even better staff! Arrived after an early flight for a quick breakfast of iberico ham and tomato bread washed down with a coffee. Been told the Gin and Tonic's are amazing as well. The next day we had lunch and ordered half the tapas menu, the seabass and foie gras with chocolate were exceptional. The staff were very accommodating as more and more people arrived in our group until we were about 10 strong. After food they lead us to a bar 2 doors down La Cava(same owners I think) where we continued the liquid refreshments.",
