    "I came here thanks to all the positive reviews on Yelp:) I was here on my own for a weekday lunch and there were lots of other women doing the same. They have newspapers and magazines at the front, plus free wifi, so there's stuff to do if you're alone. I loved the clean, laid-back atmosphere. It's sort of cozy and rustic with white walls and checkered details. The menu has lots of delicious veggie dishes, which I was craving after eating a lot of meat and seafood since being here. Their salad was delicious with perfectly ripe avocados and a creamy peanut-y dressing. For the main course, I had a vegetable rice dish which was served with huge onion rings on top. The portion was filling and it felt super-satisfying to be eating all those vegetables! Service was polite and attentive. There's an open kitchen at the front and it looks like they have some delicious baked goods, but I didn't try any. I would definitely come back next time I visit BCN.",
