    "I decided to try this place after reading all of the positive reviews. I came in on a Thursday around 1:30pm and it was packed! But wait wasn't too bad, about 10 min. The waitress came by and I ordered the Toasted Coconut bread. After about 10 minutes, she came back and asked me again what I would like to order. I paused and told her I had already ordered. She smiled and said \"ok, you wait.\" And I waited indeed. Clearly, she forgot to put the order in, since it took over 15 minutes to bring out baked bread!Luckily the food saved this review because it was pretty good, although they were very stingy with the pear topping (see photo). The coconut bread comes with two generous slices of coconut bread sitting in a puddle of \"cheese cream\" which is sweet. There's also poached pears and graham dust on top. Very good!From 1-10 with 10 being the highest:-food ( I got the toasted coconut bread): 9- cleanliness: 10-service: 6-price: 7.5 (my dish was about \u20ac5)If you are in town, come check this place out.",
