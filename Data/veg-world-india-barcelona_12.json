    "Very awesum place in barcelona to eat authentic Indian food pure vegetarian. With 5 types of Indian Salsa and free papad (A traditional) crispy thin. The owner was was very friendly to us asking if we liked the food or not. Offerd us special indian tea. Although is a very small restaurant its worth a try. I go there whenever I am in barcelona. Also my Indian friends loved it. If you live in barcelona and havent been there you missed the taste. Price is also very reasonable as comapred to other fancy \u00a0places with have good decor but pathetic indian food. Totally recommended by Indians!!!",
