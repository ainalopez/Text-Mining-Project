    "Fantastic restaurant serving interesting, traditional Catalan food. \u00a0Most of the other places I got to in Barcelona were of the tapas variety and had mostly all the same dishes. \u00a0I'm no expert but many of the dishes on the menu looked quite authentic to me (e.g. Catalan spinach with raisins, pine nuts, and ham; Catalan-style cannelloni; roast duck with prunes) and some other unique dishes that may or may not be Catalan, such as smoked salmon and kiwi salad (which was fantastic), and whiskey tart. \u00a0The price was great for the amount of food we got. \u00a0All four of us thoroughly enjoyed everything they put in front of us, including wine and dessert. \u00a0The waitress were all older women and the place is quite old, making it feel kind of like eating at grandmas house - +1 for decor :)",
