    "Quite simply one of the best meals I had in Spain. \u00a0Part of it is the vibe, in the center of la Boqueria you're surrounded by fresh food, the sights, smells, sounds- it's food sensory overload. \u00a0The bustling atmosphere makes getting to el quim part of the challenge- after taking the time to stake out a seat or two your meal just tastes better. \u00a0Los callos del quim (tripe) was one of the best meals I had in Spain, a delicious rich, savory breakfast. \u00a0The rabbit (el conejo) was also quite good but not spectacular. \u00a0This place is a real gem, if a little expensive. \u00a0But suck it up and pay because it's worth it.",
