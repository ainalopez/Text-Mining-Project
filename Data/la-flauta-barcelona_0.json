    "The tapas were definitely one of the better ones I've had after living in Barcelona for 4 months. We got there around 9 and quickly grabbed the remaining bar seats, and within 10 minutes there were already a huge line out the door. Still, this place didn't seem to be as touristy as some other tapas restaurants. I ordered a bunch of food that I thought looked good on previous Yelp reviews, and the man at the bar (bartender? Server? Not sure) was very helpful in helping me identify the food I wanted from the photos. Every dish I got was very tasty - especially the fried eggs on ham and fries. Overall great atmosphere and service.",
