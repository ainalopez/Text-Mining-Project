    "My wife, daughter and I made reservations for dinner specifically because they both are gluten allergic and are very careful with their diets. While I am gluten tolerate we have a difficult time finding restaurants that we all enjoy. Well, En ville more than exceeded our expectations. \u00a0The atmosphere is very nice but welcoming, being off the more traditional tourist routes. The staff speaks English and is very accommodating of all of our requests. The food is superb with a nice range of beef, seafood and pasta all gluten free. I found my gluten free scallops and pea foam dish beautifully prepared and delicious. My daughter had a craving for a hamburger and fries and thoroughly enjoyed her meal. My wife had risotto which she loved. The desert menu was vast and we all enjoyed the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Would highly recommend this restaurant to all.",
