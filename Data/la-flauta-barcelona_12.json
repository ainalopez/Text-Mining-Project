    "We were brought to Flauta by some friends who live in Valencia. We absolutely loved the meal we had. Definitely would recommend getting there early as the place was absolutely packed. My friend called ahead and put her name on the list yet we still waited about 20mins once our whole party was there. They do have a bar in the entrance so you can enjoy a drink while you wait. Probably the best food we've had since in Spain. Would highly recommend the grilled squid, grilled octopus, fried potatoes with a fried egg(can't remember that name), and filet medallions. We've been in Spain for a while and haven't seen steak in many places. The filet medallions hit the spot.",
