    "Came here on my first day in Barcelona for lunch, per the recommendation of the hotel reception. I ordered the prix fix menu at \u20ac11 which included a starter, main, dessert, drink and bread - really good deal!The food itself was a bit hit and miss. My pasta starter with marinara was the perfect texture but a little lacking in overall flavor. My grilled chicken dish was wayyyy too rich and salty. To the the point where I was scraping the sauce off the chicken. The actual meat was really tender though! For dessert, I had a cake with chocolate. Delicious, sweet and rich. I could only handle a couple of bites, but it's perfect for someone with a sweet tooth. Service was actually pretty good especially considering how busy they were during lunch. And most of the people seemed to be enjoying their meals, so I might have just ordered the wrong menu items. But overall I was sadly underwhelmed and likely wouldn't return.",
