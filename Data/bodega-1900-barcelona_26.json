    "During an impromptu bike ride through Barcelona, my friend and I tried to see if we could get into Tickets. \u00a0When the waiter said the chance was slim, he recommended we go right across the street to Bodega 1900 which is managed by Ferran Adri\u00e0's younger brother Albert Adri\u00e0. \u00a0The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the food was phenomenal (see photo). I'd recommend those trying to experience molecular gastronomy outside of San Sebasti\u00e1n and who can't try Tickets to come here!",
