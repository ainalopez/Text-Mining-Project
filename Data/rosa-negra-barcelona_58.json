    "Very good Mexican food 1/2 way around the world. My Chicken Mole was outstanding, as was my wife's Chicken Enchilada. They also had several classic Mexican cervezas, including Negra Modelo (my personal favorite). \u00a0The service was excellent (though we did have an early dinner by Spanish standards). \u00a0The place was packed by 8:30pm. The staff was extremely friendly. \u00a0A VERY nice break from Tapas.",
