    "I came here twice in one week. \u00a0The food the first time around was that good that I wanted to share the experience with my special someone. \u00a0I had the panang curry on my first visit. \u00a0It was beautifully presented in a 1/2 coconut husk/shell. \u00a0It was so full of flavor and it didn't disappoint. \u00a0I have to agree, the place is a little high on the prices and makes the wallet much lighter after 2 visits in one week, but it's been worth it so far. \u00a0I don't intend on eating there till I'm broke, but I'll be back. \u00a0The second time I went I had the Tuna wasabi burger. Wasn't as impressive as the curry, but apparently it wasn't on the weekend brunch menu. insert sad face. \u00a0I saw several salmon and quinoa dishes passing my table during lunch. \u00a0It looked delicious! \u00a0If my panang isn't on the menu on my next visit, I might give that one a try.",
