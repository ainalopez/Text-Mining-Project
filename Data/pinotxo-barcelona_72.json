    "This is small restaurant inside the market off La Rambla where you sit along a countertop. \u00a0The restaurant is very popular and has limited seating so you may find yourself waiting for a seat. \u00a0It is well worth the wait. This was one of the most amazing meals I had in Barcelona and the price was very reasonable. Be sure to get here early since the place is popular and they tend to run out of items on the menu. My recommendation is that you try the garbanzos. Wow!",
