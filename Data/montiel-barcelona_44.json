    "Excellent service. Very good food. Had one complaint that made a several dishes I was really looking forward to disappointing. And I realize this is a matter of taste, but: Some European restaurants seem to embrace making seafood with that fishy/brine-y taste. Like most Americans, I like my fish clean tasting. Not really sure why anybody would want fish tasting otherwise -- you don't want a steak to taste like grassy meadow or chicken to taste like a hen house, why is it OK to have fish tasting/smelling like a harbor at high noon? Also, it has the tendency to make all seafood taste similar rather than allow the taste of the specific fish to come forward. Anyway, my date really enjoyed this place, but that aspect of the seafood dishes hurt it for me.",
