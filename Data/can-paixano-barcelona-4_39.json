    "I wish there was an English menu...then again it probably wouldn't have been as authentic/local. There was a 5-10 min wait to get in around 8pm. It was very crowded and lively. You have to squeeze yourself through to the counter to order. I had a ham/cheese sandwich and croquettes...plus two glasses of cava (which was delicious btw) for 7.50 euros! What a bargain and you get good local atmosphere. Def check it out. It's hidden in an alley but close to a metro stop so not hard to find. Bring your appetite and some Spanish too!",
