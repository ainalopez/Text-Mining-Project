    "Stumbled across this establishment by chance & it turned out to be the highlight of our Barcelona culinary experience.Excellent quality of food for average prices you'll find around the Bari Goric area.Meticulous detail to food presentation, romantic setting and an excellent waiter who recommended us the perfect dishes and just right of food.If you're looking for an authentic and quiet evening for dinner with great food without breaking the bank, Bodega de Palma is for you.Highly, highly recommend the pork shoulder (with rockets, sun dried tomato).",
