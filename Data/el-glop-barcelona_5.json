    "In Spain for the first time and while staying in the Gracias district, we went hunting for some Paella. We ended up here in this bustling restaurant and are happy we came. The Paella was delicious and the service was excellent. We are learning Spanish and are far from fluent. Our waitress was fluent in English and was very helpful with our choices. The paella and service was good however , this feels like a good down home local restaurant. \u00a0Nothing too fancy but also nothing too stellar. \u00a0Would recommend for a decent meal and good service. Spain awaits!",
