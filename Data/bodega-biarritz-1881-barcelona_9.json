    "I think other reviews have provided pretty thorough explanations of this place, so I'll keep mine short. We stumbled across this place while wandering the Barri Gotic and it looked intriguing. The food looked beautiful and appetizing and did not disappoint. They had a wide variety of legit vegetarian options. What stood out to me most was that the staff was extremely nice and attentive. Additionally most, if not all, were bilingual English/Spanish (at least!-they may know more languages). They were especially patient with people when explaining what each tapa was and ingredients it contained. Good find!",
