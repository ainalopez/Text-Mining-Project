    "I was wandering through the El Born district one evening and the cozy warmth of this place drew me in. \u00a0Like others said, comfy couches, books and a few tables (only one outside). \u00a0I had two glasses of the house red wine, a yummy grilled sandwich of goat cheese, onion marmalade and walnuts (I think!). \u00a0I asked for a small side salad. \u00a0All was cheerfully brought to my table without too much of a wait. \u00a0My bill was 6.5 euros...total. \u00a0Others were eating salads, plates of meat and cheeses, and desserts. \u00a0All looked to be a wonderful quality. \u00a0Go, relax, enjoy.",
