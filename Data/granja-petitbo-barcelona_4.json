    "Ah, the fancy breakfast in the morning consisting of brunch items. I had the Goat Cheese sandwich because of the overdosing of Jamon Serrano I have been indulging in every single day in Spain. It was good, but not excellent. The vegetables were fresh and the cheese plenty. The open sandwich eggs benedict were good, love runny eggs and herbs with the smoked salmon underneath, but it was a bit too heavy for an early morning meal. Dishes are medium large, so you can share. The place is small, and it does get packed fast. They also have a variety of cold pressed juices excellent for detoxing before you keep abusing your liver later that day. Nice but slightly slow service.",
