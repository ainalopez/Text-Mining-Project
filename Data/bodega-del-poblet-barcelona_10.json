    "If you're close to Gaudi's cathedral then you are close to this spot. A friend in spain recommended this place and it was by far the best and most unexpected meal in Barcelona. We had just about everything they served and you really cannot go wrong in here. Seafood in general was my favorite with sardines and the baby eels on bread being my #1Barcelona has to be one of the greatest cities in the world. Amazing people and places like this.GO OUT in Barcelona at night, walk to Las Ramblas and sit at any fountain. Buy a beer from the locals and just take it all in. My #1 going out city in the world is Barcelona, so much fun !",
