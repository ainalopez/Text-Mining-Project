    "I'm sorry. I never leave bad reviews. But we were really disappointed. It was our last night in Barcelona. The food was not good. The cheese plate was sad. The Spanish omelette was very dry and old. The food was very fast but only because it was not fresh. Even the caprese salad which is not easy to ruin was bad. It was not balsamic and oil but pesto and loads and loads of oil. The mozarella was very old and bitter. Unfortunately the service was not good either. :( I feel bad I had to write this.",
