    "Really good seafood plates in a nice sit down restaurant. It is located near the Barceloneta area and has access to some really fresh seafood, and it shows in the food they serve. The shrimp, mussels, and cockels, and catch of the day(white fish) were all cooked amazingly well. The eggplant sashimi was a miss - while it's what they said (uncooked eggplant), it didn't taste amazing. However, the plating was well done, and the couscous it came with was very savoury. The Padron peppers, garden tomatoes and zucchini hearts were also great, but definitely not as amazing as the seafood dishes.Although the portions are somewhat small or tapas sized, the prices are reasonable and we ended up ordering about eight different dishes and a bottle of wine for under 100\u20ac. The coolest thing is that they bring you a giant (English menu available as well) menu to your table for you to order from!",
