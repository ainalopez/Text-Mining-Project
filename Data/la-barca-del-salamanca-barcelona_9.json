    "Great little place, but I felt a little taken advantage of. I didn't have a chance to even sit down or look at a menu before they whisked me away to the back to pick out my \"fresh seafood.\" I didn't know what I was looking for so I was recommended a bunch of seafood by the guy who didn't speak English.After shoving a bunch of seafood in my face, then onto a plate, I was sat down for dinner. Then handed a $250 Euro bill... Not pleased about that.The food was decent - not $250 a person good.",
