    "This is a fantastic spot in the El Raval neighborhood for tasty food at incredibly reasonable prices. The menu del dia is about 6 euros including bread, drink and dessert. Their specialty is rotisserie chicken. The whole place, which isn't very big, is saturated with the smell of slowly roasting meat. Yum. They have an extensive menu including beef stew and lasagna. They also rotisserie rabbit.We found it by an Internet search looking for paella. The site I found was rather misleading concerning the price of this dish stating under 5 euros but it was priced at 24 euros for two people. We went for it anyway and were not disappointed. It feeds more like three VERY hungry people and came with bread and an appetizer of patatas bravas (fried potatoes w spicy sauce), roasted peppers and croquettes (tuna coated in breadcrumbs n fried, I think it was tuna... Tasty whatever it was). The paella was full of mussels, clams, whole prawns and bits of roasted chicken on the bone. Sooo good. Disclaimer: this was my first paella experience so I have nothing to compare it to. The place was mostly full of Old Spanish men dining alone. Definitely an old guy local favorite. It's not trendily decorated and there is only bar seating. One major plus for me was cups of red wine filled to the brim for one euro a pop. Yeah! If you are looking for very good comfort food at incredibly good prices with a glimpse into how the locals eat, go here!",
