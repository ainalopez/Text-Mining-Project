    "Frankly, we landed on this place because we needed something decent to eat after spending the whole morning and early noon at the city on our latest day in Barcelona. Just because it fell on Monday late noon around 3 PM, not many choices were left... Most of the restos at the beach were closed and one of my Guys isnt a fan of such Fast Foods afterall, so the choices were even tighter.Quickly we were all agreed for Paellas and the choice was right. Nicely prepared, cooked and presented!The staffs were abit ignored but I could live with it as its over their regular business hour anyway. The venue is modern designed and furnished. A great view to the beach makes the simple meal even tastier!The 3* are given due to the impatient waiters and the table we were seated at as the others (better ones!) were closed.",
