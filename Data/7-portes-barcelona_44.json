    "This restaurant makes quite a first impression on the visual front; I don't know if it is the chess tile or the dark wood, but it is quite inviting and screams of good food. We made a reservation for three people and were, accordingly, seated immediately; no kidding, though, a solid 20 minutes transpired between our being seated and a waitress' popping by to take our drink orders. By then, we'd thoroughly studied all available literature on the offerings and knew very well what we wanted. For our appetizer courses, we had some Iberian ham with bread with tomato, as well as some fried calamari. The calamari platter was respectable and generous in size, but it was the ham that completely enamored me. I kid you not, the combination of Iberian ham, tomato, garlic, oil, and perfectly toasted bread is one of the greatest things you will ever taste in your life. The rich man's paella was delectable, dark and moist, featuring plenty of shellfish, as well as other kinds of meat. I would have liked more of a saffron presence, but it was very good nonetheless.For dessert, I had the milhojas; truth be told, I wasn't charmed. A good milhojas is an intricately layered tower of puff pastry and milky sweet; this was a rather dry, burnt pastry with a cream filling.The service was, overall, incredibly slow, albeit courteous.",
