    "This was an amazing find! \u00a0Recommended by our hotel's concierge, we'd highly recommend this charming restaurant ourselves! \u00a0We actually went for drinks one night and tapas the next. \u00a0Probably one of our favorite meals in Barcelona. \u00a0The jamon wrapped croquets were amazing. \u00a0We also loved the eggplant dish. \u00a0Our favorite however was the potatoes drizzled with a cream and red sauce (much like a spicy romesco). \u00a0We talked about how delicous the potatoes were the rest of our trip. \u00a0I highly recommend reservations. \u00a0Enjoy!",
