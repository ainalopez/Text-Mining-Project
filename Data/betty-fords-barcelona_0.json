    "My first visit to Barcelona, and I got excited to see a bar named after an American addiction center...oh this has got to be good! I'll say that the interior is quite small but there are plenty of seats available either by the bar or at tables (the bar was crowded). It's very dimly lit at the table, however the movie projector provides ample lighting. The movie is played silently, and patrons are treated to American hip hop, soul, and a few light classics blaring in the background. The food- burgers and fries! That's all that is on the menu. About 5 or 6 options served with Fries. Please remember to tell the server (who might be the handsome Aussie owner) how you like your burger, as it will made medium well as a formality. I forgot to order my burger medium well and had send it back. Fries and nice and crispy, but you should also request condiments as they are not on every table Drinks- reasonable priced, good quality.",
