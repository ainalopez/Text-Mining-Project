    "LOVED this place. \u00a0Wish they would come to LA! \u00a0I'm going to start this off by saying that I don't really like falafel, so I didn't eat my falafel at all, and if I had gone back, I probably would have asked for no falafel, so it wouldn't take up space in my pita. \u00a0You have two options, a falafel pita, or a falafel bowl, with or without fries I think. You can pay extra to add feta cheese or some strange looking guacamole (we didn't). Then, there's this salad bar type thing with sort of like a smorgasbord of every appetizer from your typical So. Cal Mediterranean restaurant, and let's see if memory serves me: those little lebanese picklesfried cauliflower (yum)some kind of rice salad (yum) sundried tomatoesregular tomatoesolives (yum)garbanzo salad (extra yum)some kind of olive spread (not like tapenade though)marinated carrotsmushroomshummusyogurt saucetahiniI can't remember anything else, but there was tons of stuff, and the only thing I wasn't interested in was the falafel itself. \u00a0You can put any and all of this into your pita (or bowl) and it was all so good. So you can see why I regretted wasting space with the falafel, when I could have just had some extra fried cauliflower instead. I wish we'd had time to go back. I passed another location in BCN and one in Madrid. I just looked online and they DO exist in the US! \u00a0Come to LA, damn it!",
