    "Right smack dab next to the Picasso Museum, this tapas bar is known for their *tada* CHAMPAGNE. Their tapas offerings are consistently good, much better than they need to be given the real estate they occupy, and you can catch live flamenco next door. It's always crowded, but it's a fun crowd. You'll have a great time.",
