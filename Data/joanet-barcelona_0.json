    "This lovely restaurant was right below our flat and we can attest to it being busy with locals and tourists, and for good reason. They make simple food taste incredible. Our last morning there I had the yogurt with fruit and honey. It sounds plain and boring, but what I got was as assortment of diced fresh fruit on top of a whole bowl of yogurt and drizzled with honey, all for 4.5 euros. Their coffee is perfect, and their alcoholic beverages are fantastic- I had a screwdriver with freshly squeezed orange juice and a generous pour of vodka. We never made it for lunch or dinner, but I wish we had! Also, the plaza seating is shaded and in a great area. Most of the wait staff speaks English and was very kind to tolerate our poor Spanish! Tourist-friendly for sure!",
