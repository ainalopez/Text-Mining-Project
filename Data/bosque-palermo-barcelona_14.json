    "Best seafood paella ever! And as if there wasn't enough seafood already, we also had the mixed seafood plate! I can seriously eat this everyday!After a very unauthentic and boring paella on our first night here in Barcelona, this seafood paella from Bosque Palermo is definitely more in line with what I have expected. The rice was flavorful without being over-seasoned or salty and had the perfect chewy bite. There was plenty of seafood (shrimps, clams, mussels), and everything was very fresh tasting. The mixed seafood plate was equally tasty. The seafood was nicely grilled and lightly seasoned. There were cod, salmon, shrimp, mussels, octopus and clams. Our server spoke decent amount of English, and we ordered with no trouble. Per his recommendation, we also got a tiramisu gelato-y dessert to finish off the meal.",
