    "A nice modern space serving up pintxo which are little snacks with a small skewer through it. Servers will seat you and bring you your drinks but it's all self-serve after that. You go up to the bar and just select away. There's no names or descriptions so go with your best guess. Not the place of you are too picky. They have mostly items on a slice of bread with cheese and sardines or ham. Then there's hot items like chicken wings, stuffed fried ball, mini burger, tempura etc. and there's also desserts. Only tried savoury stuff and they were all decent and average. Nothing amazing but fine for a somewhat inexpensive meal. You place your sticks into a container they give you and the server counts the sticks at the end. Each stick is 1.75\u20ac. Cava is 3\u20ac per glass. For two people we had 12 sticks and 2 cavas totalling 27\u20ac. Service was fast and efficient. Place was full at dinner but turned over fairly well. There's outdoor seating and it's near the Barcelona Cathedral.",
