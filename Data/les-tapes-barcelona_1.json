    "For Americans:The spanish reviews are a little misguided for our tastes.The cave they speak of is tiny and very cramped. \u00a0The ambience they speak of is negligible for the experience. \u00a0Interior photos would have helped, but I couldnt get my phone out of my pocket from the table I was at to get one.Service is good. \u00a0Our server spoke both Engilsh and Spanish, and was even conversing pretty well with the Italians in our section.The tapas were OK at best.Price was fine, even cheap I suppose.Not knocking the place, but we expected more. \u00a0No \"taste of Barcelona\" here.Best thing I had was the tuna empanada, which my wife hated, so take that with a grain of salt.",
