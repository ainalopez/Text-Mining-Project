    "Snails were pre-mo.Seafood was stellar.Paella was the best in all of Spain, competing against Granada, another place in Barcelona, and San Sebastian.Service was great, no complaints.Six thumbs up. (two for each of our party)We were recommended this restaurant from a local for typical food of Barcelona and Spain. \u00a0We had tapas while were were in Barcelona, so our focus was on paella and seafood. \u00a0We had a combo plate as a starter, a bottle of wine, a pot of mussels with garlic and tomatoes, \u00a0a single serving of the all fish paella and a desert of snails. \u00a0It seamed like a upscale local place with its fair share of the tourist crowd, but when we called to get a reservation (as recommend by our local) they did not have any availability and suggested just coming by to see if there was space. There was and we had a great night and good food.e",
