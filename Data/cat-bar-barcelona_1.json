    "I went to the cat bar for lunch (I could not enter the crowded place the night before) and I had a nice experience !the vegan burgers are good but not amazing : I had the beans burger and my friend has the mexican burger which was quite spicy. The steaks were tasty but the bread was really disappointing : dry and a bit crumbly. After two bites you can not grab it properly in your hands. The topping is okay and I did not try the fries. In a word : the only tasty thing is the yummy steak. The choice is not huge either : 5 kinds of burger and thats it.I really liked the place though : everything is made from second-hand items. The tables come from ancient sewing machine, the lampshades are made from forks or strainers. The all atmosphere is very welcoming and I love the fact they offer glass bottle instead of plastic bottle like everywhere else in Barcelona !!I better go back for the beer bar at night !",
