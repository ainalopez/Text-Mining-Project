    "There are only 20 ish seats surrounding the kitchen and bar area, but turnover is pretty quick. It's probably best to come with 2 people since seats mostly open up in twos.It was only \u20ac3.25 for a glass of Brut rose, and my second glass ended up being on the house. \u00a0They give you a paper menu, and you mark what you want with a pencil and hand it over to them.Since this was our first lunch (to be followed by a 15+ course lunch tasting menu...), we decided to order \"lightly\". \u00a0However, everything ended up being pretty heavy. - Eggs and baby squid (\u20ac19): their signature egg dish. The baby squid was well seasoned, super tender, not rubbery, but I don't love baby squid, and along with the two fried eggs, they were drowning in a deep layer of oil - Prawns (\u20ac21): cooked in a garlic, chili, butter and cava reduction. \u00a0The prawns were super plump and tender, sweet on their own, and enhanced with the super garlicky buttery sauce. \u00a0The sauce had a good bite from the chili. \u00a0The rusty bread they give you (complimentary) is perfect for soaking all of this up.- Setas (\u20ac12): saut\u00e9ed assorted mushrooms plages with a sweet sauce on the side. These were good with the sauce but were still pretty oily.Again, I liked the crusty bread a lot to soak up the extra sauces, but you'll also be soaking up a lot of oil / fat.It's pricier than what I expected for a boqueria stand, but it was cool to see chef Quim there running the kitchen.Bonuses:- They have Purell packets at the tables so you can clean your hands- There are purse / backpack hooks under the counter so that you're less likely to get pick pocketed (we were warned about the boqueria...)- Credit cards accepted",
