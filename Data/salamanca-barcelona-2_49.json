    "6 of us initially went to Los Caracoles for dinner. They appeared rude & we decided to go elsewhere. Salamanca was recommended by the Irish Pub in town. We took the beautiful walk along the marina, and were greeted by a wonderful hostess who welcomed us even though we didn't have reservations. Our waiter \"Jose Ruiz\" was awesome & turned the evening around for us. The Fideua was spectacular. We felt welcome there & enjoyed our evening immensely. This was by far the best meal in Barcelona the 6 of us had & we left with pleasant rememberances. When visiting Barcelona from the USA, forget Los Caracoles, & stroll down the waterway to Salamanca. It's worth the short walk",
