    "This was my \"Welcome to Barcelona\" meal and I was not disappointed. First of all, please arrive early. By early, I mean 9pm which is still early bird special in Spain.Second of all, do me a favor and skip the tomato bread if you're not a huge fan of tomatoes.Now, do yourself a favor and order the fried artichokes (even if you're not an artichoke fan because you will be. They taste like potato chips!) and order my beloved patatas bravas! This very Spanish dish which can be found everywhere was the best at Paco Meralgo. The cheesy sauce is rich but then on top of that, they add chili oil which provides the perfect amount of heat.The seafood is seriously fresh so you can't go wrong with anything there. Also, go ahead and order a pitcher of sangria because it goes with everything.",
