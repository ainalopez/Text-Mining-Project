    "This place is a bit of a tourist trap, but not that bad; definately don't go out of your way to visit or you might just be disappointed.Large variety of pintxos which are around EUR 2-3 each and there is a picture menu (surprisingly helpful) or you can sit near the bar. Watch out for the random person visiting your table asking \"do you want to try xxx\" and then placing it down. Of course you are not trying, you are buying :)The outdoor seating on the street is a great people watching opportunity.",
