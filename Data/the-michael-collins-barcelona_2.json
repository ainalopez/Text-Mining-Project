    "An old-school Irish Pub right across from \u00a0La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. We had about an hour before out ticket time, so we went in for a pint. Christa had an iced tea, and I had a Guinness. Atmosphere is just as you would imagine in a place that has existed, and has been collecting trinkets for display, from early last century. Lots of history and lost of personality. It would be a most interesting experience to spend a night here among the local rowdy crowd.",
