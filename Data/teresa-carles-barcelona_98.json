    "Love Barcelona for a short week to combine shopping and nice dining, and as I was looking for a good alternative for the boring and mediocre breakfast buffet one usually gets at the hotel, I decided to follow the advice from a local friend to go to Teresa Carles..... and what a delicious surprise! Excellent food & juices, fresh and tasty and even less expensive than breakfast at the hotel! It made me curious to explore more of the menu of TC. My daughter, who is more into this type of vegetarian dishes, was already very enthusiast about the variety offered and the flavour combinations, so her expectations were high. And it really exceeded both her and my expectations! Next to breakfast, we went for dinner and also had lunch there a couple of times. Great food at reasonable prices! Teresa Carles is definitely added to our shortlist of favourite places in Barca to enjoy food!",
