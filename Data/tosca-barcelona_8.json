    "Awesome little gem across from La Palau de la Musica. Such a great value! We tried the 11 euro special of 3 tapas, a drink (either wine, beer or sangria) and a coffee. There was so much food, we ate maybe half and were stuffed! I tried the mushroom and carrot risotto, the fried potatoes and this goat cheese & mozzarella empanada. Carb-a-licious. Their sangria was off the hook! The service was also great, as the server was extra nice and helpful. Next time I'm in Barcelona, I need to come back and try a few more things!",
