    "Good American place if that's what you are looking for in Spain. Lot's of Americans.The queue wasn't too bad, considering the time and location. We waited for about 30 minutes for a table of three. \u00a0Eggs Florentine, Eggs Salmon, and a hamburger with potatoes - tasty, quick service, decent price.Waitresses were super friendly and helpful.",
