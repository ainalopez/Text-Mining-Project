    "GREAT BAR. it's not just your normal tapas place, or your overpriced spot in borne, it's got it's own personality. Great place to take someone visiting, on a date, or just stop for a beer. They've got two sections, upstairs and downstairs so make sure to identify which entrance you're going to meet at! We made that mistake... Enjoy!",
