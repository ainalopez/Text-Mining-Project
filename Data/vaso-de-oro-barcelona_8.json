    "Wow. Just wow. What a perfect way to end my Spain trip. Came here upon a recommendation and my group had such a great time squeezing into this narrow bar and eating delicious tapas alongside a lively Barcelona crowd.Everything was fantastic: Anchovies, olives stuffed with anchovies, padron peppers, manchego cheese, croquettes. EVERYTHING. You absolutely must get the steak - it's tender, juicy, and everything you've ever wanted. Add foie gras to completely change your life.The beer was cold and the waiter was HOT HOT HOT.",
