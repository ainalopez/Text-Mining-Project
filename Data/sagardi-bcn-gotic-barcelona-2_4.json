    "Had an early dinner here. Service was pretty good. \u00a0They have a nice patio area if you want to sit outside. I had 4 different tapas and they were all pretty good.I think stuffed red pepper with Tuna was my favorite. \u00a0I didn't love the croquette. I've had better. \u00a0Prices were very reasonable. \u00a0I had a glass of cava and 4 tapas for 11\u20acI would definitely recommend checking it out and then stroll around the el born neighborhood because it's very cool.",
