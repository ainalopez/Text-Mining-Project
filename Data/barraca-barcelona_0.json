    "Went to Barraca back in February, after hearing that it has one of the best paellas in Barcelona. I walked over to the restaurant (excellent location right beside the beach), and found out that it didn't open for lunch until 13h00 (I had arrived around noon)! That said, I wandered the beach until opening time.Ordered a seafood paella, along with vermouth. Vermouth was sweet and strong, which I enjoyed. Paella came in a skillet- a bit burnt, but not completely charcoal black. Still, presentation wasn't ideal. The dish was quite salty, but it went well with all of the rice and generous amounts of seafood- much appreciated!Not the cheapest establishment, and the paella was a bit too salty for my taste, but service was good and the location by the sea can't be beat! Give Barraca a try (or rather, a taste)!",
