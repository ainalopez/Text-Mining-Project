    "What a gem! This place is definitely worth the visit, even if it's not nearby you. \u00a0The atmosphere and dim and cozy, the sangria is excellent, and the food is great! \u00a0Great mix of tapas and regular portions. \u00a0We started off with a few tapas, and ended up ordering a few more rounds instead of ordering entrees. \u00a0Totally worth the re/visit.",
