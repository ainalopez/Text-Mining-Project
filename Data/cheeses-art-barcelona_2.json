    "Wow. Well we were tourists visiting on our honeymoon and decided to each have a burger. \u00a0Biggest mistake of our trip. \u00a0It was hard to taste the meat because it was covered with yummy cheese and fixings....I just trusted that the meat was ok. Presentation was beautiful, salad was delicious but a few hours later we realized our mistake. \u00a05 days later and we're still feeling the effects...horrible food poisoning. \u00a0I wouldn't risk eating their burgers unless you're from there and are used to that meat. Buyer beware.",
