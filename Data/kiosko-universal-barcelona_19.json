    "No visit to the Marcat de la Boquaria is complete without having a meal at one of its many mouthwatering food stalls with wide selections of offerings from tapas, to empedanas to seafood grilled to order.On our visit to Barcelona'a famous mercat, we found Kiosko Universal, the stall with the most busy counter in the whole place. There were so many stalls to choose from, we went with our eating theory: if the place is packed with locals and tourists alike and there is a line, this is the place to eat. Lucky for us, 2 counter spaces opened up as we walked up to the kiosk. Sat down and immediately our mouths were drooling over the seafood displayed in the refrigerated glass case in front of us. An amazing array of selection from all types of fish to jumbo shrimps, all sorts of shell fish and also cold and warm side dishes such as 5 mushrooms saut\u00e9ed etc.We ordered a plate of grilled sardines and it came with 5 servings of good size sardines. These weren't the tiny sardines we were used to getting. Took us no time to destroyed that. Then came an order of grilled razor clams drizzled with parsley and herbs in olive oil. The razor clams were grilled to perfection and very meaty and fresh. Finally the finale, grilled jumbo shrimps so huge and the meat were so thick and juicy. Everything were extremely fresh, the prices were reasonable and the service was friendly and comfortable. Considering this was the third and last food stall on our visit, we managed to saved room for the best seafood lunch at our Barcelona trip. So good that we've been telling all our friends who plan to go to this Catalan city to put Kiosko Universal on their list of places to eat above Gaudi's Sagrada Familia.",
