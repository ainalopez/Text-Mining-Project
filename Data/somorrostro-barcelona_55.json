    "We searched for paella and found this place. It turned out to be so much more. In this tiny place (8-10 tables) their chef creates magic. He uses a lot of foams and gels but was not overdone at all. They have a choice of 2 or 3 plates for dinner. We had pumpkin gaspacho, foie gras, pork cheek and red mullet and mussels. A perfectly balanced meal that wasn't too heavy. The wait staff were very helpful and had great English. With a bottle of wine 70\u20ac. Best meal we had in Barcelona so far.",
