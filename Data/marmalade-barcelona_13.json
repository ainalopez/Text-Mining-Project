    "While we were in Barcelona, we discovered Milk which is the sister restaurant for Marmalade. We decided to try this place out for dinner and we made a reservation as well. We got here and we ordered the cheese plate, which was very amazing! I remember ordered a few cocktails which were decently priced and they were all good! The burgers were good, the ribs were good and the services was very attentive. I would definitely recommend coming here. It reminds of places you find in DTLA.",
