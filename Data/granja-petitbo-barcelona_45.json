    "This place is so overrated and overpriced! The place is always overcrowded and I've had better tasting food elsewhere that cost less with better customer service. I ordered the quinoa salad but with too much cheese and mandarin orange, not enough quinoa and greens...not as good as it looks. My boyfriend ordered the eggs Benedict which was a small portion and lacking substance...also overpriced. The juices were good but they only give you a small portion with a huge ice cube which tricks you into thinking you are getting more juice. On top of all this, the lady (middle age with long blonde ponytail) kicked us out claiming that our table is reserved for another guest even though the ladies sitting at the table next to us were there before us and had already finished eating when we had just begun eating. If you want a place where you can not relax with overpriced food, this is where you go. Definitely not recommended.",
