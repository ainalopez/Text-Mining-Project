    "What a bummer! I was really looking forward to this place because all of the awesome reviews. As soon as we were walking towards brunch and cake we saw a crowd outside waiting to be seated. They don't take reservations so obviously I thought people were waiting because it was that good. For two people the wait was 30 minutes. There was a constant stream of people waiting. Even when we were seated, eating, and after we left. We ordered two smoothies to breakfast plates and one sweets plate. 1- berry smoothie (tart, fresh, delicious) 2- multi vitamin smoothie (less tart than berry, creamier, and also delicious) 3- egg Benedict with turkey on top of a organic hot dog (AMAZING. Holy moly didn't know eggs Benedict could taste this good) 4- potato scrambled eggs with Iberian ham on toast ( they had potato chips mixed into scrambled eggs!! Was amazing but very salty. And the Iberian ham (cured meat) obviously uber salty-- I couldn't finish it because of the salt levels) 5- pancake with Nutella and banana (typical silver dollars, nothing crazy) Total was 30 something euros not bad at all. Food came out pretty fast! Esp shocking because they claim everything is made to order. Would I come again? No. Just because it's just too salty for me. Nothing was crazy good. Only the eggs Benedict. Plus there are so manyyyyyyy brunch spots and tapas places in Barcelona I would want to try them all before going somewhere twice !!",
