    "If you are struggling to choose your dishes because all of them look appetizing, let the chef do the job and amaze you with its tasting menu! With the 5 courses tasting menu ($38) and the friendly staff, who is knowledgeable on every dish, ingredients and wine, I had one of the best dining experiences in Barcelona!My 5 courses including: Sardine covered in spiced butter - a delicate presentation with the butter takes away the fishy taste of sardine.Mackerel with bok choy and yogurt - the highlight of the meal! The fish is well-prepared and I love the sprinkle of broccoli as decoration. \u00a0 \u00a0 Egg Souffle - It caught my attention right when it was served - it looks like a giant toasted marshmallow! Order it for its presentation or for the creaminess when the yolk is mixed with the vegetable at the bottom.St. Pierre - this fish has a firm texture and a beautiful color after grilling it. The pine nut sauce adds the flavor to the dish.Pigeon - I was surprised by how tender the pigeon tasted since it's my first time trying it! It has this texture that you can't find in any other kind of meat. Pear & Coffee (dessert) - the sweetness of the pear, the bitterness of the coffee, and the sourness of the cream give an interesting balance of flavors. Also, the chocolate ball with liquor inside adds some fun to the dessert!",
