    "Tonight was my second time here. It is a wonderful little place located near Las Rambla. The service and the food was excellent. Tonight I had a salad with anchovies and than sausage with white beans. Although that was enough I saw too many yummy deserts heading out to other tables so I had to try the chocolate mouse. It was a great meal.",
