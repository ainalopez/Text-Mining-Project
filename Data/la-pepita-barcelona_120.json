    "Hands down. Top to bottom the best tapas spot we went to in BCN. Sat at the bar where the beer and wine flowed at all times. Barkeep was very attentive even though it was crazy busy! Every dish we got was delicious. The melon gazpacho was my favorite!!! So refreshing, perfect for a warm evening. Also got the Argentine beef skewer (cooked perfectly), foie gras with potatoes and fried egg (so decadent and delicious), and the lightest fried calamari I've ever had. Honored to have this place as our last meal in Barcelona. If you're ever around this spot, please take the time to go and have a drink and a meal. Can get very busy, but busy spots mean the place is good. La Pepita however, is better than good. It's great!",
