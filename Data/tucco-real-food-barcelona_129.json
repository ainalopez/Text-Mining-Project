    "Stopped here for dinner on our way back from the beach and we were so happy we did! The pasta was the best pasta we had in Spain (we went to places in Madrid, Barcelona, and Andalucia). All pasta is made fresh and you can definitely tell. \u00a0On top of the food, the staff there was all incredibly friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend!",
