    "During a one week trip to Barcelona with my husband we actually ate here twice. The food was really good (my favorites were the strip of sirloin, patatas bravas, olives, and Spanish bread). There are a lot of options aside from the typical ham and seafood that most Spanish/tapas places offer which I loved. Also, the drinks were great and reasonably priced (I highly recommend their mojitos - 5\u20ac). The staff was friendly as well. I would definitely go back. It does get pretty packed though so if you are with a large party you may end up waiting a while for a table.",
