    "Located in between Sagrada Familia and Park Guell, this restaurant offers the BEST vegetarian/vegan/overall healthiest lunch in Barcelona. \u00a0Fresh ingredients and fantastic ambience. The proprietor makes every dish himself on the spot. \u00a0He could easily be on Top Chef. \u00a0We ordered zucchini spaghetti, fresh pressed juice, and a veggie sandwich. \u00a0If you appreciate real food, do yourself a favor and take a stroll to Quinoa Bar.",
