    "Yay yelp! \u00a0We found El Laurel because of you and loved it! \u00a0I don't \u00a0think you can go wrong with any of empanadas or salads. \u00a0As a family of four we ordered whole bunch of things and shared them. \u00a0All were delicious. \u00a0The patrons and staff are mostly local and seem to hang out regularly. \u00a0Not a lot of english but there is an english menu and they met us half way. \u00a0Wish I could go there now!",
