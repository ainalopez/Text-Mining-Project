    "A favorite amongst people in my study abroad program. Based on the ~10 person (15 minute) line each time we visit, you know it's good. Your meat ingredients are cooked fresh for your sandwich and the sky's the limit for toppings. This is a great, filling meal for less money than others in the area and I would highly recommend it. Just try to get there outside of peak lunchtime hours in Barcelona! Also keep in mind that Bo de B only accepts cash.",
