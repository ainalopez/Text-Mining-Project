    "We went here in the late afternoon on the recommendation of our B&B host. OMG it was wonderful! We did the Set Menu for 25 Euro each. The appetizers alone would have been a great meal but then we had the Paella, Catalonian Creme and Sangria. Thank goodness for Siestas!! The seafood was all very fresh tasting. Several items were deep fried which I am very picky about but I have to say this was great, must have used very fresh oil and not burned! Waiter was very pleasant and helpful. Appears to be family owned and while we were there all the other guests seemed to be local regulars.",
