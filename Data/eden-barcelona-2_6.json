    "I went to Barcelona this summer, and this and a churro place are the only places I can really review because they were so memorable.If you are close, and you are sick of eating tapas every meal, go here. This is honestly my favorite meal from Barcelona - a cozy fantastic italian restaurant nestled a few blocks off avenue diagonal.I got the cannoli, and it was beautiful. So cheesy, so well cooked, so incredibly delicious. If I go back to Barcelona, I will check to see if I can stop in and get a dish, because it is so so good. There's a reason this place has 4.5 stars. It's good, people. There is no reason you should not try this place.",
