    "It's hard to find good Mexican food 'round these parts. Rosa Negra is passable and works for killing cravings. I had a burrito with carne asada and the meat was well seasoned, but compared to what you can get at your average taco shop in the US it was... well... average.Also, they put salsa on the table, but no chips. What is that? It worked, of course-- we all ordered 'nachos' with guacamole (which means 'chips with guacamole' in Spain Mexican speak).Fun atmosphere and great drinks. The michelada I had there was top-notch and worth a return visit. Mmmmm.. micheladas. Oh, and we waited an hour on Saturday at 3:00 for our table. Ouch.",
