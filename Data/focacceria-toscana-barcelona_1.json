    "Pizza was great! (I got the one with blue cheese I forgot the name but I def recommend it) Patatas bravas were also delicious. Churros con chocolate were the best I've had in Barcelona they make them when you order! Service was also great and quick. We came at a crowded time but the employee was sure to try to be efficient and serve everyone quickly. \u00a0will definitely come here again before I leave.",
