    "I had heard that this place is a cool and cheap place to check out in barca. I went with about 7 other friends for some tapas and the cavas. They're famous for their rose cava. We tried the chorizo, croquets, and some of the sandwiches off the menu. Overall, good experience. I would not recommend going with a large group. It's a little difficult considering they don't have tables and it is usually pretty packed.",
