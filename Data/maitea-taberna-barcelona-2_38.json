    "I had a great time here. It was also a great value. We did a \"only on vacation, dinner after dinner\" here. I think I probably tried about six different items and two or three glasses of wine. The best was the fried blood sausage, which spawned me to go on a blood sausage rampage throughout the city. I seriously couldn't get enough. All in all this place is a good bet. Resist your Barcelona-ian instincts and go early, it gets super busy at night.",
