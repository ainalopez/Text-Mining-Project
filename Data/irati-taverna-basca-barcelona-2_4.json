    "The Quick: Love the pinxto (toothpick tapas) idea, but I did not love this restaurant. The Details: The staff is helpful, and the wine is great, but I was not impressed by the options. I think this is a classic tale of a great restaurant that gets too popular. It was extremely touristy and crowded, and the food was just OK. We found a better \"pinxto\" spot nearby we preferred. Pro Tip: They take credit cards and tax and tip is included in the bill (most of Barcelona). The Damage: 1.95* per taste which is average for the area. The red wine was about 2.50* and extremely satisfying. *Prices in Euro",
