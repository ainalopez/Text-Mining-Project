    "Family atmosphere and delicious meal! For lunch, my starter was Galician claims grilled style - dish of about 8 or so claims, nicely done with olive oil and chives sauce. For main I ordered fois-gras raviolis with truffle oil which came with also about 8 raviolis and was delicious and quite filling. My companion had a prix fix menu option, for \u20ac19.50, of goat cheese croton with salad (nicely seasoned with olive oil, balsamic and Dijon mustard seeds), and salt cod vizcaina style (a bit salty for my taste but salt cod is their popular dish). Catalan cuisine, relaxed vibe, good experience!",
