    "good lunch spot near picasso museum.It gets really packed, so hard to navigate if you are not comfortable pushing through a crowd.It's a bit pricey compared to similar tapas places. I think it's because it's near the museum, but if you don't want to venture far from there its a good choice.1. grilled beef and fried peppers - it was overcooked2. sardines in oil - way too salty for meOrdered some other seafood items that weren't memorable",
