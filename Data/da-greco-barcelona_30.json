    "After a week in Barcelona, Melvin Udall would be perfectly at home here. If you are craving a fantastic dinner while in Barcelona, take a taxi to BCN and grab a ticket on the next flight to, oh, anywhere. But Da Greco is where you want to go if a flight is a liitle too ambitious for a dinner out. The minestrone soup is clear, light and tasty. The vegies must be organic, they even leave some sand on them for a true locavore feel. Lasagne is like all Barcelona pastas: \"al dente\" means only 3 more minutes to boil. The filet really was one of the best selections of meat in the town, and prepared well (as in good job, not overcooked). \u00a0The wine list was a delight: straightforward, unsnobby, reasonably priced. One hint: fuggedabout riojas and enjoy the localish Catalonian wines. The decor: uh, well, its unique and entertaining. Don't expect restrooms to be clean and inviting. They are functional. If you find yourself hungry in Barcelona, come here and expect to enjoy yourself but not to be over the top wowed. But, then again, that is as good as it gets.",
