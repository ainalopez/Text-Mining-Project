    "Found this place thanks to all the good reviews on Yelp. This place is located a few streets from La Sagrada Familia. It provides burgers, drinks, English-speaking staff, and wifi! Woohoo! Great for tourists!I ordered the falafel burger even though this place is known for its high-quality meat, because I was trying to be healthy. My BF and his mom ordered two different beef burgers. Every burger is served with fries. I asked to switch the fries out for tostones but you can't switch the fries. Our waitress was so nice and offered to let us try a 1/2 order of tostones.Tostones: 3 mini plaintain discs, topped with a creamy coleslaw and some sauce. Very good, wish I had ordered the whole portion as my meal!Falafel burger: good, home-made. A little dry. The cheese (queso cabra) was a little strong and dry itself. I wish it came with the red pepper-looking relish on my BF's burger to add some more wetness to the burger.Tasted a bit of the meat of the beef burger and was hit by the delicious, juicy, high-quality taste of the burger. It was so good. My bad choice with the falafel burger, I should have ordered what they're known for (any beef burgere).The thick-cut fries that came with the burger were the right amount and you could tell they made them fresh. I asked for the anauco sauce on the side to try their house sauce. It's like a creamy white cilantro sauce. Tasty but I was expecting more flavor.They have indoor and three outdoor tables. Inside is clean, modern, and cool. Bathrooms are complimentary for customers and clean.To echo other reviewers: great burgers here, good service. Try them out if you're near Sagrada Familia and want something other than tapas! They also offer a ~10 euro special from around 4-8pm that includes a burger, fries, and a drink.",
