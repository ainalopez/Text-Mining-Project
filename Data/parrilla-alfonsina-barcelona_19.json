    "A super cozy Argentinean restaurant with delicious meat. The owner was chatting around the restaurant with all the guests, in Spanish, English, Italian, Portuguese. It's a bit pricy, but worth it. The best meat I have eaten in Barcelona. Definitely going back! Tiramisu and dulce de leche ice cream were also really tasty. Make sure to order some of the amazing empanadas for starter!",
