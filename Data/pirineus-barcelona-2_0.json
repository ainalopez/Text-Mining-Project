    "First Paella and found this small restaurant by chance walking by while they were opening. Family owned and owner opened early to make us Paella. It was very good! \u00a0Small place with limited seating, but since they opened just for us, we had the whole place to ourselves for half an hour which half filled before we left. Tapas menu looked good, but we were on a mission to find a non-touristic place near our hotel to eat Paella and were not disappointed.",
