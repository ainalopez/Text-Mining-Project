    "Every night there is a huge wait here and for very good reason. Everything is exceptional. This was my first cuisine experience in Barcelona and I could not have been more pleased. With a party of 5 we choose to eat everything family style, and let our waiter pick all of our dishes. All the tapas were delicious and a bit more adventurous than we would have chosen ourselves. The wine pairings were phenomenal as well. When I return to Barcelona I will be sure to stop here again!",
