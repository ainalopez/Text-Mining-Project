    "Free wifi is a rarity in this city! They also have delicious red wine for very cheap- I contemplated ordering a whole bottle to myself. We had the baked brie with jam and chili peppers, chorizo sausage with tomato bread, and we split a ham and manchengo sandwich. All were very simple and flavorful and a delicious lunch for two. The service was very friendly as well, when we asked for more toast they were very polite and the waiter took the time to help us go through the menu in English.",
