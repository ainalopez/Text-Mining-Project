    "CDLC really is as good as it gets. Absolutely stunning nightclub with Morrocan and Thai influences and a menu to match, an amazing DJ spining right next to the cabana/beds where we lay and sipped caipirinhas and cava and snacked on tapas while watching and chatting with the most beautiful people from around the world who have descended upon Barca to party. Men and women are dressed to kill and the food and drink was only outdone by the decor. If you're in Barca for just one night this is where you spend it.",
