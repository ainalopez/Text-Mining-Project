    "The outside can be deceiving but the food was fantastic!We started with red sangria and the Jamon, Patatas, bravas and tomato bread. Awesome combination!For main course we ordered the Seabass with spinach and orange and the Argentine beef skewer chimichurri. Both were absolutely fantastic! We drunk and feasted on the Jamon and Patatas all evening.The staff and the patrons were very friendly. You \u00a0can feel you're in the tourist district when you see the check. A solid 4.5 star.",
