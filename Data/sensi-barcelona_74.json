    "I was attracted to this place by the positive reviews for their seafood paella. If you are searching for authentic paella, AVOID THIS PLACE. They do not serve seafood paella. It's actually a seafood risotto, and a very poor one at that. The panko crusted squid, and the peppers were excellent so I had high hopes for the \"paella\" but I was sadly disappointed. The flavor was so vile, I barely ate more than a few bites. When asked how I enjoyed the meal, I said I enjoyed everything except the paella. The server promised to check with the chef but nothing ever came of it, and there it was on the bill at the end as well as unexpected charges for bread and water. Overall a truly frustrating and disappointing experience.",
