    "MY GOODNESS!!! My personal favorite place I went to in Spain. This speakeasy is hidden in an alley near hostels and little bars and it did not disappoint. The staff was very accommodating and was very knowledgeable in all the spirits made there. Usually speakeasys here in the U.S are more for whiskeys, but this place centered gin. My wife and I got a crash course on gin and tonics, and even mixing the right fruits to make it all go. I highly suggest their Bobby Gin special gin and tonic that came with strawberries and grapefruit. Obviously I couldn't leave without having an old fashioned too and they did a fantastic job with it. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Caught them on a slower night so it was a more intimate setting where we talked to one another and the bar staff. Very underrated in the place is the food. Specifically their croquettes. They had 3 different ones but their squid croquettes are to die for. Next time we come there we're definitely getting those, but all squid!!!",
