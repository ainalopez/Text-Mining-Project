    "Prior to coming to Barcelona on vacation, I bookmarked a bunch of restaurants to try based on Yelp reviews. While on the Las Ramblas strip, my family wanted to have dinner and this was the closest one I had marked.The restaurant is hidden in the side streets off Las Rambla and when you come in, you order at the counter, pay, and take your seat. The menu is in Spanish but the nice woman at the counter was very patient in translating everything including the ingredients for us. Our pasta and lasagna dishes all came with a drink (beer, wine, juice, soda, or water). We all enjoyed our pastas and raviolis. My Mom didn't care for her lasagna but we all tried it and thought it was good. We didn't realize our meal included dessert but it was also delicious. Luca, our waiter recommended which dessert to try and was extremely friendly. He asked where we were from and how we were enjoying the city. He gave us a business card and told us to call if we had any questions.Also, loved the music. All chill indie songs in English. Btw, I'm writing this review using their FREE wifi. Definitely reccomend.",
