    "i came here about 6 months ago, so my memory of this place is bit scattered. \u00a0The bits i remember are that this place is awesome. \u00a0we managed to make reservation for 5 of us girls, but we got lost trying to find our way into the little alleys. \u00a0We were about 30-45mins late and they had given away our table. \u00a0However, they were still extremely accommodating and made space for us at the upstairs seating.The staff was great and gave us great recommendations of the food. \u00a0Even though we're obviously tourist, they were not snotty at all. \u00a0Very friend and helpful staff. \u00a0I only remember great things about the food. \u00a0the olive oil for the bread was divine, the oysters were really fresh and the sauce they put on it complimented the flavor perfectly, the suckling pig was cooked perfecti will definitely be back next time i'm in barcelona. \u00a0this is definitely tied with the la boqueria mercat meal i had.",
