    "We were extremely disappointed when eating here. \u00a0The service was ok, the food pretty bad. \u00a0The pasta my husband ordered came out with a thin, watery tomato something on the plate with the past just thrown on top. \u00a0The paella was below average. \u00a0The wine was cheap which was about the only good thing here.",
