    "When in Spain, you must try paella and sangria! \u00a0El Rival, Gothic Quarter, L'Eixample, Mont Juic are all nice parts of Barcelona to sightsee and visit, but we were recommended by a few locals to go to the Barceloneta region for paella (which is closer to the coast). \u00a0Hopping a few trains and walking a few blocks, we encountered Salamanca.The restaurant is a cozy family place. \u00a0Its walls are filled with famous client's portraits who have visited along with frequent customers. Its a little cluttered inside, but the service and the food are worth it.We started with sangria and complimentary french bread with a tomato cheese spread. \u00a0The waiter gave us free saut\u00e9ed padron peppers as an appetizer for waiting on him. \u00a0(Although we didn't remember really waiting that long for him ;) ) \u00a0Drenched with olive oil and sea salt, they were hot (temp wise...not super spicy), and delicious! \u00a0I haven't liked paella in the past; but being in Spain, I had to try it. The paella came out piping hot and was very flavorful! I'm not sure whether we were allowed to share, so the four of us (2 girls & 2 guys) each ordered paella: 3 seafood and 1 vegetarian. \u00a0Only one of us finished our paellas because the portions were pretty big!The dessert menu came and we were all too full so we declined. \u00a0Good thing we did, because they brought out mini almond cakes. (They do this for everyone as their complimentary dessert). \u00a0Our waiter gave us shots of grappa and we called it a night. \u00a0Perhaps it was the slower season (winter), or perhaps our waiter was just nice, but we got great service, excellent food, and a fun night!",
