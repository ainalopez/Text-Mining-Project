    "Very very nice food at Arume. Was there with three others, and between the four of us, we ordered quite a variety of things. The biggest favourite was most likely the duck paella-style rice. Obviously, most of the reviews here refer to paella-- I'll have to agree and say that the duck paella-style dish (as it wasn't exactly a 'paella', but close enough) was out of this world. The suckling pig was also excellent, and my companions had an array of seafood items- including the king prawns and octopus. I think the only thing that was disliked out of our meal was the octopus. It was simply unremarkable. Everything else was so mindblowing that the octupus was wildly out of place. The service and chefs also seemed out of sync- we asked for everything to be brought out all at once (as two people only ordered various appetizers and the others ordered mains), but that didn't work out. Not a big deal, but could be improved upon.Affordable wine, excellent cocktails (though they seemed to be reducing their cocktail list, which was disappointing). Would return, and am very keen to try more of their dishes.",
