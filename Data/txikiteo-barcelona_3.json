    "Basque cuisine. \u00a0An excellent overall meal, I wish that I had ordered more food. \u00a0We ordered patatas bravas, tomato and bread, sausage with apple cider, and something else that I cannot remember. \u00a0All of it was delicious, and the forgotten dish does NOT speak to the quality, there were just too many restaurants tried to remember some of what goes where. \u00a0The potato and tomato dishes were some of the best of these dishes that we had. \u00a0The sausage was a welcome variation on a lot of similar food that we had on our trip. We were in need of coffee, our server offered to \"make something special\" \u00a0he made cafe mocha for us. \u00a0This was not the cafe mocha that I am used to. \u00a0A deep, dark chocolate flavor, and nicely roasted coffee with cream. \u00a0A nice dessert for our meal. \u00a0Our server was friendly, passionate about the food, and attentive.",
