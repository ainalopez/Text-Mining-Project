    "Simply the best meal I've ever had. \u00a0It's comparable to Le Bernadine in NY or The French Laundry in CA, except that the core cuisine is more to my liking - a blend of Mediterranean and Asian influences. \u00a0We enjoyed the 18-course lunch tasting menu in their dining room which faces the hotel's internal garden. \u00a0Service was wonderful and non pretentious. \u00a0Our favorite dishes was a \"bloody mary\" consisting of tomato water and some awesome sorbet (tastes better than it sounds), a fried fish bone dish with foamed hollandaise (also tastes better than it sounds), and a bouillabaisse with broth that is boiled table side during the meal. Wonderful meal overall. I definitely recommend it. \u00a0Be ready to spend a long time there though. We got in at 1:30PM and left at 5PM!",
