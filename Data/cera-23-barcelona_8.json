    "I read the reviews and that led me to Cera 23. The restaurant is small so it's best to have reservations. We were led to a small table and the orange and white wall is not pleasant to look at so I made my husband face that while I faced out towards the restaurant. He did not like sitting looking at the busy wall- I think they should change it and make it stone or reclaimed wood. Then it would have a more inviting feel like the other side of the restaurant. We should have asked to move to a different table. The food is delicious here. I had the filet and potato dish and it was one of the best meals I had on vacation. The salt on the meat is flavorful. It was a nice thick piece of steak and it was a little too rare in the center for me. No worries the staff was fine to send it back and cook it a little more for me. When it came back it was cooked to my specified perfection and delicious. Would highly recommend.",
