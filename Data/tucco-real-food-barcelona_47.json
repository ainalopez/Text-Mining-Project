    "For other travellers this is how Tucco Real Food works:You order at the front counter and pay. You will be given a wooden spoon with a number on it. Take it and find yourself a table to the back of the restaurant. Most meals come in a combo with a drink and a dessert and are under 10\u20ac. If you order pasta you get to pick your sauce.We ordered pasta dishes and empanadas. Everything was very good and would make any homesick North American happy. The pastas are fresh and the sauces are tasty. The empanadas are some of the best I have had. The desserts are fine but not the stand out here. If you are looking for a quick and satisfying meal near the Gothic Quarter and don't want to pay tourist prices check out this restaurant.Special mention goes to the staff. The service was excellent. Fast, friendly and patient with our party of non-Spanish speakers (English). If I were in Barcelona longer I'd come back here to eat.",
