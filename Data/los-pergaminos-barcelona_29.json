    "Wonderful local family-owned place, off the beaten path. The walk to get here is almost as great as the food when you arrive! Delicious paella, the best that I had on my trip to Barcelona. Great selection of wine, and excellent sangria. The atmosphere is very cozy, with a very old-world feel about it. Staff literally was two women who did everything it seemed from waitressing to bartending to cooking the food! Excellent service, very friendly staff. Es necesario que pueda hablar espa\u00f1ol aunque porque las mujeres no sab\u00edan mucho ingl\u00e9s. Definitely recommended if you find yourself in Barcelona and in the mood for an authentic Spanish meal, through and through.",
