    "Brunch & Cake has a near-cult following among students who study abroad or visit Barcelona. And for good reason. It's so delicious and veers on the lighter, healthier side of brunch options (depending on if you get the cake). They really do have cake here, and I heard it's pretty damn good. Anyone who goes to Barcelona should try this place, especially assuming they have finished the road construction that prevented me from sitting outside last spring. While sitting in the sunny space, I drank cafe con leche as I debated on my meal. I ordered a bagel spread with bacon mashed potatoes and greens with truffle scrambled eggs. The bagel was different (lighter, less dense) than what I'm used to in the US, but still good. My friend got a quinoa burger that was honestly divine. The food is great, though the pricing is more than I would spend on an everyday basis.",
