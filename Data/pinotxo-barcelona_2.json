    "Touristy? Yes. Crowded? You bet. Totally worth the visit? A huge YES!!!We had breakfast at Pinotxo twice during our stay in Barcelona, and I firmly believe that everyone MUST experience the wonderfulness that is this bustling market stall eatery at least once! Juan and his crew whip up amazing dishes, including catalan-style tortilla with tomato bread (a MUST), delicious grilled and custard-filled pastries, and a litany of other Catalan tapas. The espresso, while by no means gourmet, really hits the spot and it's fun to watch Juan at work. \u00a0A word of note: This place gets CROWDED, so get here early for breakfast or be prepared to wait.",
