    "Unfortunately, my experience with this place in the peak summer heat has been very different from previous experiences. \u00a0It's overcrowded with tourists, the food quality is sub-par (not the best cuts of meat, somewhat undercooked) and it tasted like it had been sitting out for too long, which is probably what happened since it's served buffet-style and it is HOT in the summer.Also, more than once the server has mis-counted the number of skewers and overcharged me - I don't know if it's intentional or just an oversight because they're rushed, but it's really not cool. \u00a0So count your skewers before the server tallies them for the bill and make it clear that you're checking their math.",
