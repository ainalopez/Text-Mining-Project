    "I don't particularly care for Spanish food but this was great. Get there early. \u00a0Pink bread, bomba meat balls, papas bravas are excellent!!! \u00a0Filet in pepper sauce. \u00a0So good. \u00a0We had a large party so note it will be difficult to get seated. \u00a0Better experience than the 5 star AbAC restaurant; more food, less pricey and wasn't a 4 hour event.",
