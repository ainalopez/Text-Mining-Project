    "Great food. This place is super small, and the setup is weird. You have to wait outside if they are busy. Then one person comes up to get you drinks. Then another person will ask you what you want to eat (everything is out on the main bar). Then another person cooks it and brings it to you. Overall pretty confusing if you don't know what you are getting into. Also, there are no prices or descriptions on anything, but they do speak pretty good English.I have no idea what I tried, but everything was amazing and the bill for 2 people with a mojito and sangria was $25 (totally worth it).This was our best restaurant in Barcelona, highly recommend.",
