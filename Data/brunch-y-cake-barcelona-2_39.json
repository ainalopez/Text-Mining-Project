    "Great presentation of food.Mostly tasty food as well.Maybe on the sweeter side for some.Eggs Benedict was great, French toast w Nutella wasn't really French toast - bread didn't seem to have been soaked in egg batter. Nutella topping could have been a tad less sweeter.Cortado was served to me in a cup instead of glass.",
