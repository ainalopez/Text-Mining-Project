    "I'm halfway through my meal and I can already review this place. I know the type. The owner swindles you into drinking bottled water by saying that tap is \"unhealthy\" (here's a tip: That's a huge lie).The dishes are tasty but nothing too exemplary and their prices are definitely higher but not insane for some things. The braves were reasonably valued as was the cod.But the service leaves a lot to be desired. I had to practically force them to give me tap water. And yet here I am, still alive, writing this middling review. ;)Just ok. But the bonbon at the end was freaking good.",
