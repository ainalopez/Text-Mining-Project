    "We had the garlic steak bites, chicken skewers, bread with tomato, and calamari ring tapas and they were all equally delicious. Their sangria had the best flavor that I have had so far on our trip to Portugal and Spain, and the waitresses were quick and friendly. I would highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner.",
