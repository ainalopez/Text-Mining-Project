    "We selected this restaurant based strictly on Yelp reviews, and were not disappointed. \u00a0The dining room is very small...sleek and yet intimate. \u00a0There are at most ten tables. \u00a0 \u00a0All of the dishes were executed perfectly. \u00a0The Iberian ham and artichoke salad (which I couldn't wrap my head around before it was served) was a work of art, and it was delicious. \u00a0Light and very flavorful. \u00a0The wine list is small, but good, and not astronomically expensive. \u00a0 Service is warm and attentive. \u00a0One of the best meals we had in Barcelona.",
