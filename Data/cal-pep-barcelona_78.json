    "Overrated, overhyped and oversalted. That's my review of Cal Pep.Long wait for a seat at the bar? Si! Not worth it at all? Si! Si!Seriously, if I am going to wait 45 minutes to sit on a tiny bar stool and be treated with indifferent service by an unfriendly barman, the least the chef can do is learn to season his food properly. But No! Every bite was too salty. I left hungry and thirsty! We had the tasting menu, which looked like a good variety when we watched others getting served, but by the second course of clams drenched in salt, I didn't want any more.This place was also overpriced. Ugh. I am so sad I wasted one of three dinners in Barcelona at Cal Pep, and I am annoyed at my husband's friend for raving about it so much that we felt we had to go. Yuck.",
