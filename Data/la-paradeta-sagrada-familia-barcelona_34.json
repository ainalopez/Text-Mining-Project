    "BEWARE!!!!!!! ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!! I just left this filthy restaurant and I will never come back and neither should you.I witnessed what appeared to be the chef grab a handful of shrimp with his gloved hands, place it on the grill then walked over to the side window (where you drop off your used plates/trash) and picked up the used plates AND STARTED WASHING THE DISHES WITH THE SAME GLOVES!!!!! Yuckkkkk!! It doesn't stop there. I thought no this can't be, he didn't just do that did he? Then he walked back over to the grill, picked up MORE FOOD with the same gloves and began cooking!!!! I couldn't believe my eyes!!! Not only did he come back to wash more dishes, he kept cooking with the same gloves!!!!! I watched him for about 15 minutes and not once did he change gloves. How disgusting and unsanitary is that?! I was so disgusted I immediately left feeling sick to my stomach. Overall, this was not worth the wait in line and the terrible and rude customer service by the man behind the counter/cash register who appeared to be Asian whom hurried me in placing my order and insisted on making me make my final decision or to go to the back of the line, wait again and think about what I wanted. HOW RUDE!! IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT GOING TO THIS DISGUSTING PLACE!!!!!! IF YOU DO, KEEP IN MIND ABOUT ALL THE BACTERIA AND GERMS YOU JUST ATE BECAUSE OF THIS NASTY CARELESS \u00a0\"CHEF\". \u00a0BEWARE!!!",
