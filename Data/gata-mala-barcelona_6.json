    "My husband and I are visiting Barcelona from the US and came here for dinner. The place is great! Very kind servers. Funky ambiance, a bit hipster. It is quite small, so get there before 9 if you want seats. When you order an alcoholic beverage, you get a tapa for free....real, freshly made tapas! Wow, so yummy! And the prices are great!",
