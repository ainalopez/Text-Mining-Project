    "What's a trip to Spain without paella?Despite the popularity of this place, we were seated immediately because 'it's a game night' said the waiter as he led us to our table.We ordered:- the house salad (olive/anchovy/cod carpaccio/lettuces)- Catalan sausage with potatoes- traditional rabbit and snail paellaThe cod in the salad and the green olives were excellent, but the overall effect was diminished by the overabundance of tuna, making the whole thing a bit tuna salad-ish, as well as some mushy black olives.The Catalan sausage was great. I find the spices in this type of sausage reminiscent of breakfast sausages, but my mom loves it. And even through the breakfast sausage haze I ate more of it that she did.Now, ordering the rabbit/snail option instead of the seafood option was a nod to tradition rather than preference. I always prefer seafood. But I figured I can get the kind of seafood that comes in seafood paella (shrimp, mussels, squid) anywhere, whereas rabbit/snail is a more unusual combination.The types of snails they use are the slimy ones found in oc len xao dua (Vietnamese coconut snails), not the big French escargot. Thankfully, these weren't too slimy, and slipped from their shells easily. The rabbit, too, was well cooked and came freely from its bones. But the best part? The rice. The rice is what my mom and I fought over at the end. It was crunchy on the bottom like the rice in Korean clay pot dishes and a bright red-orange from the spices and the huge pimentos that lay on top of the bowl like wrapping paper.",
