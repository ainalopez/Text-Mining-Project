    "If you can manage to grab a table, this place is fantastic. Our favorite tapas location of all the places we tried! I usually hate going to the same restaurant when traveling, but would've made an exception for this place (however, they closed by the time we got there). Even though we went there once, the guy closing up was actually our amazing waiter and he recognized us! He scolded us for going elsewhere but we countered back that if they weren't closing, we were going to go in. Anyways, food is delicious and very reasonably priced! The house cava (local white wine) is on the sweeter side and very easy to drink.. maybe a little too easy ;D The white anchovies were addicting as was the calamari. The snail eaters of the group enjoyed the dish while the non-snail eaters wasn't too fond of them (they did like them at another tapas place though). The omelet came out hot and was very filling. The tomato bread was a bit too wet for me, but was still great with the anchovies.We had manage to grab a standing table but our superhero waiter was able to get a sit-down table of us (which the girls greatly needed from the day's excursion). Watching him running around all night was crazy. Don't know how he manages to remember everyone's order (he didn't write anything down) and have them coming out fairly quickly (and correct) as well. He was so friendly and cheerful the whole night. We HAD to give him a big tip (which apparently goes into a house pot) so they rang a bell and cheered. How fun!Definitely try to have some patience to get a table. It's worth the wait!",
