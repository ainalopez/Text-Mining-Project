    "I am one for elaborate reviews and stories around my experience. But for Vinitus I don't have many words, in fact I was rendered a little speechless. This little piece of heaven has amazing Tapas, brilliant Pintxos and the wines......ah the wines.... The service is polite and around when you need them. Exactly how it should be. Since we didn't meet Vinitus until a couple hours before our flight back to Amsterdam we only visited it once during our stay. But one things is for sure.....Vinitus when I am back in Beautiful Barca, you will be seeing me as you are now my new love!and oh yeah....it is still very reasonably priced :)",
