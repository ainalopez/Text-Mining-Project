    "I really have to say thank you to fellow Yelpers for being clear on the timetable and the wait. My family and I showed up right when Ramen-Ya Hiro opens in the afternoon, and we were seated outside on a wet day in Barcelona. I wasn't quite sure what to expect for a ramen joint in Spain, but the miso ramen I ordered was decent. I wasn't blown away by it, and my brother and I thought the soup had a weird/different taste to it that was unexpected. It was definitely flavorful, but pulled away from the actual miso flavor. We also had the gyoza - nothing very special and expensive for what it is. Service was quite slow and not terribly helpful. Our menus were in Japanese and Spanish only, so between the Japanese I learned 8 years ago and the Spanish we could pick up, my family and I could decipher a basic version of the menu!",
