    "Excelente from beginning to end. Great service and food and I will definitely come back next time I am in Barcelona. The sampler of empanadas were \"home made\" fresh and all very tasty (one cheese and onion, one beef, one ham and cheese, and one corn). The bread was served with an Argentinian oil sauce on the side that was very good, flavor I had not had elsewhere and would love to have again. I ordered the sirloin with potato (with a whipped cheese topping - absolutely delicious!!!) and the grilled vegetables (nothing to speak of here, grilled vegetables are grilled vegetables. However, they included a variety and part of a potato with the grilled vegetables side). For desert I had the raspberry tartlet which was also very good. Two thumbs up!",
