    "We had no reservation and the inside was packed but we were able to sit outside. The food was wonderful and went well with a Catalan white wine our server recommended. We had the pumpkin ravioli, patatas bravas, salmon sashimi on endives, and a green salad with fried Brie. Dessert was an Espuma Creme de Catalan, amazing. Stuffed, but oh so content! We'd go back again!",
