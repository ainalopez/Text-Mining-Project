    "Ridiculously good meal. The Foie gras with white chocolate was a show stopper. Sea bass was the best a companion ever had. Beef carpaccio and artichokes were phenomenal. And many more, but still not all we wanted to try. We've had so many good meals in Barcelona, thanks to the guidance of Yelpers, but this is the one we might go back to.",
