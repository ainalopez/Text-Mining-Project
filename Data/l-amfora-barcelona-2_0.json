    "I was in town for a business conference and we stopped in based a recommendation that someone in our party gave and we weren't disappointed. \u00a0Their sangria was delicious. \u00a0The sea bass cooked in salt was wonderful, others in our group had it. \u00a0I recommend reservations if you have a larger group because the place is smaller.",
