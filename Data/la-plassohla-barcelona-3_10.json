    "The service here was not great and the food was over priced for the quality. They messed up our order twice, but quickly corrected it. There is a lot of seafood and shellfish on a limited menu, so be prepared for that. All in all it's okay, but there are so many better places in Barcelona. Don't waste your time or money here.",
