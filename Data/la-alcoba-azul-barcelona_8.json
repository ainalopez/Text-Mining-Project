    "This place is amazing! Tuck away in a quiet, narrow alleyway with only faint neon blue light letting you know that there is a restaurant there. \u00a0This was a place recommended by my English-speaking tour guide and this place definitely was one of the best restaurants I dined at in Barcelona. \u00a0They have an open kitchen so you can watch the food being prepared. \u00a0Everything I ordered tasted delicious and the dessert was on the house. \u00a0The prices were very reasonable. Definitely recommended!",
