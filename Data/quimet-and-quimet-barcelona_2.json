    "World's best Tapas place beware, there is something about this place that is charming and energetically tasty. You are force to stand only and rub shoulders with everyone. Good quality is great? razor clam is cold! Wine by the glass is good and the house beer is sweet! Lots of mixed tourist and local Spaniards!We just came back from a hike to the funicular, Castle and Olympic park, QYQ sure hits the spot!See you all soon.",
