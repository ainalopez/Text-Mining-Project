    "This place was amazing!! It was the best bang for your buck, filled with only locals and really great food. WE all got coffee, desserts, appetizers and maincourse and still the cost was lower than what we paid at all the \"tourist traps\" - great recommendation by our friends (from LA). The restaurant itself was so cute! They had their menu listed on wine bottles. Most noteworthy - the desserts! the tiramisu and the mango yogurt cake was to DIE for! The vegetarian main course (gnnochi in hazelnut cream and mushrooms was ok. Kind of heavy because of the cream) but the boys ordered chicken with dates/olives and Salmon baked in a parchment paper and they licked their plates dry.Your next trip to Barcelona, add this quaint restaurant to your itinerary.",
