    "After visiting Barcelona a few times the last months We were looking for a new spot to enjoy some good food and more important the atmosphere... We booked a table at Boca Grande as we were told that's the place to go...When arriving we standing in a line waiting to be attended, and while asking if we had a reservation and picking up the phone we ended up getting a really bad located table - after talking to the her once again, and trying to explain that we didn't what that table, we were moved to a corner - far away from any atmosphere.Food - the quality is really good, but be prepared to pay big time if you say yes to \"today's fresh fish\" without a price on!! 4 Prawns = 31 euro (nothing else served) Service wasn't great and it seemed like they most of all just wanted you out so overall really sad experience... Wouldn't suggest my business associates or friend to go there.",
