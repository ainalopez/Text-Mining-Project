    "La Bodegueta is partially underground, so make sure you don't walk right past it. We sat outside in the middle of Rambla de Catalunya, which is one of my favorite things to do. It was pretty busy at lunch time, but not hard to get a server. We ordered the pa amb tomaquet \u00a0(bread with olive oil and tomato) just about everywhere we went, and here it was very good. We also got the ham sandwich and it was just too oily for me. It wasn't something I would order again. The manchego cheese was very good. Overall a nice lunch spot, but I wish I would have tried the croquetas!",
