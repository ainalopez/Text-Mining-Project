    "This was one of our favorite places that we ate in Spain. We found everyone to be pretty friendly and easy to interact with (we ordered in spanish but I don't think anyone thought we were anything but tourists). We went with what everyone else seemed to be getting. One of my favorite dishes was the fried artichokes. My partner particularly enjoyed the chorizo dish. The dishes were small enough to try a few different things.",
