    "Excellent place !! Really happy we found it because of yelp reviews. They made a veggie paella for me that they didn't have on the menu and it was so so delicious. Coffee is really good and of course you have to do fresh orange juice when in Barcelona. Very cute place with good views of the sagrada familia and super service. I would definitely come back when visiting.",
