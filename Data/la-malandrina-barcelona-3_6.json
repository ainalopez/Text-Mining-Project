    "I have wonderful dreams about this magnificent restaurant. Alex T. and I were visiting Barcelona and got into the city kind of late. Luckily, businesses in Barcelona stay open late. Yay!Since we don't speak much Catalan and were trying to navigate the alleyways and streets in the dark, it was a little hard to find. They also had some construction happening outside so the sign was slightly hidden, but man, the effort was worth it!The servers and bartenders were very nice and patient with us and we tried our best to communicate. The menu has English translations too. The sirloin was amazing. Juicy and tender and cooked to perfection. The fries were fresh and yummy, but the papas con Crema were amazing. So good. Like I said, I dream of this place. The prices are ridiculously cheap. 9EUR for a plate?Be sure I drown everything in their heavenly chimichurri and other sauces available at the table.The place is small, so be prepared to wait a little while during peak hours. So worth it.",
