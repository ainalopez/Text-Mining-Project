    "We dined here three days in a row during our trip to Spain and since then, we have not been able to stop thinking of the food and overall experience.We were so lost trying to order but put your trust in the owner and he will not steer you wrong. He served us cockles SO GOOD - it was hands down the BEST thing we ate the whole week we were in Barcelona. It gets extremely crowded so go as early as possible. It is not unusual to see people eating tripe or stew with wine or whisky at 9AM in the morning. We stuck to the caffe con leche which we could not stop ordering! If you need someone English speaking, ask for Javier! \u00a0He looks like the younger version of Justin Timberlake - so adorable!=====AlgonGirls.com",
