    "Delightful vegan restaurant on a small street just a couple blocks off Las Ramblas. Crowded at American lunchtime, but by 3 fairly easy to be promptly seated. Great selection of fresh veggies, juices and smoothies in delicious combos. Go for the especialities of the week. Have to say this is another fine find thru Yelp.",
