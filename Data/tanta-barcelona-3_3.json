    "Great food. You do get what you pay for here with huge portion sizes. If you are a big eater, this is the place to go! Otherwise I would think twice about ordering additional dishes. We had the fried Empanadas which were crunchy and great. Even the bread was awesome. For mains, we had the lamb shank and the duck nortano, both excellent, but massive portions. We got our leftovers in a take away container.",
