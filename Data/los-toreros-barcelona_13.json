    "end up at the place because of so many positive reviews. \u00a0We had six different tapas... sea snails no good at all, blood sausage with fried onion not bad, grilled calamity ok, sliced ham horrendous (i did not think it was possible to have bad ham in Spain), baby octopus also no good (rubbery, tiny, oily over-fried) \u00a0...service less then OK, traditional decor could have been been enjoyable if the food be any good",
