    "The food here is delicious! We had a huge group so we tried and shared a lot off the menu, the salads, benedicts, etc. Everything was a hit.The only thing that was a miss were the pancakes. They were really dry, covered in too much syrup, and not fluffy at all. The space is small and packed, wait can be pretty long depending the size of your group and time of day. The staff there are accommodating and friendly (however there was a male waiter who didn't seem to pleased that we were there).",
