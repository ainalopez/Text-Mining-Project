    "I came here because I was sick, and sick and tired of packs and packs of tourists. There's always a risk at eating somewhere where there aren't tons of people, but the menu seemed solid enough. \u00a0The inside was much larger than expected. I was seated by a tiny man (say this as he was smaller than me, and I'm 5\"1\") who figured out immediately that I needed the tourist menu. It's the tourist menu because it was in multiple languages. \u00a0Most of their foods are meat heavy, and they have a large, oak wood grill that provided a lovely smoke to their dishes. \u00a0I got the Catalan toast, and a duck dish, and crema catalana to finish it off. \u00a0The toast was better than most options I've had. Served with a very garlicky mayo, it as very flavorful and properly seasoned. \u00a0The duck was a bit rubbery, but the vegetables with it were great. \u00a0The crema catalana was just what I wanted, but nothing to write home about.If I'm here, I'd not go there unless everything else is just overwhelming me, but I don't regret the decision at all.",
