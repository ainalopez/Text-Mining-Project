    "Since we got back from LA, going to Japanese and Mexican restaurant it has been a huge disappointment. I know I will have to pay a lot of money to get good sushi in Barcelona. But we are still trying to get an affordable japanese that serve more than salmon and tuna. This one opo out the other day on yelp. Located in carrer Escudellers, 50 yards from las Ramblas, it is very close to our place. It's is quiet small, with 7-8 small tables and the menu is limited. But it is run by japanese (a good sign). We got 2 starters, a fried ball with octopus and one fried patty made with pumpkin. And a combination of sushi with a roll. The starters were excellent. Sushi was looking good, with 6 nigiris, with 5-6 types of fish. One of them was fresh raw shrimp, something that you can only get in a more expensive restaurant. My only complain was the rice. I found it was a kind of undercooked or dry. That's why I am giving them a 3 starts instead of 4. We got a strawberry mochi that was really good. I will be back and I promise to review my rating.EDIT, the rice is good so as I promised I edit my review, give then a 4,5 that means 5 starts. I have found my walking distance Japanese in Barcelona",
