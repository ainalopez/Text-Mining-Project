    "Sushi was great. I enjoyed it but the restaurant itself was plain. There was no decor and you are surrounded by white walls. The servers were not friendly at all as they did not have a menu in English. We did not understand the menu since it was in Catalan and they just didn't want to explain, so husband and I winged it. Ordered:Two watersChicken Udon soup- very tastySalmon Roe Fish Egg sushi- (it was supposed to be a salmon skin roll) but it was ok the fish eggs came out frozen though.Soft Shell Crab Roll- on the menu it only said Soft Shell crab so we didn't realize it was an actual ROLL with 6 piecesShrimp Tempura Roll- which came out great and the batter was very light.Total Spent was 64Euros. It was decent but it would have been nice if we knew what we were ordering and the servers could have been more helpful.",
