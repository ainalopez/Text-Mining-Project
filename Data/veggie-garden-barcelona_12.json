    "Several friends recommended Veggie Garden as the MUST visit Vegan restaurant in town. I wasn't super wowed, but wouldn't say my meal was bad either.With so many other places that wowed me during our 4 days. I wouldn't rush back as there were still several places to try, but I would give this place another go.",
