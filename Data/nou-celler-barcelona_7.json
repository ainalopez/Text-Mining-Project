    "Its ok ... So we stopped by the Picasso Museum and we found what we thought was a little gem. Ok, so at 13.99 Euro per person, we thought, hey that's not bad and in we go. Waited at the bar for about 30-45 minutes, my vino cost about 3 Euro which is a pretty small goblet glass. When we finally got seated, we pretty much got served right away. Their fried anchovies were good, the stewed baby octopus doesn't really cut our taste. But its not it that made us dock 2 stars. Its the wait and they forgot to give us a squid dish that we ordered for appetizer. Server said that its because we're busy and we dont have time to check what dishes comes out - not a good answer (period) coming from someone who is a old time fine dining server. Anyway, my food got out cold, so I had it re-heated. All in all, its an \"ok\" experience. I'm sure its a good hit for the locals since some of the restaurant are all spread out, but I wont make the effort to come back here. Its hard enough to find any restaurant in Born. I'm sure other patrons will have a better experience - but not us.",
