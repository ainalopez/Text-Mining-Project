    "Food is amazing !!!!Worth the wait ... Get there early so you have a chance to choose from all of their fresh daily specials .The Parrillada de Mariscos is amazing, razor clams are cooked to perfection ...Try the Zetas ( saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on a garlic, scallions and olive oil )Their vegetables mix is a must !!! They cook them to perfection. Food is so fresh because they get all their produce from the market every day.Same with seafood, they get it early morning from the fisherman's from the same market.If you are insecure about what to order... don't worry !!! Ask any of the chefs to recommend something ....Everything is delicious so don't hesitate, and please do yourself a favor, order a glass of wine with your food ... Enjoy the true Barcelona lifestyle while delighting yourself with exquisite food . \u00a0Saludos al Gato desde California !!Gracias por la deliciosa comida.",
