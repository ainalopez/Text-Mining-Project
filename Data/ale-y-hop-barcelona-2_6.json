    "These are the most creative veggie burgers I've ever had. I love that they're not content with one kind. They have three on the menu, and I had the lentil with dill and mustard. My husband had the chickpea with beet, rhubarb and wasabi. I loved mine, but I wanted to eat his, too. The bun is nice and flaky like saltines. They come with big fat chewy sweet potato wedges with aioli. The craft beers are very hoppy, which is what American hipsters like, and they were there in numbers. A very drunk girl hurt the bartender's feelings by telling her she looked like Lena Dunham. \"You know who she is? Do you watch the show Girls? But you're prettier than she is.\" After they paid I told the bartender she didn't look like her and not to let it ruin her night. She thanked me and said another guy asked if she was pregnant earlier and maybe people are just jerks on Mondays. Anyway, if you like good veggie burgers and hoppy craft beer and cheese -- they have an excellent cheese plate, but they only do the board. They don't serve it tapas style, which is weird in Spain, and they don't let you taste the beer. You have to buy the 1.5 euro flight of three shots of beer. That said, go here.",
