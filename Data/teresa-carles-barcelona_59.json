    "Great food - cocktail salad was wonderful. \u00a0Mini vegan burgers were great, the beetroot was the best. \u00a0My wife had the vegan ceviche. \u00a0Very intense seaweed so if you're shy of it at all, you may want to steer clear. \u00a0However, she loved it. \u00a0Ordered green medicine juice (superb), ordered the juice \"salad on the go\" but they informed us that they were out of the ingredients to make. \u00a0We also ordered the kale salad but we were told neither store had any kale. \u00a0After buying juices at the other shop we saw a large amount of kale...kinda weird? \u00a0Service was very subpar but food is too good not to go back. Multiple waiters but seemed very uninterested in helping.",
