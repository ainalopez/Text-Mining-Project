    "Read the reviews of others and were not disappointed! Would recommend to others.The salads are huge..could easily share.I had a tomatoes blue cheese salad, large slices of tomato alternating with mild onion,with plenty of great blue cheese spread around, had a balsamic glaze , and olive oil.my husband had the green salad with Tuna, again large salad but delicious. I had vegetable paella..was very good, asparagus, eggplant mushrooms, peas etc,Husband had the rabbit..he loved it. We splurged and had the flan with ice cream for dessert..again wow!The people \u00a0are very nice, the chef came around asking how the food was.A great eating experience,Pricing reasonable.",
