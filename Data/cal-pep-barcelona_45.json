    "Turned out to be a perfect last night dinner for us in Barcelona. Original choice was closing and we asked owner for recommendation and he sent us here. Busy on a Monday night at 9:00 pm. Counter is place to be, we waited 15 minutes for spot. Staff is fun and friendly. We asked for menu: told none, \"recommendations only\". Had clams, calamari, tomato bread, special omelette and monkfish. I'm not a fish eater and the monkfish was outstanding. They wouldn't say what was in the omelette. It wasn't big but it was just OK. Could skip that but overall great experience. With drinks , dinner for 3 was 90 euros.",
