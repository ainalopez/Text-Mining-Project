    "It was meh.A victim of its good yelp review. I was expecting more from this place.Ordered the duck timable and it was great.Everything just went down hill from there.Other dishes I ordered was average. Or its just that the other places I've been to for tapas was much better. And set the standard I have really high.I ordered the mini burger and it just tasted like salt. Would you like some bread for your salt patties? The paella were meh. Again, it could have been that the first place I've been to for paella was really good and set an unreasonable expectation.The service was kinda disappointing.We had 2 servers.The woman helping us was really nice and all, but she messed up our order a few times.The guy server gave a vibe that he didn't like tourists. It wasn't really a language issue because when he spoke, it was easy to understand. It was just an aura about him and didn't seem friendly.",
