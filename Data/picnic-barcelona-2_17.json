    "All the reviews here were raving about brunch, so I was a little hesitant to go for dinner. Picnic didn't disappoint. There was a fairly large group that arrived ahead of us, and the menu was pretty small (5 apps, 5 seafood dishes, and maybe 6-7 meat dishes), so they were out of three of the seafood dishes. That didn't matter, though. We ordered the grilled octopus and pulled pork tacos - both very well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The decor inside is cute; very home-y looking and you can watch the chef prepare all the food. That meant we saw every plate that came out of the kitchen, and wanted all of them. \u00a0The service is friendly, too, but nothing over the top. If you're headed for dinner, know that you'll be satisfied.",
