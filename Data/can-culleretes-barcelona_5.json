    "Had the spinach cannelloni \u00a0and it was yummmm! \u00a0Very rich and cheesy. \u00a0Also had the classic rice dish which is similar to paella except watery. \u00a0 Only got that because no paella at that time. \u00a0Took a while to order due to our lack of Spanish... But we got it done. \u00a0All the food around us looked amazing. And we'd wished we had asked for the English menu! \u00a0LolThis place was hopping. \u00a0They totally deserve 5 stars with 228 years in biz and still packing them in.",
