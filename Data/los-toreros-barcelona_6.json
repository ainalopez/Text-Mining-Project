    "The worst meal we had in Barcelona. Not sure how this place has 4 stars. It's not a one star, because the food is edible but it is two stars because it tasted bad. We had the seafood paella (which was NOT good), and a few other items off the tapas menu which were equally as poor. The food didn't taste fresh but the service was ok. I would not come back here and wanted to make sure more yelpers didn't get burned by the 4 star rating like we did",
