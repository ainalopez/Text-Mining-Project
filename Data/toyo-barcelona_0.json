    "I came on a Saturday night with two girlfriends. We came at 8:10 and there was already a line in the front. We were seated promptly at 8:35 and food was brought to us within five minutes. This place is a set Buffett menu, so they choose the food you receive but you can reorder dishes you like. We got dumplings, barbecue noodles, fried rice, a tray of salmon and tuna sushi and maki, a tray of spring rolls, shrimp, edamame, tonkatsu, asparagus, mushrooms, and green tea. The food was good and plentiful. While the sushi wasn't the MOST fresh in the world, it was still pretty fresh and tasty for the price that we are paying per person. The dumplings were savory, the BBQ noodles to be honest, were a bit weird but still tasty enough to eat, and the salmon/tuna sushi was pretty delicious. There was a salmon maki (six pieces of the rolls), a salmon sushi with onion and chives and a oyster-like sauce on the top (I really enjoyed the harshness of the onion and chives with the salmon), and sashimi. We were given the option to order duplicates of what we were previously served and we happily obliged. Would come back again before I leave Barcelona!",
