    "Great pasta place! Many tourists come here in my experience, but it's still a really great place to go get pasta.The food is really good, I've never been disappointed with anything I've eaten here. The pasta is really really good, as can be expected at a pasta bar.It's an interesting way of ordering too, you have this long list of options and ingredients, and at the end you have to choose a combination.It is not authentic Catalan or really Barcelona, but it's one of the most acceptable un-Catalan, and sort of touristy restaurants in Gr\u00e0cia.They're very nice, and always attentive.Inside it is really cool looking, very pretty.I would recommend it for an inexpensive, quick, but legitimately good meal.",
