    "Absolutely amazing food! This was the best dining experience of my entire vacation in Barcelona, and one of the top Italian restaurant I've ever been to. And I've been to many, including ones in Italy! The food was delicious (I had the caprese, the fettucine gorgonzola and the tiramisu) and the staff was beyond gracious. In a country where the servers don't work for tips and where most are rude as hell, it was refreshing to see dining service done right.A must for any foodie visiting Barcelona! Also, I loved the \"antique shop\" style decor. :-)",
