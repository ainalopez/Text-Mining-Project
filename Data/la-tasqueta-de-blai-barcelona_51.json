    "This is one of my favorite places for tapeo/pintxos on Carrer Blai. The place is always packed, but if you can get in, the atmosphere is fun and the food is good. Generous portions for the price of only \u20ac1 per pintxo. I take off 1 star for the terrible rioja - it's literally the worst wine I've drank anywhere in Barcelona.",
