    "This place sure is fun. They serve basque pintxos, which are small snacks on bread, held together by a toothpick. You can pick and mix as much as you like, and afterwards the toothpicks are added up (2 Euros per piece) and you pay for that. The ones I had were quite good, however to properly fill you up will rip quite a hole in your pocket. So this place is more of a quick snack stop rather than a proper 'meal restaurant'. Delicious though, no question.",
