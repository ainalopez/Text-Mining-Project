    "Hmmmmm. Well, the burgers are large and the meat is pretty solid. Fries are pretty well done, though a bit flavorless. However the buns are terrible - way too thick and large, flavorless bread that crumbles two minutes after you get your order. The service was surly and unhelpful (e.g. We tried to order a veggie patty with different toppings than what the menu suggests...and were told repeatedly no). The sauces were just ok. And the prices can get fairly high if you want any extras or order any drinks. Maybe we are biased being from the United States, but there are fast food joints and chains that do burgers better (In n Out, Five Guys, Red Robin) much less restaurants. So...a solid meh.",
