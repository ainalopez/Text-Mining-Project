    "Very nice Thai place in Barcelona. The food is excellent, the service good. The place is very chilled out and relaxed, the play chill out music and the street right next to it, which is filled with plants and flowers and jasmine, makes you feel like you encountered an oasis in the middle of Barcelona. The place is rather small and usually it is difficult to get a table. The tables and chairs give you the impression that this is rather a place for a small snack, but the food proves you otherwise. We had crispy prawns and minced chicken salad for starters, both delicious. The main was comprised of red duck curry and a more spicy chicken curry and again both very mouthwatering. To finish up we enjoyed some thick rice with mango, that was great but we felt the portion was a little small for the five Euros we had to spent on it. The rest of the food was priced rather cheap than expensive, the mains go for around 8 to 10 Euros and the starters around 4 to 6. All in all, a very nice place to satisfy your curry cravings with good friends. Go check it out.",
