    "We stumbled upon Flax & Kale while wandering Barcelona and it made me the happiest traveler. Their flexitarian offerings were diverse, plentiful, and intriguing...so naturally we went for breakfast and dinner. The juice selection was insanely awesome, and I had to contain myself from purchasing more than a person could reasonably expect to drink in one day alone. \u00a0The smoothie bowl I had for breakfast was something I plan to (try and) replicate at home: a\u00e7ai berry, goji berries, GF granola, nuts and seeds, berries...perfection. For dinner, the watermelon salad was clutch and the tuna burger was inspiring, if that's an acceptable term to describe food. The only disappointment, was the \"rainbow\" cake--with flavors and colors from beets, turmeric, matcha, etc. The turmeric one was particularly unpleasant, and I had a feeling even when I ordered it. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose! Still, an excellent meal in a beautiful space with a lovely staff!",
