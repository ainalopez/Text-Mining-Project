    "Wow is all I can say! I am extremely indecisive (so is my mother and sister) which made choosing restaurants annoying and time consuming for us during our stay in Barcelona. I turned to yelp to help us decide on a place for our last dinner of the trip. After a few meals in lackluster, expensive, tourist traps, it was time to get serious. Tosca was the winner, and boy am I glad it was! I was shocked that I hadn't noticed it earlier, but I was probably distracted by the beautiful building across the street. We ordered a few tapas selections (salmon, pizza, empanadas, potato wedges) and everything was exceptional. We loved the creativity of the flavor combinations and every detail was completely spot on! The drinks were also great and very reasonably priced. Next trip to BCN I will make sure to visit this hidden gem.",
