    "The terrace here in 1st floor, in sunny time, is like we are in heaven. After a shopping, for a bit of extraction from the crowds, it's perfect for lunch.They have the best paella that we taste this trip in Barcelona.Starters were nothing special. Also notice that this is restaurant is to me really over expensive.",
