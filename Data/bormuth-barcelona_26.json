    "We accidentally popped in here after walking all over looking for just the right spot. \u00a0We were seated right away even though they were busy. \u00a0Everyone was super friendly & displayed great team work. \u00a0We were very attended to. \u00a0The food was delish, the caipirinha refreshing & the vino yummy. \u00a0This young hip place is a definite keeper.",
