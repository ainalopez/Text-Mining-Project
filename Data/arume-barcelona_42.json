    "In the seedy neighborhood of Raval, this place is a gem. No problem with reservations and I highly suggest making one. Short, but great cocktail menu. The blackberry mojito was amazing. Sampled many of the tapas and found all equally excellent. We liked the grilled octopus with the potato mousse the best. The desert, (Galician something) was also outstanding. Not too sweet. Very friendly staff and one of the co-owners, Eduardo, was kind enough to even walk us out to the larger street where we could call a taxi. \u00a0Everyone spoke English, which came handy, as most of the clientele were foreigners. The price is right!",
