    "12 prior ratings said 5 stars. \u00a0I am not sure if I am happier with Didac - the wonderful host and his girlfriend - or Yelp. \u00a0Lean in and celebrate your life and dinner companion if you can possibly surrender an evening at Estapes. \u00a0A reservation is recommended. \u00a0We got lucky.My wife and I had the tasting menu with the wine pairings. \u00a0Each wine from a different Catalan region was described with colorful notes and purpose for pairing by Didac. I covet his 600 bottle cellar. Each dish was wonderfully prepared, beautifully plated and as delicate as it was delicious. The entire meal was paced, served and balanced. Nothing pretentious about the seating but location is beautiful and every serving arrived with pride and the joy of owners doing what they love. \u00a0We left completely sated in every way.For $100 per person at the current dollar exchange rate, you will feel like you stole it.",
