    "We arrived here early for lunch. \u00a0Good thing because it became very crowded very quickly.Originally we set out for a walk along the ocean and I told my wife I'd like some seafood. \u00a0When we walked by La Barca and I read there menu, it took me about 10 seconds to decide I wanted their Imperial Special for two.The place was already buzzing as we were ushered to our table. \u00a0Started off with a nice Alsacian beer, AK Damm, olives, and tomato bread.The waiter asked if we'd like any mayo, garlic spread, etc for our seafood. \u00a0I told him I wasn't sure, so he brought us all 3. \u00a0Note: loved the garlic spread and the other tomato vinegar like spread.So then the imperial platter arrived. \u00a0I do not joke when I say it was enormous! \u00a0The platter ran the length of our table and was piled high with muscles, clams, razor clams, lobster, shrimp, prawns, and langoustines. Now that's how you get your seafood fix!Yes it was pricy at \u20ac96 for the two of us, but worth every penny. \u00a0We couldn't even finish it.And when they brought the check, they also brought us complimentary grappa and cakes. \u00a0Simply wonderful! \u00a0This will always be a mandatory stop for us.",
