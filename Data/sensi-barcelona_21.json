    "People of 2, ordered 3 dishes, and 2 glasses of sangria. A dish of croquette of maybe salmon flavor, duck timbale, small size of paella. Croquette is absolutely amazing. You got the crunchy texture for the first bite, then the strong salmon aroma hit you right off the bat, come along with the mushy texture.Thumbs up. Duck timbale with potatoes is much my type of food as well, all ingredients bind perfectly. Be aware of not being hungry, small size of paella is just about the right portion to satisfy us. Staffs are extremely friendly and helpful, they are not being eager to push you order dishes as many as possible, rather, being patient to explain each of the dishes. Honestly, I didn't expect their service would be as brilliant as the meal they serve.If you were in Barcelona, this would be a MUST visit spot for meal.",
