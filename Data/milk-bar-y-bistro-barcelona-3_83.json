    "Recommended!! ...Long overdue review but my husband and I were fortunate enough to stumble upon this wonderful establishment on a recent trip to Spain. The service was prompt, friendly and courteous. The food was quite tasty, American fare. Cool vibe with a cozy decor. We had the privilege of meeting the owner who was really nice and spoke English. We will definitely return!",
