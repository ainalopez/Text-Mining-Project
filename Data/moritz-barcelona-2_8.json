    "Given the eccentric and delicious menu, I want to give the place 5 stars. Gooseneck barnacles were excellent and so was the Russian salad. For the adventurous eater, I would highly recommend trying both. The Russian salad was loaded with Iberian sausage. However, service left much to be desired and although tempting, I can't give this place 5 stars. We literally had to wait about 30 minutes after our table was cleaned for the waitress to bring a check.",
