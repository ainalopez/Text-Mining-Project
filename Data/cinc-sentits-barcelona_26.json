    "It's been awhile since we visited Cinc Sentits when writing this review. \u00a0But I do remember I was really impressed with their amuse bouche...or was it their appetizer? \u00a0I don't remember. \u00a0But the maple syrup amuse bouche was outstanding!! \u00a0I heard the chef was from Canada...so perhaps that was an ode to Canada? :)I was also equally impressed with their foie gras. \u00a0I think it was the best foie gras I've had to date! \u00a0And I normally don't like foie gras too much since I find it realllly rich. \u00a0But Cinc Sentits did an awesome job with the carmelized sugar on the foie gras that gave it a nice crunchy sweet texture!I loved the unique and creative dish with the romesco sauce and sardines (although the hubby did not enjoy the sardines as much). \u00a0Very creative!Service was good and attentive (but not as good as service at other Michelin star restaurants I've been to).Save up your Euros b/c this place is pricey!!! \u00a0But worth a splurge. \u00a0 Enjoy! :)",
