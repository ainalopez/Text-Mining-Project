    "Though others (including my gf) liked the fishermans stew, \u00a0I had the set dinner and was pleasantly impressed. \u00a0Way too much food for me, \u00a0but it was a great mix because I ended up giving my dessert to the GF.The food had a great flavor to it, the ambiance was nice, and the sangria was very nice.Would come back, and would recommend to anyone looking for a \u00a0quiet bistro.",
