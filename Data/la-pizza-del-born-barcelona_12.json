    "i wonder if spaniards eat pizza on drunken late-nights like americans do. \u00a0it seemed that way on sat night, b/c the joint was packed. \u00a0this place is like the golden boy (sf pizza place in north beach) of barcelona. \u00a0go to the counter, pick the slices you want (they have a ton of variety), and they will heat them up for you. \u00a0if you're a veg, there are a lot of options here for you.",
