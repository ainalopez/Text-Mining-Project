    "Picasso held his first solo exhibit in the main room of this restaurant, which was the main reason we decided to check it out. The interior of the restaurant bustles with culture, including several paintings and tile art. It's a \u00a0small but quaint place, perfect for a nice break after taking a stroll along the Barri Gotic. The food and service was all very average. We came here for a snack and ordered calamari and mussels, and creme brulee. The creme brulee was definitely the highlight of the meal. Price was on the steep end, which was expected. We came mostly for the atmosphere and history, but expected better food.",
