    "This small, elegant restaurant is a real winner.We couldn't read the menu, so we asked Marc Palou to recommend his best offerings. The 3 course prix fixe dinner is an excellent value for 26 \u20ac. \u00a0Chef/owner Marc Palou creates tasty, \u00a0complex dishes with very fresh ingredients, carefully seasoned. Just the right portion, too.For starters we had grilled calamari w/green salad and a mince of saut\u00e9ed vegetables. Also a delicious red pepper stuffed with wild mushrooms in a divine mushroom bechamel sauce.Mains: perfectly grilled fish in a delicate sauce.Also a flavorful rabbit stew with diced potatoes.Two desserts: fresh fruit Macedonia w/lemon sorbet; and a delicate waffle ice cream/mousse floating on a rich chocolate sauce.A respectable bottle of wine is included in the price.Our best meal in Barcelona!",
