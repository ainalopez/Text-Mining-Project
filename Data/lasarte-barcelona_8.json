    "Still eating our way through all the Michelin-starred Catalan restaurants. \u00a0We had been so disappointed the year before especially as we were staying at this hotel and were hoping they could pull a few strings for us (no luck, but had a fantastic dinner at another starred restaurant), this next visit we were able to get reservations here. \u00a0This place was great - first-class meal, good service, first-class *written* wine list (we ended up just taking the sommelier's suggestions to pair with the different courses) - another great meal in this great city.",
