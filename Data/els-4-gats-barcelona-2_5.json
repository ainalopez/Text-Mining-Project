    "In two minutes, it will be a total of ten minutes since I have asked for the check. Needless to say, I still do not have it, and this pretty much sums up the attitude of their waitstaff.The interior is gorgeous, which is why I am giving this place two stars. Marble tables, decorative walls -- it feels like dining in a giant Picasso tribute. Wonderful.Food wise, we came here for dessert and were unimpressed. There was a \"4 cat surprise box\" for 12\u20ac, and our waiter captivated us by telling us how much of a tempting surprise it will be. Of course, we decided to take it, and we were surprised with 6 miniature desserts. They were good, but not 12\u20ac good. Service wise, the waiter and waitress who interacted with us all night were quite negligent. The male waiter who lured us into buying the box was nice, but the female waitress with red curly hair was so rude to us. I am normally very patient with wait staff, but she was hard to handle! I did the 4 Cats, and I can say that I will not be returning.",
