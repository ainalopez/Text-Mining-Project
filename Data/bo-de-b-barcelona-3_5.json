    "We Visited this place twice in our short two day visit to Barcelona. It's a small shop located very close to the gothic district and the harbor. The line is usually out the door (it's a small restaurant), but it's absolutely worth it!On my first visit, I had the chicken bocadillo and steak on the second visit. The chicken was immensely more flavorful than the steak (which was still very good)! All of the veggies make the sandwich extremely light and delicious. Highly recommend coming here and getting a bocadillo with everything on it!",
