    "Went here. The person at my hotel told me I didn't need a reservation to get into this place. He was definitely wrong. I got there and was told there were no openings all day. I said I had walk 30+ minutes just to get there and she said that there still were no open table for the day. I then went and sat on the side of the restaurant to think about what to do. The hostess must have felt sorry for me and came up and told me that if I agreed to be out within 1 hour she could give me a table. I agreed. That was very nice of her.Had a salad and the Arros Negre paella. Food was very good and was it was nice to sit outside near the beach and watch the people.",
