    "Wow.. what a great meal! I would give it 5 stars but the dessert was disappointing and \u00a0rice in the paella was slightly undercooked. As for taste of the paella, it was delicious! We ordered the seafood paella and I was impressed at how ample the seafood portion was compared to the amount of rice. We also ordered the stewed monkfish with wild mushrooms and prawns... SO awesome! The fish was super fresh, perfectly tender, and so tasty. It felt like comfort food. I loved the mushrooms and the prawns too. When the server brought out the dish I was shocked at how large the portion was even though he split it into 2 plates for us to share. On top of such an excellent meal, the service was friendly and attentive. The only downside to our visit would be the dessert. My guess is we made a mistake in ordering tiramisu but they didn't have much variety other than ice cream. I would definitely come back to try more of their delicious and hearty dishes. They have a wide selection of very fresh seafood and meat dishes. I wish there was a similar restaurant in the US!",
