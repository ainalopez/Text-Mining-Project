    "A nice find in Barceloneta! I tried two of their artisanal craft beers on tap; the dark beer and the mixture of the dark and one of the lighter beers. Both were very good and well-priced at \u20ac3 for a glass. In terms of food, my friend and I only tried the croquetas, which were good and tasted homemade. I'll definitely be back for the beer and to try more of the food.The ambience of the place was nice, feeling a bit like an old-world deli or lunch counter. It got a bit loud and was definitely crowded, which makes it difficult to get from one end to the other since it's very narrow. The staff were friendly and helpful.",
