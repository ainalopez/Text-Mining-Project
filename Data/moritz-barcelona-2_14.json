    "I went to this place while spending a week in Barcelona this month. Beautiful brewery, spacious, with many options in the menu. Food was amazing as every place in Barcelona :) Beer was GREAT. \u00a0I wish I could've brought some home. Great place for meeting with friends, but very busy! Customer service in Spain sucks. \u00a0You wait for tables for a long time and staff just give you a don't care attitude at all times. \u00a0Just feel like putting this here for my fellow american friends! I was horrifies by the way they were careless but later I was informed that this is how things flow in Barcelona. Cheers!",
