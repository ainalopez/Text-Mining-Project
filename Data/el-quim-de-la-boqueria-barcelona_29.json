    "My husband and I had one of our most memorable meals from our Europe honeymoon at El Quim and our love affair with spanish tapas started here. We arrived an hour before closing and were glad we could snag seats. Ordered the razor clams, patatas bravas, and anchovies. I wish we had ordered more but this meal was our snack before our late meal. Everything was delicious and very fresh. Our server was attentive and our food came out quickly. We were in and out of there within 30 minutes but we will forever remember this meal.",
