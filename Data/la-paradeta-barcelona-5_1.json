    "This is the Best La Paradeta in the chain and definitely worth a trip to Sants. We visited the restaurant three years ago and were impressed with the quality and deliciousness \u00a0of its seafood. It defined our trip to Barcelona! So on our recent trip to Barcelona, this was an obligatory visit! We had razor clams, monkfish, and baby octopus, grilled to perfection and topped with the amazing garlic-basil infused olive oil. Then we had steamed muscles and fried baby fish (they were both tasty)! We accompanied this feast with good and reasonably priced local white wine!We will keep coming back here every time we are in town! They make such delicious seafood that becomes the stuff of dreams!(We also visited other restaurants in the chain, they were nowhere close to the care and quality of food to the restaurant in Sants!)",
