    "Excellent place for a veggie burger and milkshake in La Barceloneta. Good music, friendly staff who were really helpful when it came to allergy advice and an all round chilled out vibe. They have a range of things to eat, depending if you want a snack like a pancake or waffle or a meal. The cocktails are excellent too, best mojito I had in Barcelona. It's always busy so be prepared to wait for a table. Great place to watch the sun going down over the beach and people watch.",
