    "La Paradeta, is probably the best seafood experience I've ever had.On our first day in Barcelona, we came straight here, only to find it closed (call to check their hours). Two days later, we gave it another shot and it was open!The way it works is, you walk up to a seafood counter, pick out what you want and tell them how to cook it for you. We ended up with raw oysters, fried calamari, mussels in a tomato sauce, saut\u00e9ed baby octopus and some of the BEST cooked fish I've ever had, Monk fish.Everything was delicious, and shockingly cheap! We ordered all this food, plus a bottle of Cava for less than $58. Insane!GO HERE. Do NOT miss it.Food: 5Ambience: 3Service: 5Value: 5",
