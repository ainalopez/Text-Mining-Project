    "Once you've taken in Gaudi's Familia Sagrada, I seriously suggest stopping by this fantastic fresh seafood restaurant. \u00a0They have an incredible selection of seafood delicacies that you can have either fried or grilled. \u00a0We had the prawns and razor clams grilled, and clams cooked with a tomato sauce. \u00a0They were cooked to perfection. \u00a0We also had the salad, which included pickled orange peel which were fantastic. Everything is a la carte, including the bread and butter with garlic, but worth every penny. \u00a0We spent 48\u20ac in total including a bottle of wine.In retrospect, we wished we had ordered the two lobsters for 39\u20ac. \u00a0They looked so good.Keep in mind that this is not a traditional sit down restaurant. \u00a0You make your selections at the entrance and they call out your number when it's done. You also bus your own table, but I think all of that just added to the character.",
