    "Wandering around Mercat de la Boqueria looking for food. Specifically Fresh seafood after looking at all those seafood stalls selling all those fish, shrimps and more...As a tourist, ending up here is not really surprising! But surprisingly enough though Kiosko Universal did not feel like a tourist trap. (Maybe I can get much cheaper or better seafood somewhere but hey it was fun experience eating here!)Seafood Mix (25 Euro) and Mixed Wild Mushroom (8 Euro) were both really delicious! Ocean fresh and the flavour was light and delicate. House white was perfect choice of drink to go with the food but of course a iced cold beer maybe even be better!Sitting in the middle of Mercat de la Boqueria and eating at one of the stall was just a wonderful experience. A little touristy but still so much fun!",
