    "One of our MUST EATs while in Barcelona, now that El Bulli is closed. \u00a0The menu changes with the season so it's hard to know what's \"good' from prior reviews (though some things are there all year round, like the olives). \u00a0We let the chef/waiter choose our courses, but did make sure we put in some requests (like the olives and minibags of manchego cheese). I won't bore you with the individual items, but suffice it to say that it was an interesting experience. \u00a0Each item was definitely a vision - some things prepared and presented in a way I'd never seen before. \u00a0Taste-wise - honestly, I've had better, tastier meals.This place is definitely an experience. \u00a0Would I recommend it? \u00a0Sure - only because of Albert Adria and the overall fun, one-of-a-kind experience. \u00a0Would I go back if I returned to Barcelona? \u00a0Probably not.Note: \u00a0Try to get a reservation. \u00a0You can do this online about 2 months in advance (to the day, at midnight Barcelona time, which translated to early afternoon Los Angeles time). \u00a0Otherwise, you might get stuck in the line outside - and it's really hit or miss. \u00a0We saw poor foodies sitting out in the rain all throughout our meal, and while some did get in, the majority were still out there when we left...",
