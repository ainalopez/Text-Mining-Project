    "Best ever. There, said it. Just to catch everyone up though, since the reviews here are somewhat sparse: latest is that you must pre-pay to reserve a table. Not so surprising since it's a tiny place. Bar doesn't seat anyone until 23:30. It's very expensive. But what you get are lots of spectacular little creations, some of which are drinks, or at least, made out of what are usually drink ingredients. Staff is super friendly and laid back. No pretension at all. Wish I could eat here regularly!",
