    "This was a very disappointing experience especially after reading the reviews on trip advisor. I can sum it up by saying.......way over priced Paella, that lacked both lobster and taste. \u00a0 It was served for two and more resembled rice soup. \u00a0 The \"lobster\" shells were there with almost no meat at all. \u00a0 They did serve several mussels with the dish but that did not make up for the price. The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was busy, but we don't know why. There are other much more reasonable places to choose and I would pass on this restaurant. \u00a0 We were looking for a very good example of paella and this was not it.",
