    "Thank you Chef Greco! This is definitely one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to. Everyone was so amazing and kind to us! It was my friend's birthday and we didn't have a reservation... We were going to leave and come back another day but the chef came out of nowhere and saved the day! He insisted there was enough time to squeeze us in before a later reservation. We ordered the three option plate and another vegetarian pasta. We were also served extra sample plates of each other's meals. We had so much food on the table for the two of us that we were laughing and took pictures. All of the dishes were extremely reasonably priced and the food was amazing. The decor was interesting and eclectic and provided the perfect backdrop to our evening. We celebrated with a birthday bottle of cava that was the perfect dessert. Again, thank you to Chef Greco and the staff for making it a truly unforgettable birthday for my friend. I can't wait to bring my family the next time I am in Barcelona!",
