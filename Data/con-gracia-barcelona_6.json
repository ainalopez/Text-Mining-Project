    "Con Gracia was simply perfect.The atmosphere was minimalist yet cozy; the servers were friendly and attentive without being annoying intrusive. Helpfully, their English was great. \u00a0This was a good thing for someone whose Spanish is rusty and his Catalan non-existent.And then there was the food.I went for the Surprise Menu paired with the Surprise Wine Tasting, and I would recommend this course to everyone. \u00a0What fun is a tasting menu when you know what's coming next? \u00a0The server asks you for any food allergies, strong likes or dislikes, and soon a procession of dishes begin marching across your table. \u00a0And the wine pairings were spot-on.Go to Con Gracia, and be pleasantly surprised.",
