    "We first saw this place across from Tapeo in the Gothic district...it was packed, so went back to see what it was about. \u00a0Basically good tapas and drinks for great prices and a super fun atmosphere! \u00a0I highly recommend this place if you don't mind lots of people, standing room only and a noisy fun crowd. \u00a0 \u00a0Super nice and efficient service given how busy this place stays all the time. \u00a0Check it out...",
