    "Lots of beer, the best beer we had in Spain. \u00a0Granted, none of it was Spanish beer, but it was nice to find a place that focused on beer. \u00a0I had a very good dunkel, and it was nice of them to give me a half glass for free when the keg kicked.  I also tried a porter that was pretty good. \u00a0The beer was from all over the world. \u00a0 I liked that when you walk in you can see the storage for all the beer through the grate to the basement.",
