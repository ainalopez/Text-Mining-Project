    "Very interesting and great tasting food for a very reasonable price. The menus are printed on wine bottles, the dessert menu even on a thinner muscat-like bottle if you get to it. :-)We had a really good smoked corn soup with small mozzarella balls that tasted like it had bacon in it, a very tasty tuna carpaccio, a pizzeta (small pizza) with zucchini, heavy Brie, smoked salmon and a few greens and to top it off the dock confit with red wine sauce (a reduction, defiantly with some sort of berries in it)Now, we were two people sharing all of these, so we got to taste more. Really recommend this place. It's very small and either you have to get there just when they open at 20.30 or reserve table.",
