    "We got there when they opened for lunch and had the place to ourselves. The chef/owner talked to us about his food to explain the options, and then we got cracking on the burgers.Those burgers were some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned patties and super high quality toppings, like blackened caramelized onions and homemade tomato chutney. I was pleasantly surprised at the texture and flavor and creativity of all three burgers I had.It turns out that the chef has trained in 3 star Michelin restaurants under Paul Bocuse before. I'm not even surprised.Go get a burger here- you will not be disappointed.",
