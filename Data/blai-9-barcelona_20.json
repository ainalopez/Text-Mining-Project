    "Can't agree more with the other yelper here! I too don't understand why this place haven't gotten more review or notice on Yelp!We ran into Blai 9 accidentally after our failed attempt to Quimet & Quimet, but was 100% surprised and satisfied for the delicious and creative pintxos and drinks we got from here! All pinxtos costs 1-1.5 euro and a big jar of Sangria (the best I've had during my trip in Barcelona by the way) cost less than 10 euro I think (can't really remember the exact price but was surprisingly inexpensive)",
