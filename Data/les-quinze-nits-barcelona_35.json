    "I really loved this place and remember it fondly. \u00a0I went back in 2005 when I was visiting Barcelona. \u00a0My friends and I went for dinner and the line was out the door (everyone was waiting for it to open!) \u00a0We made it in and enjoyed a bunch of stuff off the menu. \u00a0I do remember my vegetable pasta being really good. \u00a0We also had sangria which was really yummy. \u00a0 The restaurant had two floors when we went (we were seated upstairs)...the whole place was gorgeous. \u00a0Definitely recommended.",
