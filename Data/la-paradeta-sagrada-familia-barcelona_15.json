    "Awesome! It's crowded and a little intimidating because you have to order at the seafood counter and then they cook it for you. Great seafood and a great overall experience. The razor clams were fantastic. Wine is by the bottle, but they have some very easy drinking ones. It ended up costing about 70 euro for two, but it was a serious feast!",
