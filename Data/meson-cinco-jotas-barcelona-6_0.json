    "I enjoy food and especially larger portions... With that said, the dishes were satisfying and filling only because I stuffed my face with a basket of bread at the beginning of dinner. \u00a0The food was beautifully prepared but lacking a \"Mmmmm Good\" reaction from everyone. The waitress was helpful but yet unable to make substitions or add a side of anything (vegies, rice, potatoes) to my meal.Barcelona has so many great options when it comes to food, that I would only eat here again if all other restaurants were closed.",
