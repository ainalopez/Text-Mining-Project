    "Our Airbnb host suggested La Trini, which was even within walking distance. As we reviewed the menu outside, a family exited and voluntarily gave a glowing description of their meal and the place. How could we resist? Fortunately we didn't! We had a cod dish that was served over a pumpkin puree. Delicious! We also tried a rigatoni thing with shrimp that was also wonderfully tasty. What else can one say? Cool funky neighborhood, convenient location, busy and noisy, but probably because it is deservedly popular!",
