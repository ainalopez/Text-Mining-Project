    "Had a great dinner here last night with friends. \u00a0One has been living here for a year now and this is one of his favorite restaurants in town, so we were happy to try it out. \u00a0Even though Barcelonians are calling this weather cold (it's in the 70s, even at night - that is not cold), we sat outside. \u00a0Our waitress was adorable, the malbec hit the spot, and the food was delicious. \u00a0The empanadas and provoleta were fantastic (seriously get the provoleta - it's like pizza without the carbs), and the antipasto platter is huge. \u00a0The ensalada Morelia, with duck ham, avocado and pear, was really good as well.",
