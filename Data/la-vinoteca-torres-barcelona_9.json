    "We came here randomly because we were hungry and it was the first place we saw. \u00a0The waiter was friendly. My friend ordered the chips with lemon juice. I guess he thought they would be special chips, but they seemed like just chips out of a bag with juice on them. We had the salad with apples, which was fine. The special of the day was a monkfish stew so one of my friends and i got it. It was actually a soup with a couple of pieces of fish, and some mussels and shrimp. We asked if the things in the soup had any shells or skin and the waiter said no, but that was just probably a language barrier and not his fault, since they did. The soup was awful, and the half portion was even tinier than a usual spain portion. My friend got sick from it. My other friend had a cheese pasta dish and liked his well enough, but for the amount and quality of our food, we paid 100 euro which was way overpriced for what we got. It was so gross I went home and had a sandwich. This is probably better just as a place to have wine, and not to eat.",
