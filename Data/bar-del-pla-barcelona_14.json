    "Of all the places I dined in Barcelona and Spain overall, I have to say that Bar Del Pla was probably my favorite place for tapas. There are specific times that Barcelonians eat at...so if you're trying to fit in, be prepared to wait. \u00a0If you're like me and can eat at any time all day everyday....go around 1ish-2 and avoid the hassle.  I'll cut to the chase now...the food:House Salad - one of the few places to get actual fresh greens. Filled with fresh romaine, endive, tomatoes, pomegranate,walnuts, mangoes, some other kind of nuts, splash of balsamic, and house vinaigretteCroquettes - Personally, I am a fan of squid ink so I liked this more than the chicken ones...but they are deep fried and rather dense/heavy...don't order too many pieces!Tuna Tartare - Delish, delish, delish...bits of tuna heaven toppled with arugula...delish!Potatoes Brava - standard...worth ordering if you love potatoes of any sort and/or have never tried it.Braised Veal Cheek Cannelloni - YUM! Rich, buttery, crepe like pasta stuffed with the most flavorful, soft, and tender meat. \u00a0MUST ORDER!Angry Snails - Escargots in a spicy sauce...portions are large for this dish, so after awhile, it can get overwhelmingSeared Scallops and Bacon - Exactly as it sounds...yum!There were probably about another 15 dishes that I wanted to try but if only I a bigger stomach or just more nights in Barcelona. \u00a0Everything was good...service, staff...mucho bueno. I will definitely be back when I visit BCN again.",
