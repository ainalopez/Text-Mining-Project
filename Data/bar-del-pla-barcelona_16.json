    "Just came back from trip to Barcelona and WOW this Tapas/Wine bar is phenomenal. \u00a0The atmosphere is great and the tapas options are to die for. \u00a0I had your basic Patatas Bravas and what was different from all the similar versions of this dish was how the dipping sauce was prepared. \u00a0They serve theirs with a mixture of Smoked Paprika, olive oil and a bit of tomato paste. \u00a0YUMMMMM. \u00a0The other over the top dish i had was their mushroom tapas. \u00a0This you have to get ... it was shaved paper thin slices of mushroom, purple escarole and slivers of strawberry tossed with a light vinaigrette with a touch of wasabe then it is topped with shaved parmesan cheese and finishing salt, i could have eaten four more plates of this it was so good.HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this not to mention it is in the gothic quarter.",
