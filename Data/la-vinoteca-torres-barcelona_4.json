    "This place was great because every wine is available by the glass - it's a bit more expensive that way, but you can try several different wines. \u00a0Food was quite good - most memorable was a daily special of beans with Catalan sausage - perfectly prepared and really delicious. \u00a0The salad was great too - not overly dressed with crispy tart apples and nuts.Service was polite and welcoming. \u00a0Our waiter spoke great English and recommended wines to go with the dishes we ordered.",
