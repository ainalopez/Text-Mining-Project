    "Before I went, I didn't expect too much because the place seemed too commercial and businness-like by their site. By boy, was I wrong. The pricing was really reasonable for the flavours they offered. I also got the cuttlefish fideua, cod fritters, bombeta, and fried fish (dish of the day). They were all so good!I mainly chose this restaurant because it offers the Catalan cuttlefish fideua/pasta. I am extremely happy that I did, because this dish blew me away the most while I was in Barcelona. I just couldn't get enough of this dish!! There was a good amount of ink unlike some \"ink\" paellas that I tried in Barcelona. I dream about this pan full of pasta, ink, and garlicky goodness from time to time. The next time I visit this beautiful city, I will be ordering many more plates of this amazing dish!",
