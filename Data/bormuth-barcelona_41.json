    "This tapas bar was recommended to me by my host here in Barcelona and boy was I not disapointed :)The bar is very well located, easilly accessible by foot from the old city. Its ambiance is very nice with a rustic touch with yet modern feel. The food was excellent, and with lots of choices, and a menu in both Spanish and English. We had delicious fried calamari, roasted green peper with oil and \u00a0red peper with goat cheese. Portions were sufficient and we did not need any bread on the side.The service was very friendly and efficient, with the waiter trying to help us with our choices. Prices were decent given the quality of food :)Overall a great experience and highly recommendable.",
