    "After three days of wonderful Tapas our family was seeking an alternative food choice but we were not going to resort to fast food or chain style restaurants. We wish we had found Milk sooner as the menu provided great diversity and every item ordered was extremely tasty. We had chicken wings, Asian Salad,vegetable rolls, nachos, fajitas and Vietnamese beef. Sounds like an odd collection but it all went together very well and our three young children were happy as well. A big plus!",
