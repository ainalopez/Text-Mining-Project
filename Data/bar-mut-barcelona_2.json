    "Very good tapas and interesting, fresh dishes, but quite expensive. Definitely worth it and not as touristy as other places. The value of the drinks is good, and dishes are of a high standard. What can make it expensive is the fresh seafood by the gram. Was easy enough to get a seat about 9:30 in a Thursday.",
