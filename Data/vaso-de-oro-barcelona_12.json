    "Love this place, it totally feels authentic. It sure feels like you're surrounded with locals that are catching up with each others and a few regulars that knows the waiters.We rolled in at around 11PM, grabbed a little corner table and almost immediately a server came with the menu. Ordered a few beers (their regular is blonde aka rubia, and their special is dark). I initially ordered one of each, but our waiter patiently mentioned that perhaps a dark is too strong). Delicious beer, paired really well with all the food we got:- Anchovy Canape (sandwich): delicious, I don't know how they do it. Just get it.- Olives: not too salty, i love olives!- Papatas: a bit heavy, and those mayos are just dangerous. - Salmon pan fried: pretty basic, nothing too exciting, but they are delicious.- Chorizo, fried: way way too salty, we didn't even finish it.- Foie Gras: SO delicious! They slightly pan seared it along with chopped shallots. SO good, served with toasted bread.- Roaster pepper: also very good, reminds me shishito pepperAll in all, it costed us about 50E for all the above plus 3 glasses of beer.",
