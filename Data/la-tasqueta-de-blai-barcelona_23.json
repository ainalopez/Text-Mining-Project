    "This is the best place in all of Barcelona to experience flavorful, tasty and affordable Spanish food. Honestly this was an experience I will never forget and the service was absolutely amazing to bat. This environment is a lot of fun as you will also find similar restaurants to this one in the Carrer de Blai area. If you are staying in Barcelona, this is a must visit with tapas at 1 Euro each.",
