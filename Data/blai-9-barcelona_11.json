    "We came here accidently while aiming to go to another place with a similar name. we were instantly attracted to the colorful, attractive presentation of the food. this place prices items by the bowls and not by the number of toothpicks. at the end it felt like we ate a lot of fried food in the shape of an egg roll. the mini pancakes were cute but bland. the flavors were all monotone across the pinchos. I can't remember if I liked anything particular. in the end it was pretty food but not necessarily satisfying.",
