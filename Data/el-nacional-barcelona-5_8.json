    "First off, this place is beautiful. \u00a0Who knew an old parking garage could be transformed into such a magnificent space? \u00a0Really - Wow! \u00a0Of the four restaurants housed in this cavernous food palace, we tried the Taperia. \u00a0Servers come around bearing plates of tapas - seafood, stews, potatoes, paellas... We were really hoping to get more egg dishes, but only one came around during the 90 minutes we were there. \u00a0The desserts didn't seem all that great, so we skipped it. \u00a0Do visit the bathroom so you can see the photos of before and after. \u00a0I could imagine coming here for drinks every now and again - just to soak up the atmosphere. \u00a0Though everyone seems to be taking selfies here. \u00a0that could make for a fun drinking game. \u00a0On second though, you'd be soused within 5 minutes... ok no drinking game to the selfies being taken. \u00a0perhaps I'll try one of the other restaurants. \u00a0The taperia was ok, but I wouldn't eat there again.",
