    "This amazing tapas bar was just 100m from our apartment in El Borne and the best place we had dinner. The atmosphere is very cosy and friendly. The food is the best and the staff is brilliant, friendly and quick but not in a pushing way. Will be back many times. HIGHLY recommended!!!! Six stars :)",
