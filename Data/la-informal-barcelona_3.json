    "Recommended by a local bartender, this place made my night. Great location, rustic and open inside, friendly service, and amazing burgers. The Ravalera rivaled the best burgers I've had - in the states or abroad. They've got about 15 different kinds on the menu before you start customizing with extras. While I destroyed my burger and beer, they were rockin Usher, Ne-Yo, Alicia Keys, Barry White. Felt like a club... I love this place.",
