    "This was my favorite place I went to this trip. The service was very nice but the food was what sealed the deal dude. I loved the black paella with the aioli and also the patatas were the perfect appetizer. It's a small joint so I suggest you do make reservations because the shop did fill up quick. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. This will definitely be a must go whenever I'm back in Barcelona because the food is incredible and they have the best sangria I've ever had.",
