    "I'd been meaning to go to this restaurant for awhile and am so glad I finally did! The food was incredible and the service couldn't have been better. This small restaurant has a classic, cozy feel which was perfect for lunch. Every dish we had was excellent, but the bravas, lamb, and cheese/apple/yogurt dessert were outstanding. I highly recommend Bohemic!",
