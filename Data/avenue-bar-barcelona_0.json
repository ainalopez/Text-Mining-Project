    "Amazing bar find in Barcelona. \u00a0Went to parkGuell and had some time to kill so we went to find a local place when we stumbled across this place. \u00a0This bar is so creative, fun and we had some great cocktails. \u00a0Especially the vodka, tonic with ginger and cinnamon. \u00a0 Truly a great time! \u00a0Can't leave out the fact there is Super Nintendo and word search in bathroom!",
