    "First time visitor to Barcelona. \u00a0We are staying in an apartment, so didn't have a front desk to ask for a dinner recommendation. \u00a0Turned to Yelp, found this fabulous suggestion. \u00a0The seafood paella was outstanding. \u00a0Agree that the house red wine was very good. \u00a0Casual atmosphere, English menu available. \u00a0Great service!",
