    "Absolutely delicious!We were wandering around Barri Gotico at night and found this cute little place (literally only seats about 10). Lots of people came for take-out \"para llevar\" and wandered around the streets or sat in the park across the way. We stayed in to people-watch and stare at the goodies in the glass case. We were blown away by the variety and fantastic tasting dishes. Tried a couple of things over the course of a couple days:- chorizo (so good, had it twice)- quinoa- pollo teriyaki- patatas bravas (so good!)- lentil soup- pineapple fruit shake- cake (from an outside vegan bakery)...best cake I've had in my entire life.",
