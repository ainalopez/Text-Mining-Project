    "Oy! Be prepare to spend, but it's totally worth it! \u00a0We had a $200 lunch bill which included a bottle of wine and cava,. but man that food is good! \u00a0Be sure to sit at the bar (there is a dining room, but I would just recommend it for locals or regulars). \u00a0The menu is in Catalan, making it difficult to know what you're ordering but most of the bar waiters speak english and they'll ask you what you'd like to eat more or less and pretty much customize your menu for your meal, which is fantastic! \u00a0The filet mignon was one of the best I've had in my life. \u00a0I really really love this place!",
