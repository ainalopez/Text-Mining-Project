    "I had really looked forward to try Federal's Eggs Florentine, after drooling to all the pictures here on Yelp, so I got extremely disappointed when I found out they didn't have in on the lunch menu. Maybe they only serves it in the weekend, but I was either going to try that or the avocado course, but none of them were available. Even so, there were a lot of good alternatives on the menu, and I went for Reuben, a sandwich with ham, emmentaler, fermented red cabbage, with potato chips on the side. The dish was really good, especially the emmentaler cheese was just perfect. I just wished it was a little more food on the plate, for 9 euros, I think to slices of bread and 4 potato chips is quite little food. For me, Federal would probably be a food place for some breakfast, their breakfast menu looks really good, but for lunch, the portions aren't big enough to cover for their prices, in my opinion. Then again, if the Egg Florentine had been on the menu, maybe my review would be different.",
