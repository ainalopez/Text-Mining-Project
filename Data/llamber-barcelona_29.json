    "Good looking restaurant with friendly service, but sub-par food. \u00a0Both the monkfish and the grilled vegetables were completely under seasoned with no trace of salt. \u00a0We left after two relatively overpriced and underperforming dishes. \u00a0Realizing that this restaurant caters to a British clientele might explain the lack of flavor in the food.... :-(",
