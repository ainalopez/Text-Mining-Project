    "Poor service, poor food. Didn't receive two of our items, were charged for them, and the other dishes were microwaved until luke-warm right in front of us. The food we received was greasy and under-microwaved (cold) and the customer service was weak at best. Why go here when you can get better tapas and better service for the same price two minutes away?",
