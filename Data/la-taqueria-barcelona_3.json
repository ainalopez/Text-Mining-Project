    "Some of the best Mexican food I've had in Europe! Fantastic pastor tacos, great guacamole, and really cool atmosphere!I was very lucky to walk in and get a table. It looked empty but I was told that in an hour (8:30pm) all of the tables were reserved, but I was still able to order and was served quickly and out well before then. The guacamole was smooth and delicious. I actually prefer guacamole to be chunky, but it was certainly still great, and perfect for anyone who prefers it smooth.The four 'pastor tacos' were fantastic as well. The small slice of pineapple on each taco gave it the perfect hint of sweet. They were served with two types of salsas and limes, for you to add to the tacos as you please. They also tasted great with a little guacamole added.This was some of the best Mexican food I've had in Europe, and I would definitely recommend trying it if you're in the are and looking for something like this!",
