    "This is such a gem. \u00a0As a first-timer, it was a bit overwhelming...but once you figure it out, it's amazing! \u00a0I love that there are different distinct restaurants within the building. \u00a0We chose the tapas one. \u00a0I LOVE the concept! \u00a0You pick our cold tapas - then you wait for the hot ones! \u00a0Every few minutes a waiter will come out from the kitchen with a tray of a specific hot dish. \u00a0They yell out which one it is - and if you want it - you raise your hand and claim one! \u00a0Each tray has anywhere from 1 -5 dishes on it, so you have to be fast if it's something you like! \u00a0It was tough, as we don't speak Catalan and had no idea what anything was - BUT, I'll eat anything, so it was a great way to try new foods. \u00a0Prices were very reasonable. \u00a0Only complaint - their sangria is a bottled version. \u00a0Not home made. \u00a0I will definately go back when in Barca!",
