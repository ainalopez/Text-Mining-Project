    "Said to be one of the best local tortilla espanola (Spanish omelette) places in the Gotic area. Two kinds of tortilla made daily. We opted for the potato onion version. Thin slices of potato studded with sweet onion, perfect breakfast. Sit at the counter and if you're up for it, order a glass of the casa de vermut (house vermouth) to go with your traditional Catalan breakfast.",
