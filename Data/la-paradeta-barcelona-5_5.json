    "My favorite restaurant in Barcelona. My friends and I have tried almost all the seafood there, although we stayed away from lobster and crab. My favorite dish was the razor clams but almost everything there was good. The rape fish soup was delicious and flavorful. Best of all the place was very cheap. About $13 for each person for our fill on fresh seafood.",
