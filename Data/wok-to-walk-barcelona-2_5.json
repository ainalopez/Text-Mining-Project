    "This place is so bueno! I'm glad they're plentiful and easy to find. It's also open super late if you're hungry after all those tapas - 3am. There's a good variety of noodles & rice, as well as vegetables. I've only tried 1 so far - udon with beef & broccoli with Saigon (black pepper & garlic sauce). It's a solid combo! A bit on the salty side but so satisfying after eating so many days of Basque & Catalan food. I'd get this if it was in the US too!",
