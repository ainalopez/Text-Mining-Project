    "Sangria was my water in Barcelona. Seriously. I drank at least a pitcher of sangria every day...well shared a pitcher, those were good days. But, some days we did 2 pitchers a day. Those were great days.So after an amazing dinner up the street, we ended up here for dessert. Dessert in liquid form. Sweet, sweet dessert. Ok, it was wine with sugar. But it was the best kind of dessert you could ask for and at \u20ac10 for a liter, I call that a deal. The sangria was solid. The pitcher came with two small glasses, and we posted up by the window at a little table/bar setup. Smooth, sweet and stacked with chunks of fresh fruits. Getting a seat by the window offered up some awesome people watching while we sipped away. The staff was super friendly a and the bites looked really good, but we were stuffed.",
