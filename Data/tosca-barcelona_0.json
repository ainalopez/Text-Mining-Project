    "Tapas were fantastic! We had the foie gras with brie, potatoes with curry onion mayo, veggie lasagna, Swedish meatballs, chef's salad, and mojito. The menu has so many options that it was difficult to decide, but in the end we loved everything that we ordered! Every dish was perfect - all the dishes felt familiar and sounded average on the menu, but when they came out each one had a unique twist. The foie came with a raspberry jam, the meatballs came with an almond sauce (so good!) and the chef's salad had a sweet balsamic dressing. The wait staff was friendly albeit a tad slow. Nonetheless our server took her time walking us through the menu, and everyone tolerated our awful Spanish. They all spoke English thankfully which we appreciated. All in all, we loved this restaurant. It was one of our favorite meals in Barcelona. This is a very touristy neighborhood and many other patrons at Tosca spoke English/not Spanish, so we felt at home. They take credit card and tapas can be ordered up until 12am. We will be back!",
