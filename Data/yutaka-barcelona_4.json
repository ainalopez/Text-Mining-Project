    "Five stars for the quality of food for the cost. Lunch and dinner on weekends is \u20ac15. I think dinner on weekdays is also \u20ac15 and weekday lunch is \u20ac10. Drinks not included. The spread is a good variety and it tastes pretty good. How good? If the the cost was more than \u20ac25 I would rethink on eating here (but then again, I'm a recent transplant from California where you can get awesome food from a mom and pop place for cheap). There are some nigiri and rolls (only had one piece... Always hesitate eating sushi and buffets). They also have a guy that will cook veggies and meat for you - it's like a quasi Mongolian BBQ. Options to get cooked: shrimp/prawns, squid, chicken skewers, some cuts of beef, sausage, assortment of veggies. There also a selection of your stereotypical Chinese food (think chow mein and deep fried things), 2-3 dim sum items, fruit and baked goods for dessert and ice cream. The ice cream was good. Get a scoop (it's ice cream, not soft serve!). If you are really hungry and are craving some Asian food, come here. Also, u can ask for hot sauce and they will give you a dish of it (looks like sriracha).",
