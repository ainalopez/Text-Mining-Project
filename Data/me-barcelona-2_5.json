    "Colleagues and I went to Me in Barcelona during a conference. This place mixes vietnamese, cajun and spanish food at a 5 star level. It sounds strange, but the way they put it together is really top class. The food was fresh and the tastes were distinct. For starters we had a selection of spring rolls, ravioli, southern fried chicken and vermicelli. I don't think I have ever eaten chicken that good before and the mix of tastes kept it interesting. Because we were a large group, we got a set menu with a choice of three main dishes. I had the sea bass and it was spectacular. I would highly recommend this place if you are in Barcelona.",
