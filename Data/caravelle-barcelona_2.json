    "I'm normally not a big brunch guy, but my fiancee loves the stuff. \u00a0She rolled her eyes with delight at her guyere baked eggs (with leeks, cream, lemon zest, spinach and toast - 8.50 \u20ac).I had the french toast (9.50 \u20ac). \u00a0It was fine, but I've had french toast before.We also sampled the coconut bread (4.50 \u20ac) and it was pretty good.Our server was very nice. \u00a0She spoke with an English accent, which I didn't expect in Spain.The venue itself is typical brunch chic. \u00a0Pastel colors, reclaimed wood, chalkboards, that kind of thing. \u00a0They do have wi-fi, so it's a comfortable place to crash if you want to get away from Las Ramblas for a while.I wish we could have come back for lunch or dinner since I read great things about their tacos and burgers.",
