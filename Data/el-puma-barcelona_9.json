    "Double WoW !! I have to agree with my fellow Yelpe, MAEQUS R, this a one great place to start feasting. There is fish, meat , and chicken. Everything is fresh and the dessert buffet is great save room for the coconut flan. They have two types of paella, rice and one I never had a fine noodle one. Both were great. They will make you a grilled made to ordered steak on their grill. Its located off the main track but very easy and very safe to get to. The prices are great too. If you come during the week the price was only 13 euros. I went their twice with yelper Marqus and he enjoyed it as much as I did. The staff was very friendly and took away our dirty dishes as fast as we could empty them. do make the trip to this great place and then have a nice walk , its Thanksgiving Dinner Barcelona. Note** Don't say you are in Spain , I was corrected 4 times for saying Barcelona, Spain. Where I was in the restaurant and the city were great",
