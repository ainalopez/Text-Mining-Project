    "If you are craving for meat but on a budget, this is the place to go.1 steak with fries & beer is about \u20ac10, and the portion is generous.Might not be the best steak, but its more than ok for the price.I dont know if the waiters speak english or not, but it wont be a problem because in the menu card it explains the part of the meat.1 think I noticed, the waiter will not ask how do you like your steak, so mine were well done",
