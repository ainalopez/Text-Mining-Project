    "Walked in for lunch and had a great experience. Sat outside on their well appointed patio, and had very attentive service. The Sangria was delicious, and not overly sweet like many you find out there. Their tapas were all made to perfection. The patatas bravas had a light swirl of the brava sauces which was a great departure from the slathering on of sauce many places do. The whole fried fish were light, crispy, and amazing, the shrimp were simply cooked perfectly and seasoned with some coarse salt, and the manchego and Iberico plates had enough for two. Great food, very fair pricing, and great ambiance.",
