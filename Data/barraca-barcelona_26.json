    "The place is good but the paella was not to the liking of my American palate. \u00a0The prawns saut\u00e9ed in garlic were excellent. \u00a0Service was good. \u00a0Ambiance is excellent. \u00a0It's a bit pricey. \u00a0The problem I have with the paella is its blackened in the oven and the fish and rice are flavorless. \u00a0You cannot taste any subtleties. \u00a0Since this place was recommended by the ny times specifically for paella, \u00a0I was disappointed.",
