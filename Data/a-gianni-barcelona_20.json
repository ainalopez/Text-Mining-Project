    "Love it and more please...We decided to visit A Gianni for two reasons: very close to our hotel & to deviate from Spanish tapas. \u00a0I am so glad we did because we had a great dinner with excellent service.I enjoyed everything from the wine recommendation by Angelica, the design of the restaurant and the food! \u00a0We were not disappointed with any dish that we ordered. \u00a0And that includes our second visit.We love our wine so we ask for bottles with certain characteristics. \u00a0Angelica listened to what we like and was spot on with her recommendations. \u00a0An extra bonus was that the wine was served in a proper wine glass at the correct temperature.Now for the food...I don't know how such simple dishes can be sooooo good. \u00a0Our first visit there we started with a caprese salad. \u00a0It is large enough to split (see my picture) so save some space for other dishes. \u00a0I thought I was eating bufala mozzarella made that very day. \u00a0After the salad I had a great and simple steak. \u00a0It was season and cooked how I would cook my own steak. \u00a0My wife ordered a pizza from their menu. \u00a0Again the size was generous. \u00a0After I ate a slice I wanted to come back to try more of their dishes.Our second dinner. \u00a0I know it may sound weird that we ate here two times out of the five nights we stayed. \u00a0But our flight the next day was at 6:30am and we had to be packed and ready early the night before. \u00a0So we came back because we knew the food will be good. \u00a0We shared another starter, prosciutto with mozzarella. \u00a0I would recommend this dish over the caprese if you had to choose between the two. \u00a0Then we split an order of risotto and a pizza. \u00a0BEST RISOTTO EVER! \u00a0I couldn't believe how great it tasted. \u00a0And again it was no more than four or five ingredients. \u00a0We ordered the risotto special of the day, chicken risotto with lemon. \u00a0It was perfectly cooked, not over cooked or too al dente. \u00a0And it tasted amazing, just a hint of lemon to pair with the chicken and risotto. \u00a0 \u00a0I know we will be returning to A Gianni when we come back to Barcelona.",
