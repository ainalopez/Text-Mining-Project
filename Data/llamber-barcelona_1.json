    "This is an excellent place for breakfast after a tough night out on the town.Located next to El Born CC, the only thing it has against it in the morning is that it's in the shade, so it's not as nice as it could be if it was 100m away!Don't let that stop you from going there though. Half the time Barcelona is so hot you actually want to be in the shade so it's not such a bad thing.The coffee is fairly decent (though nowhere near as good as Nomad). The food is very tasty and the service is really friendly, if a little slow (this is quite normal in Barcelona as the pace of life is considerably slower in Spain than in many other countries.I'll definitely go back here next time I am in Barcelona :)",
