    "Amazing food- you order the seafood at the beginning and they tell you how they can cook it - get a salad - they are great and go for the shellfish - mussels are cheap and the clams are also great - order a vBottle of white , or two bottles, wine is well priced - get the little octopuses and get them fried - o, and when you order, they give you a number - and a receipt - hold onto the receipt, they cross items off as they are ready - bus your plates and glasses to the second window - wine comes with an ice bucket - keeps it chilled - great price and great food",
