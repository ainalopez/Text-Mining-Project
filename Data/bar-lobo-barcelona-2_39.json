    "I love Bar Lobo! Highly recommended for tourists who want good quality food, reasonable prices and good service. The servers are friendly, the location is very good. I live in the neighborhood and visit Bar Lobo regularly. I host a lot of guests and Bar Lobo is a must for each visitor - every one of my guests has enjoyed their meals. Personally I recommend the fried eggplant (noteworthy because I'm not usually a fan of eggplant - but this is the best!), chicken wings, any of the green salads, tuna, salmon & boquerones. But honestly, you can't go wrong by ordering any of the small plates & sharing.",
