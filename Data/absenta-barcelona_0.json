    "This is where I park my butt a few nights a week. \u00a0The service is typical as is the wine, but the atmosphere is just lovely and lovely in only a NYC transplant can love. \u00a0It's hipster--and when you're not around hipsters all the time you miss it.Not only does it have comfortable couches, but one can get actual absinth served properly there. \u00a0I do recommend trying the absinth at least once, but my current alcohol tolerance left it for a experience--headache in the morning--however I consistently go back because I love the homemade art and eclectic music they play.If any of this sounds appealing then you will like the clientele as well. \u00a0It's a great place to have a random chat with arty types from all over Spain and France.",
