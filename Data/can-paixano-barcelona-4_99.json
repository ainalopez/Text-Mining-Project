    "Have your expectations in line and you'll love this. 1) you will be crammed in here 2) you will feel overwhelmed at first and intimidated while ordering 3) seems questionably unhygienic.... \u00a0However, if you're young and don't care: the food was inexpensive and amazing. For 12\u20ac Carissa and I got a bottle of Rose Cava and two large tapa plates which was enough to make us both full and a bit tipsy. We suggest plate variete (3.90\u20ac) and croquettes (3.00\u20ac)",
