    "I really enjoyed Bier CaB. I had several beers here and the Bier CaB patates and the Petico sandwich (Waygu beef and peppers). Both were delicious.I spent a lot of time here just because it was fun watching the people. Manolo, one of the owners and bartender, was fun to watch as he greeted people and directed the other staff and patrons throughout the evening.Worth the visit if you like beer and definitely worth visiting if you enjoy beer and a great atmosphere!",
