    "I had an awesome experience here! Everything is delicious and waiters keep walking by each table to yell out names of the food they are holding in their trays and made it a really fun experience. The razor clams were so good and I had to get two plates. Only downside is the bill added up quickly. It was a very expensive lunch but no regrets.",
