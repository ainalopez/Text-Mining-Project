    "It's such a struggle being away from mexican food when it's so accessible in California. However, Rosa Negra does an excellent job of filling in that gap. Mojitos for \u20ac3.50 and shrimp burritos were so good. My friend got the chicken mole and the chocolate sauce it came with was surprisingly so good with the dish. I love how the place is decorated and being seated on the second floor gives you a nice view of the entire restaurant.",
