    "Foie gras burger was hands down the BEST lunch near the Picasso Museum. Perfectly cooked resting on top of sea salted potato in a delicious olive oil. Heaven. \u00a0The olive oil they use is magical pixie dust. Service was slow at first, but once they submit the order via wireless device, food comes out like the Jetson's cartoon. Our server brought out complimentary patatas bravas without the mayo aioli for the kids. Bravo for the bravas !! Extensive wine list and menu \"del dia\" included, appetizer, entree, & dessert for 9.95 Euro. Completely worth it. Outdoor seating is the usual + 15%, but if you sit inside you will enjoy the modern lighting and decorative varnished wooden repurposed wine crates.",
