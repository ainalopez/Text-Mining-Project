    "At first you'll want to leave. Absolutely no room. People bumping into you, spilling their cava, shouting in a drunken stupor all the while you're trying to order and can't get the guy's attention. Be patient, be aggressive. You have to fight for your meal here but it's part of the whole experience. Instead of ordering what sounded good, I ordered what looked good. Just look around at the plates coming out & point to say, \u00a0\"Una plata.\" This system worked incredibly well for me. Rosada cava will cost you \u20ac1/glass. You can't buy it by the bottle after 5 pm. I think it's their way of keeping track of how much you've had and when to cut you off. A security guard at the door will let you know when there's \"room\" for you to enter.",
