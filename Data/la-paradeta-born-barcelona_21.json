    "Fresh seafood, big portions, not expensive. Took fried calamari (andalou style), gambas, and marinated mussels. The preparation of mussels was very good, I loved it! With the wine, it went to about 35\u20ac for 2 people. The atmosphere is simple and relax: you go grab your food yourself. The place is quite noisy though. But I keep an excellant memory of this diner!",
