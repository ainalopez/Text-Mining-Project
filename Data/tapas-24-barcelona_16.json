    "Good food, cozy atmosphere, long wait if want to sit outdoors. The restaurant is set in a basement of a building and the line goes all the way against the wall up the stairs and out the door. Even though they have long wait, they do not rush the clientele out and you can have a relaxing meal.We tried the Mac Foie Gras, Bikini ham/cheese, Croquettes and the chocolate Gelato with sea salt and olive oil. All was tasty, the chocolate gelato is an acquired taste as the combination of the salt/olive oil with chocolate was not what we cared for.Great experience for a lunch off the busy Av. Diagonal.",
