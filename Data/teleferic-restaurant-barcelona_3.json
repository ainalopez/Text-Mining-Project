    "My husband and I went here while on our honeymoon. The staff was so nice and helpful. They recommended their favorites and joked with us. The food is amazing. There are so many things to try. We loved it so much we came back a day later. They even remembered us and gave us free champagne. Any time we come to Barcelona, this will for sure be where we eat!",
