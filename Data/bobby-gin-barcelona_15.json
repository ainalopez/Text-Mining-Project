    "If you like gin, then this is a must visit place! Wonderful gin bar with hundreds of different gin available! To say Spaniards have sweet tooth is an understatement, so even their G&T is on the sweetside, for those who is not so much into sweetness try the gin fonk instead of G&T, same refreshingness but with hint of acidity",
