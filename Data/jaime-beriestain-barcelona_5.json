    "If the thought of eating in the middle of an interior design studio/high-end housewares and floral shop gives you pause then this place is not for you. \u00a0If not, join the interior decorator set at this very solid venue. \u00a0The service was fantastic and the food very good. \u00a0The innovative continental menu provided a great respite from all the surrounding tapas and Italian establishments. \u00a0You might even find yourself leaving with fresh flowers or some new dishes. \u00a0But, then again, I guess that is the point of this so-termed Concept Store and Restaurant.",
