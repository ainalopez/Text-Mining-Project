    "i love this place. \u00a0a couple of my friends had been here before and insisted that we all go together. \u00a0they knew what they were doing, so i just followed along. \u00a0find a spot at the bar, order a round of cava and some nibbles. \u00a0i believe you have to order some food w/ each round of drinks. \u00a0nibbles come in 3 food groups: \u00a0carbs (bread), meat (in all shapes and forms), and dairy (cheese). \u00a0we ordered up on a bunch of jamon, cheese, sausage, and bocadillos. \u00a0in about 2 hours, 5 of us only racked up a bill of 56 euros. \u00a0amazing!!!it gets super packed, but it makes for a great time!",
