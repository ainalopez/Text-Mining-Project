    "I can't believe I went to Barcelona and of all the things I could've had...drinking chocolate, coffee, and orxata/horchata...I had a craving for milk tea? What?But really though, sometimes you know who you and you know what you want and this was some legit milk tea in Barcelona with all the fixins that you'd expect from a respectable bubble tea shop anywhere in the world.The highlight was having your choice of OG tapioca bubbles/pudding and then a wide array of the fruit-bursting bubbles in flavors I'd never encountered before such as blueberry. Yelp check-in gives you a free add-in, so that's a plus too.",
