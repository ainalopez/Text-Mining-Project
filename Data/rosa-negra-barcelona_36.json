    "A friend of mine told me that I had to go to Rosa Negra when I visit Barcelona. When I got there I understood why. The place is really charming, nicely decorated and has a lovely atmosphere. We started by ordering their famous Mojito (3.50 \u20ac!!!), it was delicious and beyond pricey! We ordered nachos with guacamole and it was the best guacamole I've ever had!!! When it was time for the main dish I had to try their famous burritos and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! The story doesn't end here. Even though we were stuffed we couldn't leave Rosa Negra without trying their chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream. We did not regret it. So please please please, promise me you'll visit Rosa Negra if you visist Barcelona!",
