    "This is a lovely wee place that should be getting 4 or 5 stars, but has a couple of major flaws that bring its ranking down.First the good. The location is great, just off the born area and it happened to be right opposite my hotel. The decor is good inside and tables at the big open doors are amazing for sitting at and watching the world go by. \u00a0The brunches taste excellent, especially the egg dishes. Omelettes , scrabbled eggs, toast and eggs, etc, all cooked well and spot on flavour-wise. Dinner gives you a selection of great tapas. I particularly liked the pumpkin ravioli, but e everything we had was tasty. The place is open from first thing In the morning to late at night and is always busy with a good atmosphere. Plenty of cool drink options and homemade desserts are available!The flaws. The slowest service I have experienced in a long time. Get more staff!The tiniest portions in Barcelona. Make sure you order extra or you will be hungry. 3 stars I am afraid, but it is lovely and if they could fix the last two issues it would be amazing.",
