    "One of the few places in Barcelona I've shamelessly referred to as both \"charming\" and \"wonderful.\" \u00a0With a muted, narrow fa\u00e7ade, Timeline is easy to miss; however, a clock hanging outside the door gives it away. \u00a0Inside, the lighting is dim and the decor tasteful -- a NOLA-inspired \"old clock/random brass object\" theme, if that makes sense. \u00a0Not a ton of seating but its size is perfect for conversation and drinking casually; lots of mature local hipster-y types.Ordered bacon-wrapped dates with brie, pan con tomate, croquetes and......something else. \u00a0It was all excellent and relatively cheap. \u00a0The cocktails were AWESOME, and the menu listed a bunch of (good) specials for each day of the week. \u00a0Asked for a whisky sour, and even though the (very friendly) barkeep didn't know how to make it, he gave it a college try and it ended up being one of the best I've ever had. \u00a0Let's just say I'll be going back for Sunday brunch and bottomless mimosas!Oh, and they have Jenga.",
