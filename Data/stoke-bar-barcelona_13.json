    "Stoke Bar is an expat bar located in the heart of the Barr\u00ed Gotic, close to Las Ramblas and Pla\u00e7a Jaume in Barcelona. It was formely owned by a well known travel company in Barcelona - ''Stoke Travel'. Whilst being an expat bar, this bar still gets many locals and generally has a really good atmosphere. Having lived in Barcelona for the past 6 months, I come to Stoke every once in a while and the owners there are always happy to see their regulars and treat you more like a friend than a customer. This is a really great bar for meeting new people from all over the world and I've spent many a night here chatting to people. Food is really good here and reasonably priced. I recommend the nachos! If you're after authentic Spanish food then this isn't the place to come, although they do have local things such as pan amb tomate (tomato bread) and some other tapas. As an average a ca\u00f1a (what us Brits would call a half pint) are about \u20ac2.20 and a pinta (pint) is about \u20ac4/5 which is normal for bars in the centre of Barcelona.Overall, a bar that everyone should come to, particularly expats studying or living here if they want some good company and a reminder of home!",
