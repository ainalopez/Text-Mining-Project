    "It's not often I've encountered food so good that I would fly back just to eat there. This is that place.Specifically, their sirloin with foie gras (solomillo con foie) is the best steak I've ever had in my life. HOLY CRAP. This fall-apart juicy sirloin is grilled with bits of charred onion to add caramelized goodness.The atmosphere is the second-best part. It's narrow, crowded with only bar stools to sit on - all facing a spoon-and-knife clanging squad of older Spanish men cooking up a storm. It's truly an experience in local Catalan life. The staff all yell orders to each other and the patrons are local old men, which changes to tourists later in the night. It's no-frills amazing food. Cooks can speak English only based on what is on the menu, but the menu is in both English and Spanish. Watching them cook is a spectacle within itself, and you'll find comfort in the noise and bustle of a true Catalan gem.I would travel back just to come here. Amazing.",
