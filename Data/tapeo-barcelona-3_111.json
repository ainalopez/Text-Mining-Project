    "A friend suggested Xampanyet for dinner, but said that if it's too busy, I should just go across the street to Tapeo. So glad I did. For 44 Euros, two of us got half a pitcher of cava sangria, four delicious plates, and a bread pudding that I could eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The best, most affordable meal I've had in Barcelona. Get the pork ribs--sweet and salty and tender--and the patatas bravas, which were less oily and more flavorful than others I've had in the city. If there are two of you, ask for seats above the kitchen where you can watch the cooks chop squid and torch custard in a space the size of most people's closets. Still marveling at how they made the truffled eggs with foie gras and mushrooms.",
