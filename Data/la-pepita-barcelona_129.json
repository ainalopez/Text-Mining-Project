    "Eight of us went and the waitress never saw so much food go to one table. \u00a0Good service, fast and friendly staff. \u00a0We basically had everything on the menu. \u00a0The only thing I had a problem with was this goat cheese plate. \u00a0Too strong for my taste. \u00a0Seafood was fresh, except for the canned food.. \u00a0Ie mussels in a can. \u00a0Interesting for sure, but very good.",
