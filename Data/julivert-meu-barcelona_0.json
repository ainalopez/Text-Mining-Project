    "Just off Rambles but as authentic as it comes. This little restaurant is steps from the tourists but seems like I stepped into a village outside Barcelona. Try the manchego cheese to start and the sausage for dinner and the truffle chocolates for dessert. We loved this place and came back another time. Yum!",
