    "The food was so amazing here! Beautifully made and so thought out. We were so impressed. Like other reviews mentioned, Tapas with a Twist. Definitely one of our favorite dining experience in Barcelona. There are single tables and one large communal table. We spent around 100 dollars for a meal for two which we thought was well worth the money. The service is on point. We added an order and they changed the order of our food to make sure we got the best experience.",
