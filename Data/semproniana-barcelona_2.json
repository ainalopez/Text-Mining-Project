    "Great place. There was a list of around 10-15 dishes only. The food came in a set of sizes, small, medium and large. We ordered 7 different small or medium dishes, which was enough for my girlfriend and I. The food was really amazing though. Everything we had we wanted more of. The tasting style menu was a great way to navigate through the many different dishes and ensured you got to try everything you wanted. It doesn't look like it is busy from the street, but most of the tables are in the back room.Definitely recommend going if you can.",
