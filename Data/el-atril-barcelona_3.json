    "Pretty cute and cozy tapas place. It was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and feel like we could relax and take our time eating. We sat outside and our server brought us over some menus. We ordered drinks and she took care of us pretty speedily. I started with some sliced meat and a cheese plate. The cheese was very good and some of the best I had while in Spain. For my meal, I ordered the butifarra sausage which was very tasty. It was hot and sliced, and wasn't too salty. Sometimes sausage can be incredibly too salty so this was very welcome for me!My sister got the guacamole and chips and the guacamole was VERY fresh. I'm not even a huge guacamole fan and I actually liked it here. The prices were reasonable but it took or server a long time to bring us our check. She sort of disappeared for a while and then we finally found her and were on our way. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for simple but delicious tapas.",
