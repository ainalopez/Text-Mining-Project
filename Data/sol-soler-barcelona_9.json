    "I love this place. It's located by the plaza and if you're lucky, get an outside seating. Note that service is not the fastest so do not come here if you're in a rush. If you want to enjoy, this is the place. All their food is amazing. I recommend the chicken wings and patatas bravas. Everything is very reasonably priced and I always bring friends here.",
