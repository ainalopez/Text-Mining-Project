    "You get to know about this place at the Picasso museum, as it was the favourite hangout of Picasso and his friends. The restaurant is well kept, nice atmosphere , food is good but not excellent, bill is quite high although we expected it. Service was good, there was also a piano player that night which we thought it was nice.",
