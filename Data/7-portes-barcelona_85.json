    "Some pretty good authentic dishes here and great atmosphere plus location. But definitely very touristy \u00a0the menu itself is in like 8 different languages.The paella comes in a pretty big portion \u00a0definitely enough for two to share. And very tasty. The Monkfish stew was also pretty good \u00a0although it took forever to arrive.Overall, if you're looking for a refined dining experience and in the area, then its not a bad bet. But its pricey, and the food isn't mind-blowing. But I guess tourists can't be picky!",
