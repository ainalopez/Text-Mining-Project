    "My husband and I came across The Benedict our first night in Barcelona wandering the streets. We didn't know what to expect but were pleasantly surprised with the eclectic style and busy atmosphere. We picked a spot up at the bar and were immediately waited on by the bartender who explained the drink specials for the night. We settled on Sangria and a Gin Tonic. The drinks were gigantic! After a cocktail we settled on a meat and cheese plate that took a little longer than expected to come out from the kitchen. The food and presentation was well worth the wait. We ended up coming back to the bar a few more times during our trip to have a drink while we were sight seeing. I recommend at least stopping in to see the decor of the place and having a drink while you are looking around Barcelona!For more information and pictures check out our site : thegreatcubeescape.com",
