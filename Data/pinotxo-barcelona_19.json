    "This place is out of this world! If I had to pick two places to visit in Barcelona, this will be one of it (very hard choice between Pinotxo & Tickets). Tucked in the front of the busiest most touristy market in Barcelona, Mercat Bocqueria. Look no further, it's right by the fruit stall in the front row. If you see a huge wait, that's it. Get a cava or beer while you wait, be patient, the wait is totally worth it.Catch the eye of the servers, or the world famous Juanito; and they'll keep a mental list of when you get to sit. Just a tip, don't wait behind locals. Wait behind tourists with huge cameras and iphones/andriods out on the table. Locals might stay here forever..What to get? Trust the opinion of Juanito. He's the guru. Everything is tasty, although I have a bias for the seafood dishes that come with some kind of sauce.Gamba/prawns - very big prawns. served with salt and olive oil. very freshlobster/Logastino - served with olive oil and salt. fresh and tastyClams - served with salt and olive oil. fresh and deliciousRazor clams - served with salt and olive oil. out of this world! MUST GET! sweet sweet clamsChick peas - this is the only place in the world where I would crave for the chick peas. so delicious! Squid and beans - comes with balsamic sauce. so fresh, the vinegar brings out the flavor of the squid. so good!!! chocolate cake/dessert - goodMany locals just come for the cortado (milk and espresso), looks really tasty, and is prepared by Juanito. Also, if you come before 10:30am, there's no wait at all! And you get anything and everything you want! Love it. most locals only get croissants though, but forget that, and get the seafood. You'll love it.",
