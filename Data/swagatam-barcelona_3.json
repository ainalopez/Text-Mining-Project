    "I absolutely loved this place. It doesn't look like much from the outside or the inside. But the staff was lovely and they asked us if it was our first time there and tried to help us order what would suit us best. The food was incredible. Honestly my favorite indian food ever and i love indian food. I can't wait to come back.",
