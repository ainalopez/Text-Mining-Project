    "First stop Espa\u00f1a!Montadito paradiseAuthentic? Prob not...Do you want to try everything that Spain has to offer in the form of a tiny sandwich?Do you want super cheap booze in a giant mug of happiness?Do you want loud music and mediocre atmosphere?Are you looking to pre-game... or post game?Cien Montaditos is where you can find all this and more. Pretty much ever Spanish tapas/food combination on a tiny hot dog sized baguette. Actually, the hot dog is pretty good. Honestly, my favorites here are the basics: jamon, the one with pesto, and tortilla. You'll get full and drunk very quickly and cheaply. \u00a0De nada.",
