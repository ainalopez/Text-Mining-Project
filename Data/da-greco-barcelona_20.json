    "We ate at Da Greco last night. We found it through Yelp and our concierge. We found it to be a pleasant restaurant close to our hotel. The service was not exceptional and spotty at times. Unfortunately, our orders were reversed and we were served our main dishes prior to our starters. Despite that the meal was pretty good. We ordered the three cheese pasta, a mozzarella salad and the veal mignon. They mistakenly served us the salad and veal first instead of in reverse. Both were very good. The veal mignon was huge and cooked to perfection. When we finished and quite full they brought out the pastas. We thought it would be three on a plate and we would share it. What turned out was three full plates of pasta each one better than the other. They served a ravioli filled with mushroom, linguini ala vongole, and gnocchi in a tomato cheese sauce. Needless to say we were stuffed. Despite the shoddy service it's a nice place to enjoy Italian food in Barcelona. The chefs son who's from New York is the pastry chef. If you're in the mood for Italian in Catalonian country it's worth the trip.",
