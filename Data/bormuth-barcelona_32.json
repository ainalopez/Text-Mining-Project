    "Yum! So much was closed in Barcelona when we were there, but Bormuth was open, and we're lucky it was! It was one of our best meals -- probably my favorite -- of the trip. Cool atmosphere, too, but it was hot inside. Also worthwhile to note this was one of three places from our entire Barcelona experience where the service was friendly!We ordered:-White anchovies in vinegar-Pan con tomate-Mini tourpedo with foie and onions-Steak tartareWould recommend all, especially the mini tourpedo.",
