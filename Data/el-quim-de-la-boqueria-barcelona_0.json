    "We came here twice on our last visit to Barcelona... El Quim is irresistible! We loved everything we tried and some of our favorite items include the Razor Clams, the Potatoes with special sauce, and the Ham. My mouth waters just revisiting the tastes as I write this review and post the pictures. Also, the owner we met was so friendly & he recognized that we had come back twice, which always adds to the restaurant experience. Tip: Check out Nextflix's show \"I'll Have What Phil's Having\" from the food aficionado & writer of \"Everyone Loves Raymond\" to see his visit to El Quim for brunch! Tip: Leave yourself extra time to stroll the market & enjoy its atmosphere.",
