    "We were looking for a tapas place that was open on a Sunday and walked by this place in El Born. It looked like the kind of vibe we were looking for and we took our seats on the balcony overlooking the restaurant and street below. We shared 7 dishes, all of which were delicious. They did come out at lightning speed so I would suggest staggering your order. The huevos estrellados con chorizo and papas with mojo were standouts. Watching the world go by with a few tinto de veranos and ca\u00f1as accompanying our food was the best way to spend our last evening in Barcelona. The staff were very friendly and the price was reasonable- just under 50 euros for what seemed like a royal spread of tapas. An adorable place with friendly service and yummy food in the old city. What is there not to enjoy? I look forward to my return to Bormuth.",
