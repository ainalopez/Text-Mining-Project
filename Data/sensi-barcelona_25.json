    "This is 5 star food but the service is extremely slow when waiting to get seated, even with a reservation, which is why I've reduced it down to 4 star. Do not come if you're in a rush, you'll be there for at least two hours for dinner. The vibe is great for drinks and groups, it's pretty loud in the restaurant. You must order two tapas per person, so I recommend sharing everything!",
