    "No kidding. \u00a0The meal I had here was one of the best I've had (I won't speak for my husband). \u00a0We showed up early (by Spanish standards) and they seated us, but said they had a reservation for our table in 2 hours. \u00a0Then they did not rush us at all. \u00a0Delicious wine and really delicious tapas. \u00a0Let's see... we had squid gratin, crunchy tomato toast, the special pork shoulder, one or two others, but the best was the salmon carpaccio. \u00a0It may have been the tastiest thing I've ever eaten in my life. \u00a0Our waiter was quite wonderful and charming. \u00a0Cozy restaurant. \u00a0I hope you'll enjoy it as much as we did!",
