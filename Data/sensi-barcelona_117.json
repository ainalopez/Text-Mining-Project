    "TRAVELERS BEWARE!!! Bill padding! \u00a0As a neighbor of this restaurant I was utterly appalled by this place. \u00a0It seems to be busy every night when I walk past it on my way home so when I had a friend visiting from the states. I thought we'd give it a shot. \u00a0The food was mediocre at best. We had the 1/2 order of truffle ravioli, which was very al dente, and a few other tapas which were just ho hum. \u00a0When they brought the bill they had charged us for a full order of ravioli, and extra order of batatas bravas and bread that we didn't touch. I will not be back.",
