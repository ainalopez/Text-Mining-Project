    "We tried Tosca today for the first time, and fell in love. We were lured in by the sign out front saying they had craft beers, and even though they were currently out of those, it didn't stop us from having one of our favorite meals in Barcelona. We each got the \"menu of the day\" which included bread, three tapas, a drink, and dessert/cafe for \u20ac11. Every tapa we tried was delicious and we left feeling stuffed and satisfied. Although we didn't try their cocktails, we heard another couple tell the owner that their mojitos were \"perfect\". (4\u20ac)The ambiance was perfect as well. Adorably decorated - no detail was overlooked. The two owners were very nice, fun, and welcoming and spoke fluent Spanish and English. We just ate at the restaurant today for lunch and are already planning on going back tonight for drinks. We feel as though we found a gem!",
