    "We came here for brunch on a weekday morning. The food was delicious--definitely hit the spot after sangria pitchers the night before ;) In all seriousness, it's very tasty and flavorful (with good-sized portions) food for a very reasonable price. The staff was friendly and efficient, and the ambience was trendy and cozy. So far my favorite breakfast/brunch place in Barcelona!",
