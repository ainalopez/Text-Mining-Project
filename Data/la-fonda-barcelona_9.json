    "We ordered black rice. But the rice turn out to be extremely salty and it's almost impossible to eat. I had only a few spoons of it and stopped. It's an extremely aweful experience not to mention the waiter is doing a lousy job , not caring how the food is after seeing that I had a big place left uneaten . I definitely won't recommend this place to anybody!!!!!!!",
