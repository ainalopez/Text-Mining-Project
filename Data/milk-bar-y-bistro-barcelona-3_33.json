    "We went here for brunch. The ambience was nice, and the service was good. We were seated immediately, and we were surrounded by so many delicious looking dishes. My two friends ordered their \u00b4recovery brunches\u00b4. They were both very satisfied, and the portions were huge. I ordered the Morning Glory because I wanted something sweet (french toast topped with greek yogurt and mixed berries). I was excited when I first got it, because it looked like it\u00b4d be a perfect balance of sweet. The greek \u00a0yogurt and berries would add some tart to the french toast\u00b4s sweetness. However, I know french toast isn\u00b4t always sweet, but if you\u00b4re like me (who loves french toast with various sugary syrups), don\u00b4t get the Morning Glory. It tasted like soft toast with tart greek yogurt.However, I know that the other dishes were pretty good, so thus my 4 star review.",
