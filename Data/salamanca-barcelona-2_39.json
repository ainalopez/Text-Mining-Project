    "Our Airbnb host recommended this place but it's not very good. \u00a0The 3 of us had the seafood paella and it was salty, the seafood is not that fresh, the meal is not that cheap, and we are very disappointed. \u00a0There were mostly tourists like us there. \u00a0We should have stuck with our usual rule - if it's crowded with the locals, then go in.",
