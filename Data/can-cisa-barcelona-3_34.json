    "The other reviews are spot on..I don't know much about wine, especially Spanish wine, and the owner was really, really helpful, explained everything to us, where the wines came from, what you should drink them with, how they compared to other wines in the same price range, etc. She even travel wrapped them in cardboard for us. \u00a0 On another note, it was swelteringly hot in this place, so don't plan on spending more than 15 minutes or so.",
