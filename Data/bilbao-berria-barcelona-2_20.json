    "This place is amazing! I absolutely love tapas and the tapas bar here has so much variety. There was a long line to be seated, but me and my friends decided to just stand at the bar to eat, so we didn't have to wait. There is such a wide selection of pintxhos to chose from, and I really enjoyed every one I tried. This place had a different feel than other tapas bars, and the price was very reasonable.",
