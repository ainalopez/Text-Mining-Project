    "What an awesome place for fresh seafood, jamon iberico (aged pork), cheese and large selection of fruit and vegetables. My favorite is peppers and variety of species. Local Olive selection samples along with spicy chorizo, fresh baked bread and hard sheep milk cheese(can't remember the name, but it's Catalunya) made for a great lunch.",
