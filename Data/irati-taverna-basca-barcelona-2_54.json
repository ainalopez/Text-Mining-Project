    "Awesome 40 types of hot and cold Basque pintxos for 1,80 euros/each. \u00a0No seating area, just standing room. \u00a0There were many tourists but each pintxo tapa was presented nicely. \u00a0Tinto de Vernano (summer red wine with spritzers a bit more expensive). It's an honor system:They count the number of toothpicks you have on your plate. Helpful waiter explaining to you what each pintxo you are picking. \u00a0Note to self: Should of tried: Txakoli (sprightly Basque white wine)",
