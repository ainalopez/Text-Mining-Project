    "Searching for an open Japanese restaurant in Barcelona around the holidays (late December) is apparently no easy task... I think everyone goes on vacation! We breathed a huge sigh of relief when found that Tempura-Ya was open. Nice mid-range restaurant, casual and decent prices while still having a slightly upscale vibe. We were welcomed in by the staff with a cheerful \"irraishaimase\" (your standard greeting upon entering most legit Japanese restaurants). I got excited when I realized our server spoke Spanish, Japanese, AND English... the 3 languages I can claim to speak (in varying capacities depending on which one :P).Overall, I'd say the food was solid. Not the best Japanese food I've ever had in my life and no where near the worst. There's a lot of tempura on the menu of course, but they also have sushi and a lot of other typical Japanese items. Tried were the gyoza- tasty and good consistency; tempura udon- noodles good and broth savory and comforting, but the tempura does not come separate and got soggy real fast in the soup; sukiyaki udon- my partner said it hit the spot; tekka maki (basic tuna sushi roll)- clean and simple; and green tea cheesecake- DELICIOSO!If you're a fan of Japanese food and in the area, I'd definitely recommend this place. If I lived in the area, I would probably be a regular!",
