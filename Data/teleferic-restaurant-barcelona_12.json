    "These were the best tapas of our stay in Barcelona.We had to wait abut fifteen minutes on a Sunday night at about 9 just for two seats at the small bar. A local family with young children arrived after we did.If you sit at the bar, the tapas are self-serve which means you get to peruse the large selection (70 items or so) at your own speed. The reviewers who characterized this as analogous to dim sum are spot on - the host counted skewers and plates to come up with the bill.Most memorable at this point a week, and many tapas later, are the grilled octopus and the foie gras, a croquette of bacalao was delicious but would have been better warm. An item similar to \u00a0an eggplant rollatini was also delicious. Garlic prawns are cooked to order and arrived hot and savory-a bit pricier than the others, but a good sized portion.I had two wines, my wife one and we were comped to a glass of cava at the end, a really nice touch.",
