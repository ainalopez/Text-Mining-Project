    "Service - very fast serice. We came here for drinks and within 10 minutes we were served our sangria. Came with complemtary cheese as well. We were in a rush to get to the familia museumAtmosphere - cozy space with decorative me menus and small decor you wouldn't notice right away - but displays have meaning and intention - such as the menu, tissue boxes, napkins, bottlesFood/drink - the sangria is famous for a reason and it did not disappoint. We had the traditional and white wine sangriaNeedless to say, we both could have drank litres of it. 4.5 euros for a giant class or 15 euros for an entire bottle. Worth your value and it can actually fill you upWorth coming back again and again",
