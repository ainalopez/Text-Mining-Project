    "This was very cool place to hang out in the gothic district. The decor was very hipster ish with a large sign advertising erotic movies (just for decor) and many different types of tables, chairs, and wall art. They have many locally brewed beers in bottles, but they were out of the beer I wanted.... and the second beer I wanted... sigh. The husband and I settled on two different beers and they ended up being like IPAs (which I don't like, but he does) so he drank his and the majority of mine. Prices were average for the area.",
