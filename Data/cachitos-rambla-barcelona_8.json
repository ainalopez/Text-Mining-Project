    "The ambience is warm and inviting (the seats are literally warmed up so you're nice and toasty inside.) I was so excited to try Cachitos, especially because of their infamous paella. My boyfriend and I ordered the seafood paella, ham iberico on toast, crab and pineapple on toast, and foie with fig jam on toast.Verdict:-Ham iberico: tasty! Texture is very much like that of prosciutto. The toast is also lightly brushed with a tangy tomato sauce. -Crab and pineapple: delicious. Mixed in a creamy mayo-like sauce that complimented the crunchy toast.-Foie with fig jam: strangely light and refreshing. Texture was like butter, but was overpowered by the sweetness of the fig jam. Weirdly enough, extremely salty between bites. -Paella: absolutely delicious. The rice was cooked just right, and seasoned well. However, I was extremely disappointed with the skimpy amount and variety of seafood. About 1/5 of the paella was actually seafood, which to Cachitos means a few pieces of shrimp and fish here and there. They didn't even include mussels or clams. Are you kidding me? I took off 3 stars for that. Such a shame for a restaurant with great food.",
