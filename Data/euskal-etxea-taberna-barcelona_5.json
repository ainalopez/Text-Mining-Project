    "Very limited seating if you're able to grab a table. Mostly tall tables where you have to stand and eat (so not a great spot if you've been walking/on your feet all day). There are a few tall stools if you're able to snag some. This was the only pintxos bar that we went to while in Barcelona. Pintxos are small snacks typically eaten in bars. Each side of the corner where the pintxos are displayed is the same so no worries on fighting your way to the other side if you're only able to get to one side of the corner.Price: 2\u20ac per stickWe loved the concept of pintxos as you can see the food and just grab it yourself. The food itself was decent but there wasn't anything there that we all tried that we absolutely loved. The house sangria was fairly watery and tasted more like juice. The only time you really see a waiter is when they take your drink order & when you pay. They bill you by counting how many sticks you have on your plate so that's why you don't have your plates cleared away when you have a stack full. Fun experience but wouldn't stay for the food or drink.",
