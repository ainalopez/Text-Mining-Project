    "We were at the Placa Reial and got hungry. We walked around the plaza, which is surrounded by restaurants, checking out the menus. Les Quinze Nits had a line, and the prices were mid range. We decided to get on the line, which moved quickly. This place is huge. It has outdoor seating as well, but there is a surcharge to sit outside. We sat indoors. It was nicely decorated. It was very busy. Waiters seemed a bit overwhelmed. I think this hindered the service. We had their sangria. The food is good, nothing memorable. This is the kind of place I would visit once just to experience it, but wouldn't go to again. It is a tourist spot.",
