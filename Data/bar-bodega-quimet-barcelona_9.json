    "I am going to give them 4 stars, but they probably deserve 5, but I only went once and I will go again and probably update my review. Before the tourism mass invasion that happen sometime in the last 6 years, Barcelona was crowded with this type of bodegas, but the flood of money and some of the original owners retire, most of them had to close the doors. But this guys decided to keep the spirit of the old bodega, update a little the look of the classic menu and keep the prices. And the result is amazing. I went to Quimet because several persons have recommended it and I have to say that it wasn't the best time to go: A Saturday at 2-3pm. It was packet. But we were lucky and in 5 min we were able to get a spot at the bar. We ordered the vermouth (1,3 euros, the cheapest I have found in this city) and some tapas. I have to say that the ensaladilla rusa was one of the best I remember. The esqueixada was exquisite and their variado (a medley of different type of cockel, anxoves, tuna and razor clam with olives, served with pa amb tomaquet) is simply amazing. The vermouth is served without ice and with olive, as it should be, and you can add soda to it if you ask to the personnel. \u00a0We end up paying around 20 euros for two and we were full and happy. I hope this guys will never change their mind and will keep the place as it is today, as it was before.",
