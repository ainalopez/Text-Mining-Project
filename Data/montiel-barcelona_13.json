    "Ridiculously good! On a three-stop gastronomic journey through Paris, Barcelona, and Florence, this was my 2nd favorite meal--and a close 2nd, at that. \u00a0If you're going to Barcelona and love food, get a reservation as soon as you can! It's also not the easiest restaurant to find, so give yourself plenty of time to get there. I don't know how often the menu changes, but we enjoyed the Gastronomic Menu for 65 Euros, with a wine pairing at 30 Euros. \u00a0So much good food and drink! Honestly, everything was absurdly good, with wonderful ingredients and outstanding preparation. \u00a0A few standouts were the \"Ox of Wagyu from Burgos,\" the \"Foie Micuit Salad,\" and the \"Origin of the Truffle.\" The Origin of the Truffle was mind boggling! The chef used actual truffles in the dessert! The flavor combination was amazing. The atmosphere in the restaurant was great, with interesting looking art on the walls, but a simple table set up so there was no pretension. \u00a0The servers were kind, helpful, and funny! \u00a0We were one of the last tables left in the place, and our server was incredibly chatty (in a good way, not that he wouldn't leave us alone!) about the food, the wine, the city, etc. \u00a0The chef even came out and signed a menu for me =)If you've read my reviews, you know that I've been lucky enough to go to some amazing restaurants in my life. \u00a0This one certainly makes it into a top 10 list; it might even make it into top 5, but I need more time to think about that =) \u00a0Just go! You can thank me later!",
