    "I was actually annoyed with how popular this place is. It's hard to give 2 stars to a place that packs 200 people into the space for 40. Literally. Service wasn't great because it's basically the nuttiest bar you've ever been to and the bartenders/waiters/servers can take your order or ignore you at their discretion. Menu is short and listed prominently on the wall... but wait, on that wall there's more menu. And over there I see another set of menus?! I don't get it, what's good? They basically have grilled fatty meats on scrumptious bread (which of course is delicious!). But whether you want bottifara or lomo or the house smoked cheese with your lomo or fuet or about 25 other combos makes it more than an obvious ordering session. I touched on it before; this place is PACKED. You will eat uncomfortably with 8 people bumping into you left, right, and center. And behind you, two more from the left, and one more stepping on your feet!This place is a staple. It's a hole in the wall and worth a visit. Once.",
