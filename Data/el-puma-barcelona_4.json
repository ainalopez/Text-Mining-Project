    "Excellent buffet to try Catalan and Spainish food. We heard about a 10 Euro buffet (normally 20) and thought it was a trick to get you into the door and gore you with crazy drink prices and service charges, however, this was not the case at all. Our large party entered the restaurant and there was only another table occupied. This made us quite worried especially walking by a large selection of food on the way to the be seated. There's no way this place would make all this food and not have any business. So anyway, we ordered a pitcher of Sangria for 12 Euros (not bad) and proceeded to the buffet line. I skipped all the \"bread\" tapas to avoid being too full to try everything. I have to say the food was delicious and hot. I didn't touch anything on the salad/appetizer food table and I was so full from the evening. A nice surprise was the grill where the master would cook to order any of the beautiful protein laid out. The staff and service was great. Don't miss the freezer packed with ice cream bars and cups. Wow, what a great experience for 10 Euros. Don't miss this place if you're ever in Barcelona. I don't think we saw a single tourist there ... except for each other. Oh, and by the time we left the place, the restaurant was packed with patrons! I only wish we had hit this place on our first day so we didn't need to spend crazy money on fancier tapa bars.",
