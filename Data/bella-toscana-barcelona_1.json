    "We got into town a little after lunch and needed a quick bite before exploring the city. We sat down in the terrace and enjoyed an ice cold Estrella and some Sangria. Our server was Arif who was on point and very friendly. We needed up going with the margarita pizza and it was some of the best pizza I've had in years. \u00a0We ended up coming back the next day and Arif not only remembered us but also what we ordered for food and drink. The second time we tried the jamon and fungi and it was better than the first. Highly recommend for pizza and drinks on the terrace.",
