    "The service was excellent. The food was average, although if we would have ordered off the specialty menu, we may have had a better experience. The place is dark with very low ceilings and the seating is less than comfortable. The carbonara was too salty and the marinara was almost non existent on the plate. OK, but does not live up to the ratings, many of those 5 stars must be from friends and family. The people running the place knew everyone that walked in to eat.",
