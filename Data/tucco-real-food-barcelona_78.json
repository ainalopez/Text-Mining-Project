    "Absolutely as reviewed here on Yelp. Visited Tucco on a Wednesday night with my mom and uncle (family vacation). As we walked in we were greeted at the front and had the menu explained in great detail with personal recommendations. We all ordered the Ravioli Rellenos, specialty of the house we were told. Our meal included one empanada (I ordered the leek and cheese, my mom the mozzarella with seasoning, both delicious), a plate each of ravioli filled with rocket/arugula, pine nuts and pesto (also delicious and I ate every bite), your choice of dessert (we sampled the brownie, tiramisu, and dulce de leche, all fantastic). Oh, and a glass of wine or beer. All of this for \u20ac9.95 per person.The staff were incredibly friendly and happy to have us as guests. The food was all house made and full of flavor. We will be back again before the trip is through. Thank you Tucco!",
