    "What an unexpectedly awesome place to eat! \u00a0We walked there because of the good Yelp reviews, and it ended up being worth the walk from our place in Old City.The highlights: \u00a0our Waitress Anna was awesome. \u00a0Spoke great English and was just a ton of fun. \u00a0All of our dinner entrees were really great, and the dinner was awesome. \u00a0I recommend the duck or the veal. We also had the cookie for dessert, I highly recommend it. \u00a0It had a really neat design, and a really fun staff. \u00a0If you are in the area, you will not be disappointed. \u00a0It was about \u20ac50 for the two of us with 2 drinks and desserts. \u00a0Two thumbs up!-love,Philly friends",
