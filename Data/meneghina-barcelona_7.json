    "Tonight we had an amazing dining experience at Menegrina. \u00a0We got to speak with Arianna, who is the owner, and she guided us through the menu and the decor. \u00a0The interior is very beautiful, all painted white, and where there were holes in the original stones, old cups, plates, and figurines have been placed. \u00a0The whole interior to the menu is very inspirational and artistic. \u00a0The house red wine was from a small winery in Rioja and was done in small batches, the proprietor didn't even make labels for the wine. \u00a0We shared a plate of Italian cheeses which was excellent. \u00a0My wife had the handmade gnocchi and I had the rabbit with polenta. \u00a0Both dishes were spectacular and very creative. \u00a0 Their desserts were fantastic as well. \u00a0This was our date night in Barcelona and it was one well-spent. \u00a0We will be going back and telling our friends. \u00a0If you want Italian cuisine with a Catalan flair, this is your place!The fresh pasta with blue fish is fantastic as is the ragu. \u00a0You must eat here!",
