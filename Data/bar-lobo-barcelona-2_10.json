    "I had to get over myself and resign to the fact that European service just cannot be compared with American service, before I could write a satisfactory review. Everything about Lobo was excellent, except the terrible reception and service we initially got. We were greeted upon entering the premise by a server who even told us where to sit, and then disappeared for a good amount of time. My courageous friend got up twice to fetch us food and drink menus, and there were two other American diners sitting two tables away from us who quipped, \"yeah, serve yourselves.\" After another while, the couple sitting next to us got up and left. It wasn't until then that we realized they had been sitting there, ignored, until they just decided to leave since their table was empty the whole time. All in all, not an auspicious start to a good dinner.After we finally got someone who came over to take our order, everything went smoothly from there. The cava sangria was great, and we shared champi\u00f1ones fritos and patatas bravas as starters. The mushrooms were excellent, but after our respective main courses we just could not finish them. My arroz a la marinera had a good portion and a generous amount of seafood; it also did not take forever despite the 20-minute warning on the menu.Lobo has a good ambiance that's modern and sleek; it's also rather expansive and located in a good area, but not too overwhelmed with swarms of people passing by since it's a block off la Rambla. The large windows also provide good views for the street. There's a bar in the center of the place, I assume good for grabbing drinks on a casual night. I would come back, but I'll be ready to brace for the Spanish style service I may initially receive, again.",
