    "I was happy with the 'piadina' I ordered from this fast food place (which I think was a second location as it was located at Carrer de l'Allada-Vermell 19), which cost about 5 euro and was similar to a doner kebab but distinct. They have a variety of combinations to satisfy many different palates, and in the center of Barcelona it isn't easy to find a cheap bite to eat. The man behind the counter who was making the food & working the register was very friendly.",
