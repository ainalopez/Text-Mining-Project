    "I have eaten from here twice now (once to go and the other sitting in) and I have been extremely satisfied both visits. Eden is a great place to go for a nice Italian meal that won't break the bank. An average entree is around 10-13 euros but the portions are well worth the price. You are definitely getting your money's worth. They have an extensive selection of pizzas and pastas all made right there so your meal will always come out fresh. Whenever I order a pizza, I usually have enough to take home for a meal later on. The staff is very friendly and they speak English so if you're visiting Barcelona from out of town, this would be a great place to stop where you wouldn't have to struggle ordering food. You can dress up a little if you want or just wear a nice casual outfit. My friends and I went here to celebrate a birthday, another friend brought her boyfriend here for a date, and another friend brought her family here for dinner. All had fantastic experiences so Eden can really work for whatever occasion.",
