    "We could not have asked for a better place to eat on our last night in Barcelona.We were seated right away despite not having reservations. Even though we preferred to sit outside while we were in Barcelona, the ambiance of Ikibana is amazing. I would definitely eat inside to experience it. Drinks- Their bloody Mary is amazing! It has pureed celery in it and just tasted absolutely amazing. Food-We tried the 33Euro tasting menu which was absolutely perfect. They said the portions were \"smaller\", but it was more than enough food for two people. It came with two appetizers, three rolls, two warm dishes, and two desserts. I can't speak to the authenticity of the Brazilian part of the fusion, but the rolls were fresh and amazing. I also can't say enough about the service here. We had several servers and the manager checking on us frequently. They exceeded all of our needs and expectations. Overall, just a great experience!Poble Sec Metro station is a short walk from Ikibana.",
