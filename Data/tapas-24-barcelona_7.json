    "Did not even get to eat here...Actually did not even get to sit here!Stood there for over 10 minutes waiting to be greeted and nobody ever dared to ask if I even cared for a drink. After 10 minutes I looked for a waiter if he could put me on a waiting list and he was so rude and simply said NO. I asked another waiter and she gave me a look and did not even respond....Do not waste your time. Go around the corner to 336. They have a 3 course meal that includes a glass of CAVA for \u20ac27. Delicious!!! AND SERVICE IS GREAT! Something this tapas place will never be able to say.",
