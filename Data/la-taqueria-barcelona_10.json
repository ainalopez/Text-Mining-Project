    "Make sure you have reservations for a Friday night (understandable). \u00a0Although we didn't have reservations we were seated, because a table didn't show up for their reservation time. \u00a0As a starter we ordered the nachos which were good, took a while for them to come out though. \u00a0 My boyfriend and I both ordered tacos (4 for 8 Euros). They only come with onions and cilantro, and they also took such a long time to come out... That was really the only down fall. \u00a0Customer service was great!This took care of my taco withdrawals while spending 10+ days in Europe.",
