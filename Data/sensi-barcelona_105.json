    "Everything about Sensi is well thought out. \u00a0The food is amazing - we went twice and each dish was awesome. \u00a0Tapas were served in well thought out order. \u00a0The staff is friendly and thoughtful. \u00a0A reservation will help but is not necessary. \u00a0It's small so go early or late. \u00a0Delicious!!",
