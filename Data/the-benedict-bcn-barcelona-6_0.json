    "While looking up some places to have a little breakfast, I stumbled upon Benedict and I could tell my wife would like it. The decor is pretty cool with the English theme they have going on and the food make the place even better. My wife had the Eggs Benedict Riojana and I had the American Breakfast (of course) with Chorizo on the side. My breakfast reminded me of my moms....that's a good thing! Hers looked and tasted really good as well. The Chorizo in the Benedict was solid. We cleaned our plates! Coffee is really good too btw...Food was really good! I would come back and/or recommend this place for sure.",
