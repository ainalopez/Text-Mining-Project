    "On our last night in Barcelona, I wanted to treat my mom to something special. We had been eating our way through Spain by bouncing between caf\u00e9s for wine and tapas- definitely not a bad thing but I wanted to switch it up and have more of a sit down dinner for our final meal. The atmosphere at Bar Mut felt special from the moment we sat down. When I didn't know what wine to order, the waiter looked at me and asked, \"\u00bfconf\u00edas en m\u00ed?\" I'm so glad I did.... I love vino tinto and I probably drank an average of 4-5 glasses every day for the two weeks of our vacation- the wine that I had at Bat Mut was the best I've tasted not only in Spain but possibly in my life. The food matched the deliciousness of the wine, and I'd particularly recommend the spinach salad with Serrano cheese melted on the bottom and the braised pulpo. We also ate our first dessert of the entire trip (well worth the wait), a perfect torrija with goat cheese ice cream. No, this wasn't a spot for a great deal- but the incredibly attentive waitstaff, a well-paced meal, and the quality of wine and food made for an amazing night. Highly recommended.",
