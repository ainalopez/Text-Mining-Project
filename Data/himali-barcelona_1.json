    "We decided to take a break from Spanish and Catalan food and eat something more familiar; Nepalese. We chose a prefix non vegetarian assortment. Of course the naan is always my favorite. I also enjoyed the chicken tikka and chicken curry, but everything was good. Something new was the dessert; a milk curd(yogurt) shake! Yummy. A nice break and good to feel full.",
