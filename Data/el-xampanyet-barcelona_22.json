    "This place was the ABSOLUTE HIGHLIGHT of my visit to Barcelona. ABSOLUTE. HIGHLIGHT. Two MUST ORDERS: the shrimps (Las gambas) & the champagne (xampanyet). The shrimp just freaking MELTS in your mouth and is so fresh, you could swear they just pulled it off a boat. If I had the chance to go back, I would absolutely order 5 plates of the shrimp, no problem. SERIOUSLY though, forgot what any other review has said- GET THE SHRIMP. You will thank me later, I promise. In other news, their house cava and champagne are both wonderfully fruity and light. As a burgeoning wine-o (read: recent college grad attempting to become more classy), these two beverages were a true highlight of our entire trip in Spain. Tl;dr shrimp and champagne. Get this, turn your phone off, stop reading and get this NOW.",
