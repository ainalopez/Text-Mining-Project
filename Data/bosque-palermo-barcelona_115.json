    "I was looking for a local place, non-tourist, to take my father who is a chef back in NY. He loves Paella but hates touristy food. Imagine how hard it is to satisfy him as his standards are quite high. \u00a0After some research I found this place and decided to give it a try. Keep in mind that I am not a Paella lover as I do not eat seafood, but my wife and father just went crazy here. They ordered a seafood paella to split and fell in love with the place. My father said it was the best paella he had eaten in years and would go back time after time. My wife could not stop eating as she also loved the dish. I, the carnivore in the family, had the veal paillard milanese and it was quite good as well. This place is all about Paella though so if that is what you desire, go and feat to your heart's content as I am sure you will love it. The place itself is small, local, and quite comfortable. The service was great and the people there were very attentive to us. Highly recommended for a great Paella and whatever else they offer!",
