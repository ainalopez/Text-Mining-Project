    "Mmm, this place was so fab. A plethora of delicious empanadas made from fresh produce. Stellar service and opened late.The best deal around - a big ass salad + two empanadas of your choice + any drink (alcohol included) + coffee = 10.30 euros. Huh??All of the empanadas we tried were delicious - eggplant, asparagus, mushroom + cheese, chicken, etc.But the unsuspecting star was the ridiculous salads. Words don't do them justice. These were the most satisfying salads ever. It was more like a bunch of wonderful stuff laid out on a plate for you. Fresh greens, slices of tomatoes, grilled zucchini, hunks of brie, dollops of burrata with honey drizzled over it, melon balls, orange slices, walnuts, parmesan crisp wrapped around grilled veggies...yes. It was nuts and we loved it! Definitely shareable.The staff rocks - all of them. If I lived in Barcelona, I'd be here nearly every day.Thank you Rekons for the wodnerful food and hospitality! And to the couple who overstayed their welcome at the outdoor table by making out and going up each other's skirt/pants - take that sh*t home and let someone else have a table.",
