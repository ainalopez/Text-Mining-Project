    "I went here last night for dinner. \u00a0It was fantastic. I had the \"Pavo Milanesa\" which is lightly fried and crispy turkey, served with delicious french fries. I also had a bottle of the house rose and the house salad. \u00a0Fantastic. \u00a0Our server Joanna, was very attentive and kind and even let us buy some bottles of wine to go. \u00a0I highly recommend Bosque Palermo.",
