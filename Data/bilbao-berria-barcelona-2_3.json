    "I absolutely love this place. \u00a0 When you want tapas and you want to try all the different kinds and you can pick and choose whatever you think you want its a completely win win situation. \u00a0 And the prices were totally reasonable. \u00a0 They just count the toothpicks. :) \u00a0 It has everything from sweet to savory.",
