    "There are already plenty of reviews on this place so I'm not going to say much other than:- Service is quick and the staff are friendly and helpful even though most of them don't speak a word of English.- All items are super fresh and everything I tried was fantastic! (12 different hot pintxos)- Inexpensive, especially compared to other tapas/pintxos bars in the more touristy areas of the city. (1.60 Euro/Pintxos) - Casual setting.Bottom line, highly recommended if you're visiting Barcelona!Thanks Sheron E. for the recommendation!",
