    "Great for dinner or just tapas & people-watching - located just outside one end of the Born Cultural Centre...Tapas - decided to stop here for a beer, got tempted by the Meat tapas and enticed by the waiter to have tomato bread to accompany this. Great choice and both dishes beautifully prepared & presented and delicious. I wanted to have a look inside at the decor and the waiters encouraged me in to have a look around & happy for me to take photos - really helpful, friendly staff & I loved the floating bottle wine rack.Dinner - having seen the innovative menu we went back a few days later for dinner & sat in the back. We had some Pica-picas (small dishes) which were fab followed by mains of Cod with onion/potato/liquorice & baby cuttlefish on black rice - both fresh, with beautifully balanced flavours & perfectly cooked. Cod and liquorice - who knew? We asked for wine recommendations from the waiter for the starter & main and were not disappointed (& they weren't the most expensive on the menu either - one was the cheapest they did). We had to have dessert now, so opted for Catalan cream foam with raspberries - super soft and light like a velout\u00e9 version of berries & cream - inspired.",
