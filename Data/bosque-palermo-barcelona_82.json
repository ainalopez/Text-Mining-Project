    "This is a great, casual, and friendly restaurant. Very brightly lit though. We ordered the grilled meats and grilled seafood platters and both were very good. A lot of food for two though so consider sharing. The house wine was a little sweet for our taste but the house bottle of Rioja was good. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.",
