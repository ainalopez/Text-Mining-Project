    "A friend and I decided to eat here after seeing the positive Yelp reviews. Best decision! If you like paella, you must must eat here! We ate paella at several places during our visit and we literally went to heaven here. The paella here was so flavorful, moist and cooked perfectly. Also, try the onions. They were also delicious. As well as the vino from the jug. We went back!!",
