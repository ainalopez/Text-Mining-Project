    "We had some trouble finding the place, but it was probably the best seafood I've ever had. They have raw seafood out for display, and you choose what and much you want as well as how you want it cooked. The cold prawns were great, and the tuna steak was amazing. They actually mixed up our tuna steak temperature (well done) with another group's (medium rare) but medium rare ended up being perfect. The meal also comes with some sauces that you can choose from, some better than others. There's also a seafood soup you can add to your meal that includes mussels that is very flavorful. The only thing is that it is a little cramped since it gets pretty crowded and you do have to keep going up to pick up your food from the kitchen when it's ready, but it's definitely worth it. Also, our group ordered entirely in Spanish, so I'm not totally sure how much English a person would be able to use to order. The signs for the seafood were also entirely in Spanish.",
