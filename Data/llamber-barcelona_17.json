    "Great find. Our hotel recommended it to us. Definitely not the place for a picky or unadventurous eater. We were disappointed they didn't serve sangria, but the tapas were interesting and good. Service takes their time so definitely say something if you're in a rush.the salmon carpaccio was fantastic. Also black rice with cuttlefish was excellent. Good for a long lunch or dinner.",
