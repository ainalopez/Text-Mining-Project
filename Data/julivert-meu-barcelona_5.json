    "We were only in Barcelona for five days, and we certainly ate lots of good food, but this was easily the best meal. We began as a group of three, but were joined late by two friends and the lovely waitstaff accommodated us with good humor. Started with a bunch of dishes, including the typical Catalan roasted bread with tomato, Carpaccio de bacalao, Escalivada con queso de cabra (various roasted veg, served cold and dressed with a fat slice or two of goat cheese, gently sugared and caramelized--sounds terrible, but was delicious!), and R\u00facula y queso parmesano. Followed by mains: Butifarra con jud\u00edas (sausage with perfectly buttery and subtly seasoned white beans), Costillas de cordero a la brasa (perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned slim loin lamb chops), and Pollo a la brasa. Accompanied by a sangria de cava, too sweet for some of us, but exactly right to others in the group. Desserts and coffee were only good, apart from the house-made chocolate mousse--outstanding, not too sweet. Atmosphere was equally enjoyable--excellent warm service, rustic without being fake. Very conveniently located, right off La Rambla close to Placa Catalunya, without feeling touristy at all. When I go back to Barcelona, I will certainly return for another meal. Many, many thanks to Mauro for the recommendation!",
