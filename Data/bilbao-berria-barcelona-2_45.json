    "The best part of this place is that you get to walk up to the tapas bar and pick whatever lights up your eyes (and stomach). The tapas here are \u20ac1.65 per plate! The flat rate makes it easy to graze without guilt or regret. Plus the portions are generous for the price. You can keep track of your bill by counting the number of sticks in the mini silver vase. My favorite tapas was the salmon with egg. Best dessert was the crema catalana, possibly the best in the area considering the price.",
