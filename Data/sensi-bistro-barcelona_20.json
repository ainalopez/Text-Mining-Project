    "I would consider this modern Spanish tapas. \u00a0Great food, cozy environment, and very friendly wait staff made this a winner in my book. \u00a0Ahi tuna was very fresh, ravioli was al dente and delicious, and the flank steak was tender. Would probably pass on the pork ribs next time and the cheesecake dulce de leche was just OK... \u00a0Prices were reasonable for the quality of food and a bottle of wine.",
