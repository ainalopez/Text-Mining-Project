    "Craft beers on draft. A fridge ful of Spain's best beers, especially IPAs. This is the closest I ever felt to home in the USA. It feels like a dive bar, but the crowd isn't so divey. A guy sat at the piano downstairs and played around through the evening while friends hung around in small circles or barside conversation. I LOVED the vibe and recommend it as a primetime evening spot after dinner or before going out.",
