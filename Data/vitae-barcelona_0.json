    "Outstanding value, great quality and very friendly. Received free cocktail and a glass of wine. There was great authentic Spanish music. The dishes tasted amazingly fresh, best olives I've had in my entire life. Waiters took the time to explain the dishes. \u00a0Dishes were very nicely plated, om the level of a 4 star restaurant. Bill was 36 euro for 2 persons including drinks, main course and desert.",
