    "We came here for two reasons....because the reviews were so good and because it was open late. \u00a0Maybe the late part was the problem, because the food we saw in the case at the bar clearly had been sitting there for quite a while and the staff was impatient..hardly representative of every other establishment we've patronized since arriving in BCN. Maybe it's better earlier. \u00a0Maybe it's better any other night except Mondays. Or maybe my spoiled Vegas foodie self is just too picky...you be the judge.",
