    "Easily one of the best fast food places to get Thai food especially if you are on the go. They have kind of like a \"choose and create your own dish\" style of menu where you can choose what kind of noodles then what meats and ingredients you would like to add on your cup. Price is pretty reasonable assuming you are not like me and pick most of the ingredients.Sometimes the line can get quite long but we'll worth the wait. I have come here 3 times and looking to come back some more!.",
