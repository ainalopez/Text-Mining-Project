    "We came here on a recommendation from wallpaper (they usually have great places to go to). \u00a0 The venue is very nice and quite appealing. \u00a0The food is ok (some people may like it but we are picky on food). \u00a0 However this review is about their \u00a0zero rate service. \u00a0 \u00a0And I am not exaggerating. \u00a0 \u00a0The girl at the bar is so stressed and doesn't even look at us and when she was talking to us to take our order she was talking to 4 other people and interrupted us several times. \u00a0 I am usually forgiving when it comes to service but not at this place. \u00a0 Avoid this place and Wallpaper you did bad this time.",
