    "My wife and i finally made it here after two previous attempts where it was closed. Quaint little place with nice ambiance.With the great reviews we were expecting a lot. Unfortunately, we were disappointed.The potatoes were good... Steamed, simple and clean with a tasty rosemary sauce (menu said sage), but good nonetheless.I ordered an octopus tapa. It was nicely prepared, but the sauce was awkward. It was a creamy, cheesy concoction with some red oil that tasted fine, but didn't really go with octopus.For mains, my wife ordered a white bean, eggplant, and mozzarella plate which looked beautiful, but was served cold. That was weird.I ordered a lamb kabob. I was served a lamb wrap. Again, tasted fine, but it was not a 13 euro burrito.We were given bread which was nice even though we didn't ask for it, but there was a charge for it on the bill.Interestingly enough, we've been super happy about all the other places in Barcelona we've eaten. This is the only place that asked us if we wanted to add a tip to our bill which was uncomfortable - tipping for us is usually relatively anonymous.",
