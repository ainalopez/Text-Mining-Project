    "I highly recommend this restaurant. I had an amazing dinner, the best meal I've had so far in barcelona. The resturant is walking distance from the Provenca and Diagonal metro stops. The waiter recommended a tapa that consisted of grilled octopus and papa bravas, don't remember the exact name, but it was awesome.",
