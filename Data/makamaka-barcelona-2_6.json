    "If you're in the mood for a burger or salad I highly recommend this place. \u00a0Service is friendly and fast. \u00a0Food is great. \u00a0I ordered the Jamaican chicken salad - it comes with dark meat chicken which is the most tender chicken I've ever tasted. \u00a0Combine that with the avocado, kalamata olives and dressing makes this salad one of the best I've ever tasted. \u00a0My friend order the \"dude\" burger and said it was great as well. \u00a0We shared an order of their garlic / parmesan fries - yum! I want to go back. \u00a0The wait staff is very attentive.",
