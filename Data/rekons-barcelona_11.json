    "I'm still a fan, but today I was sorely disappointed by the food that they served. \u00a0I ordered my favorite - potatoes and 4 cheese. \u00a0Usually an ooey gooey mess of potato cheesey goodness. And I also ordered 2 empanadas. \u00a0Everything came out COLD. \u00a0the outside was warm, but the inside was stone cold. \u00a0UGH!!! I love this place so much, and hate to think that their standards have dropped. \u00a0Hopefully they just need to get a new oven.I will still be back for more, but skeptically.",
