    "Ok Yelp, I have you to thank for this one. I went out of my way for Maitea Taberna, all because I was told by my good friend Yelp that this is the spot for excellent tapas. I will say, the hype was a little overboard, as it was good, not outstanding as I was hoping, but still not sad I went. I wouldn't make a point to hit it up again, but again, not bad at all. I liked that it was very reasonably priced and it offered a lot of variety in the way of tapas choices. Don't forget to save your toothpicks! I had about 5 of the tapas and they were mostly all good - I think there was one I wasn't crazy about, but overall satisfied with them.",
