    "Thanks to other feedback, we decided to try Casa Alfonso for ourselves. We definitely weren't let down. We ordered the black risotto and porcini risotto with a few tapas to accompany. Everything was delicious. Only thing that wasn't perfect were the squid rings, a bit too soft so probably not as fresh as the rest. Nice atmosphere, busy but not hectic, staff very attentive and friendly. Good thing they told us to stop at a certain number of tapas as it was just the perfect amount.Will definitely come back as we didn't get to try any of the ham this place is known for!",
