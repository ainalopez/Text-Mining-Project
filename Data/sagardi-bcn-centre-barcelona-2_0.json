    "Stopped by here on my walk through Barcelona and I needed directions and some wifi. They were kind enough to provide me with both as long as I purchased something. With tapas starting at $2 it was well worth it. I had a ham and cheese on a croissant which was good but pretty standard. The standout item here was this thing that looked (and tasted like) it was topped with a blueberry jam and under that a type of cream cheese. It was unbelievably delicious. They also made a sangria cocktail that was pretty good as well. If you are in the area it is worth the stop in.",
