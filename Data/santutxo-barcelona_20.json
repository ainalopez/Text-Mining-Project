    "After a quick Internetsearch we found this place. It really was exactly as others have described. Delicious and different tapas served by a congenial owner who is enthusiastic about giving diners a good time and value for money. We were five people including three teenagers one allergic to nuts and one who won't eat seafood so pleasing us is sometimes difficult. However, we all found several things we wanted to try and none of us was unsatisfied after the meal. The ambience in the garden at the back of the restaurant was friendly and congenial and we talked with other people at other tables, all of whom agreed that the restaurant was a \"find\".Don't be shy to ask the owner for recommended dishes and follow his advice regarding portions. He won't try to sell you the most expensive or too much.",
