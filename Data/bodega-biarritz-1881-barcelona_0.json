    "This couple and team provide fresh and inspirational tapas to a small group. \u00a024 max seating ( but usually 18 ) people at a time, is an alter of freshness. 24 man hours of daily preparation ends up with 30+ high gastro quality tapas offerings. Served until gone. With a line growing each minute. Accompanied my fresh Mojito's, Sangria, Jarra ( beer ) and others the cocktails are secondary to the creations of the partner team. From Basque region originally, note the decorations in the back, up high, this couple of four years in Barcelona will need a serious new space to serve the masses. Simple and fresh is the key element. They let the garlic dance, but not stay in the pallet. Tomatoes wonder with the peppers but not too much. Goat cheese is a hint to the broccoli filling on one and is enough. Which one to try? Tapas, Tapa, Tapas.....try them all. \u00a0Muchas Gracias for simplicity and fresh approach.",
