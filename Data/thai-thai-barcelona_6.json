    "This authentic thai is a great little place to grab a bite. The service is friendly and the meals do come fairly quickly (however they don't push you off the tables, and they are happy to delay the next course). I have been a few times, with 2-8 people. The second table on the left for 2 people is where I normally sit. \u00a0Regarding the food, it is true thai and they don't dull down the flavor like many spanish Thai restaurants. One of the better, value for money places to eat that I have found in Barcelona.",
