    "The place comes highly recommended by the NYT travel section, though I'll admit what clinched it was a combination of fatigue, hunger, and the fact it was only a 10 euro cab ride from where we were staying. The cute patio was breezier than expected- the wind off the water is pretty strong and remarkably cool for June- so we ended up eating upstairs next to the huge bank of windows overlooking the water instead, still good for distant people-watching and enjoying the view.My first meal in Spain needed to have two things- paella and sangria, and boy did Barraca deliver. The meal begins with a complimentary dish of wee pickled onions and olives [utterly delicious] and bread that [per usual in Europe] comes with a minor charge along with the water. Our Sangria came quickly and did not disappoint, probably the best I had my whole trip. Knowing the paella would be big, we only ordered one appetizer- little toasts rubbed with tomato with an anchovy filet on them, which were quite tasty. The paella itself \u00a0was a slightly crisped pan of glorious dark rice studded with mussels and clams and chunks of fish and we scraped the thing clean before ordering dessert. The sweets were a big round icecream rolled in nut crunch with chocolate mousse on top and a heap of glorious sweetened stuff similar to cottage cheese covered in berries, both quite tasty. While pricey, we left feeling satisfied with everything, which is the only way I know to gauge whether something is worth the expense.",
