    "Easily the best authentic mexican food I've had in Spain. That's not saying much though, so I'll go ahead & say that their tacos al pastor are easily in my top 5 worldwide (keep in mind that I'm from California & visit Mexico often)! Since moving to Barcelona, I've been missing flavorful meat and spicy salsas & La Taqueria has filled that hole in my life. The atmosphere inside is very cool with good music, and the staff is SUPER friendly. My only gripe is that you have to order 4 of the same type of taco, no mixing & matching... & it's a bit pricey (a little less than 10\u20ac for 4 tacos and a soda) but don't get me wrong, that's totally not going to stop me from coming back here 3-4 times per week. I'll gladly pay Spanish prices for this amazing Mexican food.EDIT: Don't try coming on a weekend night without a reservation. You MIGHT be able to get a seat if you show up before they open, but otherwise it's pretty tough.",
