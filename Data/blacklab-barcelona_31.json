    "Loved it! Top notch beer & food - went far beyond a standard bar food menu. I really liked the way they seemed to focus on serving local beers. There was a sizable inside area and an outdoor patio. Everyone on the staff was super friendly, most spoke very good English, and the service was excellent overall. We went here twice during our 1 week stay in Barcelona.",
