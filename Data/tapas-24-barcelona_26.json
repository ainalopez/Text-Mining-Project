    "Bikini sandwich- iberico jam, cheese and black truffle. Sounds simple, but delicious. Wish the bread was more crispy but the flavor a were good. They use a simple white bread. 4 small pieces Bomba- fried potato meat ball. It's like mushed meat with mashed potato fries in a ball. Really good. Comes with garlic mayo and a spicy sauce but it's not spicy or garlicky at all. Pretty good. 1 medium sized ballPotatoes bravas- lightly fried thicker fries with garlic mayo and spicy sauce. Looks so plain but whatever they do to the fries is pretty darn good. They must either cook it in some kind of fat or use some kind of special salt cause it was pretty good.Chicken croquette- just ok. Fried mashed chicken meat in a Pablo crust type covering.Foie gras burger. So delicate and tiny but so rich and decadent. Pretty good.Come early . Place gets packed. Agree with other reviewers that for the portion size, it's pretty pricey be other tapas joints.",
