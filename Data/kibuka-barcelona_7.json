    "This was a welcome break after eating tapas for 3 nights in a row. Great food and fantastic atmosphere for a sunday night - was really busy. Staff were a little snooty and it was difficult to get their attention, perhaps they don't like tourists. But that didn't spoil our experience all in all. Reasonable prices.",
