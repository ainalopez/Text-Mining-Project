    "We were in dire need of an actual meal and not just tapas and drinks. Thank goodness for the Milk Bar. La Classica hamburger was delicious! Big enough for 2 to split. The Caesar salad was great. The grilled chicken on top was cooked perfectly (leading me to think the grilled chicken sandwich would've been delicious). My boyfriend got the steak sandwich...it was not on his plate longer than 5 minutes. He said it was delicious, the bread it came on was very good! Both came with fries! Provided homemade ketchup, hot sauce, and siracha. SO GOOD!!Service was great! Spanish speaking but also spoke English too, making it easy to order. A bit small but great experience overall!! Will return for brunch for sure!,,,",
