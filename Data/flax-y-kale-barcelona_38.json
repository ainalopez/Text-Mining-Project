    "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona if you are looking for something raw, vegeterian, or just delicious and healthy. I have had the raw zucchini lasagna, and it was hands down one of the best meals I ate in Barcelona, vegeterian, or not. The juices are great to take to go and everything is guilt free and flavor-full!",
