    "After walking around in the Gothic area, my friend and I were confused to see this place. It looked like a grungy dive that we would find in the East Village. After dinner and going in, it ended up look just like one of our favorite places in NYC, Double Down Saloon.The place is simply (excuse my French) badass bar. It feels dirty inside, in a good way .The walls are covered with pictures of rock stars and metal gods, surrounded by graffiti everywhere. You can get your simple Estrella bottle of beer, or a drink with a gimmicky name. They also have some kickass t-shirts with skulls, fire, and other macho symbolism, which is my favorite form of souvenir from a trip.Despite being in Barcelona for less than a week, my friend and I found ourselves here on two nights. If you're not in the mood for a crazy club night, this is surely a great way to spend a night at a dive and having a some beers.",
