    "This was recommended by local as a really good spot for Spanish food and it was definitely popular and filled with lots of people, tourists and locals alike. \u00a0The service was decent and the food was pretty good. \u00a0I'm not a huge fan of Spanish cuisine, but if you are, this is probably a good spot to visit since it has everything tapas style and everything tasted similar to other Spanish dishes I've had in the past.We shared a few different dishes including some grilled beef, French fries and beans mixed with roasted vegetables - everything was cooked well. \u00a0The atmosphere is very lively and perfect spot to visit if you're visiting Barcelona and want to experience some of the great nightlife.",
