    "This is a true bar scene, so don't go in with false expectations. The food is absolutely great, especially the vegan burgers. One of the people in our party didn't like their beet burger, but everyone else loved the food (especially the nachos with guacamole and sweet potato fries). The only reason I would give Ale & Hop less than five stars is the service. Service was reeaally slow since there was only one person working all the tables. (They also missed a couple of orders at first.) I'll bet that if they staffed a second person for tables these issues would be resolved. Don't let that take away from the food, though, which is really great!",
