    "Was excited to eat here after reading the reviews, but bitterly disappointed with the paella. \u00a0I believe they must have finished it off under the broiler which left all the protein dry. \u00a0I would have complained but it seems that other tables had the same looking very brown paella.The appetizers we good, we ordered the cod fritters and chicken croquettes. \u00a0 The location and service were good too.Not the place to go for paella.",
