    "My husband and I ate there on 10/19/15 for lunch. The food was just below average for a Barcelona tapas restaurant. The problem was that we received our chicken tapas and after the first bite realized that there were 3 perfectly placed beard or pubic hairs right on top of our food. It was obviously on accident. We had been very polite and there was no problem. Apparently they did not like seeing two married men dinning together and holding hands. They removed the dish from our check and the chef smoked outside while watching our table. We left immediately. It was a very, very disturbing episode to say the least. It tainted our entire trip to Barcelona.",
