    "Wow. We came here because it was rated so well, and were not disappointed. The Alhambra beer was delicious (and I don't normally like beer!), and the tapas was out of this world. Try the pigs trotter - a real delicacy and amazingly soft but full of flavour. The Iberican sausage was so much better than anything you get in the UK. Worth every cent - a firm favourite!",
