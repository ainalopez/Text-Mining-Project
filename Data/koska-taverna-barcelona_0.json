    "I got this place recommended by one of the locals on my current visit to Barcelona. I asked specifically for tapas places and He wrote a couple of places down on a piece of paper. He used a whole page to describe this place while he jammed the other places on the other side of the paper. Some of the words he used to describe this place was; \"not touristy\", \"best tapas\" and \"delicious\".. And they were all true.. This place is hidden, and when you enter you are certain that only locals are here to enjoy their late dinner . We were six non local people asking for a table. The waiter was friendly and guided us and presented the menu. The best part is that he was honest and explained what comes on a daily basis (fresh goods) and what is \"standard\" menu.. I looked through the menu, and hey - what do you know? 90% of the menu was glutenfree.. Not only did they mark underneath each tapas dish that it was glutenfree but also what tapas was vegetarian. We were a party of seven people so we ordered different tapas. The cow cheeks was really good, the meat was so tender that it almost melted in the mouth. The tuna tartar was to die for, but my favorite was the spinach dip served with nachos, I could not get enough.. We ended up paying 20euros each for two rounds of different tapas and drinks, so cheap! Great place, great price, great food! Enjoy!",
