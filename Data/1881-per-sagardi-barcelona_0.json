    "My visit to 1881 per sagardi was in the course of a private event, so I cannot say anything about the standard menu. When I entered the restaurant on the upper flor of the museum, I was greeted by friendly staff and a modern, simple but warm knterior. We were served drinks on the terrace, which overlooks the Barcelona prommenade. For dinner we were seated outside on the terrace, in an area that was shieldet from wind and rain by a sunroof that was opened and closed depending on the weather.We were served excellent wine, and a menu consisting of delicious tapas, a supreme duck confit and to top it off a crema catalana for desert. I can only recommend this place for private events, it is very special!",
