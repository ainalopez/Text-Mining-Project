    "This restaurant came highly recommended from a local friend of a friend. \u00a0The location is right off the water and you can watch people stroll by from the patio. \u00a0The place was not busy at all (which I personally think says a lot for a Barcelona restaurant). \u00a0Service was slow, but I came to get accustomed to that in Spain. \u00a0Atmosphere was relaxed.My husband loved the croquettes, I thought they were average. \u00a0I ordered the Scampi thinking that I was getting a pasta dish with cooked unshelled shrimp, I would be wrong my friends. \u00a0They were four prawns with eyeballs and everything intact. \u00a0Is was worth a good laugh, and my poor husband ended up eating them while I ate his meal.My two cents: \u00a0Average for Barcelona. \u00a0Nothing special.",
