    "Groups not welcomed outside. Rude waiters. A party of 7 (family incl. a child), we sat down outside around two tables. At first we were notified we couldn't use two tables. OK fair enough. Then another waiter came and told us they wouldn't serve a party of 8 (sic). After being ignored for a while we confronted a waiter who first explained in English we had to move our party inside to be served, and then pretented not to speak English.N'accepte pas les groupes de plus de 2 personnes.",
