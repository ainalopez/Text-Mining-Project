    "What a random find! We were wondering around the streets of Barcelona and it was our first time there visiting. WE were hungry and most restaurants were closing for their midday break but Milk was open. At the time they were serving \"Brunch\" still so we ordered from the brunch menu. I got the breakfast burger which had brie, bacon, honey and arugula. The best burger I had ever had! I still have dreams about it! The next couple of night we tried other places but it never compared to Milk. So on our last night in Barcelona we went back and had dinner at Milk. The dinner menu had more option and the food was excellent. This place is a small place but everyone is friendly and it's a warm place. I would definitely come back. We also tried their sister restaurant Marmalade which was equally as good",
