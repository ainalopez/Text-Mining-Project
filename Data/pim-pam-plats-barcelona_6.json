    "Found this place as we were walking through the area and instantly liked the feel of the place! Kind of had a university burger dive vibe...burger (the burger completa with the fried egg and bacon) was tasty. French fries were hot and also tasty. Though we didn't try the others, the selection looked great. Great for take out!!",
