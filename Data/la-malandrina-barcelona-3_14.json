    "I've been meaning to review this place forever, but I could never remember the name by the time I got back to my computer. \u00a0We all call it, affectionately, Cheapo-Steako. \u00a0This place does one thing and does it well, big ole slabs of steak. \u00a0Well, I have to assume. \u00a0I don't eat meat, but I know that getting a big ole slab of steak with a huge side of creamed potatoes and a beer or wine for under 8\u20ac is a great deal.I usually order a salad and a plate of creamed potatoes. \u00a0The salad is all of okay, mostly iceberg lettuce and corn, but the potatoes are amazing and the condiments for the bread really make it all worth while. \u00a0Over about the dozen times I've been there my companions have rated the steak from pretty good value to one of the best steaks in Barcelona. \u00a0So I guess the quality of the meat varies.The staff at La Malandrina are quite warm and charming. \u00a0They've even taken scraps from bused plates to save for my little dog. \u00a0You will be expected to eat and go--not very Spanish--but they are nice about it and it can be understandable as there is usually a line waiting to get inside.",
