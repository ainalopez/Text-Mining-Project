    "CANCELLED our booking!!-we had booked Abac 2-3 months early for a 40th birthday dinner to end a 72 hr trip to Barcelona from the U.S. On the day of the meal, we received confirmatory emails from tripadvisor and thefork.com only to learn from the restaurant that they had cancelled our reservation because we had not responded to an email request to confirm. We have no such email from Abac. Not an email warning us that we would later have to confirm our booking. Nothing at all. When presented with this, Abac mgmt did not even apologize nor try to make it right it any way. Just stunning and tone-deaf on their part. Had customers cancelled at the last moment, their credit cards would have been charged. Disappointing way to end an otherwise lovely trip. Probably needed the table for a VIP and shamelessly floated a lie to make room.",
