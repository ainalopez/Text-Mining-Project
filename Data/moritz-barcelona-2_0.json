    "This place is reaaally nice. They have a big store with items related to beer, a large bar and restaurant and it actually is the Moritz factory. The beer is great (duh) and the tapas are also really good.On sundays you can get 2 for 1 beers if you also visit CCCB. Perfect Sunday afternoon plan (;",
