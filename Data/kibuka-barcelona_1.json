    "I've had lunch here and would probably consider it my favourite Japanese lunch in Barcelona. As other reviews have mentioned, good quality Asian food is very hard to find in Spain. As such, I think this place is awesome-- but if you've been to Japan, you can easily point out the flaws in cooking authenticity. The price for lunch and amount of food they give you are both awesome. Any lunch that's 15 or under is great in my book, but a lunch at that price that is so large you might have to take it to go? Well, that's a real winner. I had the wakame salad, california roll, vegetable tempura, and matcha green tea. I had a sapporo beer as well, though that was an extra euro. I thought my salad was weirdly amazing, and the california roll was surprisingly fresh. A bit soft- I think slightly crunchier cucumber could have helped. Vegetable tempura was not greasy, but a bit heavy and the main sign of unauthentic Japanese cooking. In my experience, this is one of the hardest things to find done correctly outside of Asia, though. Would definitely return; and if you go, I recommend that you sit at the bar! Watching the chefs make the sushi is super fun! Also, be there early or late- the queue for this place was out the door at standard lunchtime!",
