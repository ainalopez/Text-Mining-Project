    "Amazing vegan restaurant.. We were in Barcelona for 4 nights and we were hooked once we had dinner here once! Being vegetarians, it was pretty hard to find a good options for dinner close to Las Ramblas, so we were pretty excited when our conceirge told us about this place. Their ingredients are fresh, service is good and the food is just lip smacking delicious! I believe their menu changes based on the season but when we went in February, they were serving lasagna and mini-sliders which i highly recommend!",
