    "We ate at La Pepita for dinner out first night in Barcelona... in part because of the great reviews we saw on Yelp.The tapas were great. \u00a0My friend and I shared 4 of them. \u00a0Our favorite was an Argentinian Beef... but they were all good.Our waiter suggested that we get 3-4 tapas and then each get one Pepita (sandwich type thing) \u00a0My Pepita had serano ham and cheese and a few other things on it. \u00a0It was just ok.If i were to go back I'd just get tapas. \u00a0OVerall it was a good meal, but not our favorite!",
