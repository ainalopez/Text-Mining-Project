    "Very pleased with this place! Cool looking restaurant-bar with a lovely outdoor seating area. Service was rapid and friendly, with equally rapidly served food. Went here as part of a tapas route with some friends and this was our favourite place by far. Ingredients were fresh and seasoned well, and had excellent textural balance. I'm not sure if they serve their \"Tennessee\"(an open faced sandwich that will make every roasted meat lover smile) regularly, but regardless, I am eager to return to try more of their menu!",
