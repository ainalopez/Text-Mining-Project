    "Had a bit of a rough start to our dinner here, but the owners went above and beyond to correct the mistakes. My boyfriend had one of the hot dogs and I had the quesadillas. You can tell everything is prepared with love and has a delicious southern comfort, street food quality to it. I had a lovely chat with the woman who owns it (who shares my love of Sperrys) and I'm excited for the future of this establishment. I'll definitely visit again when I'm in Barcelona.",
