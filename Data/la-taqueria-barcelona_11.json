    "Been trying to go here for a while, so we finally ended up here for lunch right when they opened at 1pm. We ordered the chicken tacos for my son, the arrachera especial and the cucarito tacos for myself. My tacos were supposed to be spicy, so I was warned, but I'd say they were mild at best. Still tasty but was looking for a little more fire. We had the Mexican mojito and the regular lime margarita. Skip the lime margarita and go for the mojito! Overall the food was good BUT the service really lacked. We were the only customers there and it took him quite a while to take our order and then to get the check. \u00a0I was looking to love this place, especially since it's so close to our place AND they have delivery service. \u00a0But I'd say skip it and head to Gracia to MEXCALA this place actually has sopes!",
