    "We went there with a group of 10 of us that had been in Spain for 2 weeks and badly needed something other than tapas for dinner. \u00a0Everything was excellent and this ended up being one of the best meals we had in Spain.They had real local foods with great flavours. Our group ordered a wide variety foods that were all good in their own way. \u00a0Chicken, steak, pizza, mixed grill all got high reviews. \u00a0the wild boar stew had incredible flavour but the meat was a bit dry and there was too little of it, House wine was very good. \u00a0Note that it only opens for dinner at 9pm. \u00a0There was a line outside when we got there so we were glad we had a reservation but it is a big place so they accommodated everyone.Highly recommended. Pricing was very reasonable. It came to under 25euros per person for us including lots of wine and dessert.",
