    "This place is unbelievable. It seems to always have a queue, but just put your name on the list and grab a drink somewhere else while you wait; it's worth it! Mosquito has an incredible assortment of things on the menu-- but not overwhelmingly so! It's is one of those places where you mark down the things you want to order. Also, they have Catalan, Chinese, and English menus which were great for our mixed group. The artisanal beers are also really excellent. \u00a0The roast duck (number 2) was some of the best duck I've ever had. In fact, the only ducks I could compare it to are the street food ducks I've had in Vietnam-- so basically, incredible tender and spot on flavours. The steamed belly pork was incredibly fatty, but in the best possible way. Our table had vegetable, pork, and beef dim sum-- and I think the pork and vegetable were particularly tasty. It should be noted that they have fried, boiled, and steamed dim sum, as well as more bun-type dim sum! The cucumber ajat was also so pleasantly refreshing! Overall, a few things had slightly overly salted sauces-- but I'm definitely nitpicking here. The whole experience was amazing and I can't wait to return.8 dishes and 3 beers came to 45 euros. Go with 1-3 others and share everything-- you won't regret it!",
