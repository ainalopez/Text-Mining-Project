    "This place is decent. My husband and I decided to try this place out since it is the sister restaurant of MILK in the Barri Gothic district. We had such a great experience at MILK that we thought this place would be just as good.Let me start by saying, because of the location, this restaurant is a few euros more than MILK itself although they both have the SAME EXACT menu. We went to brunch here and was disappointed when they handed us the same menu we saw. The atmosphere was more of a sports bar than at MILK where it was a small dive cozy restaurant. They had a pool table on the left, TVs to watch at the bar and loud music playing in the restaurant.The food was decent. I ordered the same Ranchera omelette i had before and it came out dry, and the potatoes weren't cooked all the way so it was partially hard. Husband and I had 2 cafe con leche 2 ranchera omelette with a water and it came out to be 37 euros.",
