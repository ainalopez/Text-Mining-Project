    "Bad English translation on the menu is cute. \u00a0Kinda sad, considering that they are catering to the Anglophiles coming through the city... but, this is a food review.This bright, sunny, and charmingly informal dining room really lends itself to the whole breakfast/brunch/lunch concept. \u00a0The bakery case has a tantalizing selection of sinful treats, including stuffed donuts (as I've seen at Donut Friend in Highland Park, CA - though it's not build-your-own). \u00a0As for the food: \u00a0The presentation is very nice, with colorful salads accompanying the sandwiches and eggs Benedict, which is what I ordered. \u00a0I'm not sure about the Eggs Benedict on a Hot Dog?? but I did have the Benedict on waffle. \u00a0I don't think English Muffins are available here in BCN. \u00a0While I found the food delicious, it was a bit heavy, and I felt kinda ill the rest of the day. \u00a0Service - well, we were a table of forceful American expats who have been living here for a combined 10 years. \u00a0Had we not waved down the server, we would have been neglected and ignored. \u00a0Ironic because the \"note\" (in bad English) on the menus said that they get very bussy [sic], and want us to help turn the table over. \u00a0It's their own fault that the tables don't get turned over. \u00a0Better than most places. \u00a03.5 reallly. \u00a0Had I not felt sick the rest of the day, I'd have given this a 4.",
