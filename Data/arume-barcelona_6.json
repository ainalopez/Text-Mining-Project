    "Amazing service, excellent food, efficient turnaround time!We walked in around 8pm on a Saturday and they just managed to squeeze us in between reservations (seems like you might need it if you showed up any later). Black berry mojito was perfect and sweet to my liking. We got a bottle of water to share for the table. You get bread, olive oil in a cute little tube and olives to start for free!We specifically went here for the rave paella reviews. My parent loved the duck paella and seafood paella, though they particularly loved the duck depth of flavors. The paella is generous, you will be studded if you finish one.Veggie perspective- they have one option for entrees- I did the pumpkin lasagna with an egg on top and I loved it. Great flavors and very filling.We got some complimentary Spanish creamy drink to end- kinda like baileys, but it was the icing on the cake!Would definitely come back.Yelpers- be careful when walking on the small streets to get to this place, a guy tried to grab my dads wallet in his back pocket on Carme street. Walk fast and keep your belongings on view- do not talk to anyone.",
