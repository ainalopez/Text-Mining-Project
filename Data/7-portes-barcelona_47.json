    "If you are looking for historic and traditional cuisine, you have found your spot. The restaurant is almost 200 years old and the doodles and signatures of famous visitors are displayed all around the room. We are at the same table as the President of Spain. I went with my team, representing individuals from four continents. The sampler of tapas with extra jamon was the way to go. Their sangria was terrific- well worth ordering. Finally, the paella... We got the vegetarian. It was excellent and I can only imagine all of the different types would be fantastic.Definitely make this a place you visit in Spain!",
