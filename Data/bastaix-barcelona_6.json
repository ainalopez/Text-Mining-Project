    "My boyfriend and I LOVE Bastaix! We were in Spain this past week and stumbled upon this little gem hidden in a nook in El Born. It's very chill and unassuming, and has such great vibes. The people who work here are very welcoming and nice, the food? Even better. We had 5 nights in Barcelona and we liked Bastaix so much, we went back a second time. We had (both times), the olives, manchego, pan con tomate (you make it yourself which seems weird at first, but it's actually awesome!), one of the meat plates (I think Iberian Jamon), and two of the warm toasts: the warm brie one (our favorite!) and the one with anchovies and roasted red peppers. The sangria and Rioja are awesome! Seriously love this place, can't recommend it enough!",
