    "It's a weird bar. If you are a beer lover and you want to choose among a well-curated 200+ beer collection, at reasonable price, this is your spot. But don't expect a nice place to stay at - there are only 3-5 seats in the bar, no music and a very silent owner. The other option is to go enjoy your beer outside, on the sidewalk. Not the best experience, even though we would have loved to discover more beers here.",
