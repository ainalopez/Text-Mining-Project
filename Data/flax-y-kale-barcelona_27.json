    "This is a beautiful restaurant and I loved the ambience. With friends (one whom is a vegan and the other a vegetarian) I tried the tacos and lasagna- both were delicious! On a second visit I came alone and had the salmon toast which was a perfect healthy and light dish that I needed! Definitely would come back, however be aware that it is pretty pricey!!",
