    "We lucked out getting two seats as we walked up to the bar, im not sure I would have waited too long because it just doesnt seem necessary when there are so many good places, just move on you know. \u00a0Anyways we did luck out and sat down immediately at lunch. \u00a0We ordered items that were recommended such as the artichoke fries, which we did not enjoy they were just too greasy I would skip these. \u00a0We also ordered the grilled baby squid, this was really good but sooo salty. \u00a0Our favorite by far were the mussels in white wine, they were cooked perfectly and were such good quality mussels but again quite salty. \u00a0We enjoyed eating here but I dont think it was the best and would not return again.",
