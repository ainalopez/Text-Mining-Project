    "Oviso's is perfect for a drink surrounded by locals in a touristy area. Just next to Bar Lisa, the sign for Oviso's is subdued, but the atmosphere inside is hipster-grunge. I usually order sangria, and it never disappoints. Staff are super friendly and will go out of their way to make sure you are happy. I've been coming here for about 4 years and always leave satisfied!",
