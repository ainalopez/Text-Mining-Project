    "Long wait and no... Unlike the other places in Barcelona... The lines do not move quickly. Be prepared to sit at the entrance for awhile. We came around 3pm. We should've ordered separate dishes, but we got the combos. The salad was great! The caesar dressing had a lemony tang. The main courses were just okay. I ordered a cannolini. The cannolini had aioli on top and the middle was stuffed with a potato filling.Beet pasta was... Bland and gross. I added pepper and still didn't help. There were small pieces of tofu, olives and cheese but it barely helped the blandness of the pasta. Even a few pieces of sun dried tomato would've helped. There was a guy sitting across from us and he was shaking salt all over his pasta. Andddd although it was a beet pasta I tasted no beet flavoring. Just made our pasta pinkish/purplish.Maybe they like eating their pastas with no sauce?!?Lesson learned......order separate dishes. Do not do the meal pairings. Their weekly \"specials\" aren't that special.",
