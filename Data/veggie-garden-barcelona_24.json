    "I was nervous about straying from Gopal (which I am familiar with and love) in order to try out another restaurant that may disappoint me. \u00a0Fortunately, I really liked my dinner at Veggie Garden. I read the daily menu was a bargain, but I was still surprised by just how much food I got for the price. \u00a0Everything we had was good, with the exception of dessert. \u00a0I liked my cake, but the chocolate mousse was just... weird. \u00a0It tasted fruity and not at all like chocolate. I would still definitely go back for the good value, satisfying food, and friendly service.",
