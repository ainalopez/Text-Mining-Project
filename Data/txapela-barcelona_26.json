    "Ok, I'll start with the fact that this place is super touristy...I mean, it's on Passeig de Gracia for God's sake. But whatever, it's not bad. Prices are reasonable, the pintxos were pretty good, the wine was aplenty and the placemats have a name/photo guide so you know exactly what you're ordering. Can't beat that - and can't knock this joint for a quick snack and drink while touring.",
