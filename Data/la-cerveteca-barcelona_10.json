    "Great little bar with an immense number of different beers. My friends said it is owned by some Belgians. The number and quality of the drinks on offer is second to none. In the bar you can buy a beer at the bar and then spend your time choosing which of the bottles on the shelves to take home with you. A good place to meet people for pre-drinks.",
