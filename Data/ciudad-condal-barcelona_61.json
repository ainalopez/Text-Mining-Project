    "I call it 'The sister of Cervezaria Catalana'Its a bit less crazy crowded than its sister restaurant :) Well, depending of the day and hour of course. But at least at this place I was able to sit more often and to get the same quality of food with small exceptions.Its closer to Placa Catalunya, so if you are in the area and see some chance for a seat, grab it! :)They have a bit bigger terrace than Cervezaria Catalana exactly on Rambla de Catalunya so its nice to dine there and watch all the people and the life around.",
