    "Understand two things:1) I was raised on Donut Man donuts (in other words, I so-humbly consider myself a connoisseur)2) I don't have a sweet tooth. I have about 20.APPARENTLY Spain is less crazy about eating anything too sweet, going out to eat in general, overeating, etc. So I was quite thrilled to find this little Greek gem to satiate my American-sized appetite. Grab a little chocolate donut or jelly-filled one. One covered in powdered sugar or coconut flakes. How about them NUTELLA-filled donuts? Grab about 5 of those. If none of those sound appealing, opt for one of the many options: chocolate/strawberry-filled, glazed, lemon, etc. There's something for everyone. It's very new, modern, and clean in comparison to many of the old and maintained bars and cafes in its historical neighborhood, Gracia. The art and decor changes once in a while, and the man who runs the place is very nice. If you don't speak Spanish or Catalan, just point and nod and pay and it should work as if you do!If you're visiting the city, grab some donuts on your way to Parc G\u00fcell and enjoy them with the views of beautiful Barcelona. One of my favorite spots when I lived there!",
