    "Great new restaurant in Barcelona. The vibe's relaxed and cool (but not over the top), there's a fair few wines by the glass, the tapas are creatively put together and delicious (a squid and wild mushroom concoction particularly stood out). Oh, and there's a cheese plate to die for. If I had to pick fault with one thing, I'd say that one of the (very friendly) waiters had to be prompted a couple of times about bringing some bread. But it's early days, so these things should definitely be ironed out. Otherwise, loved it.",
