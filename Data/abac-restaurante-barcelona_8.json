    "Great dinner experience. Did the tasting menu. Found the food/presentation to be very creative and delicious. Thought there was a little drop off in the desserts but overall, the best meal I had on this trip to Spain. Note that if you do order bottled water with your meal, they will automatically pop open a new bottle and keep topping up your cup.",
