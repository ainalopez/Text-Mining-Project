    "Conveniently located across the train station, but do yourself a favor and walk a little further to the many fine restaurants in this area. \u00a0Food here is sub-standard. \u00a0Both the paella and the mixed tapas we ordered were inedible. After an 18 trip across the ocean, our first meal in Barcelona was an absolute disappointment. \u00a060 euro out the door. Ugh.",
