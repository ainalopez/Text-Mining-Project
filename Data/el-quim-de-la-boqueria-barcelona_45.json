    "I had read a lot about this place but never actually went to it during my many visits to Barcelona. This time though, while wandering around la boqueria, there was magically a seat open next to a nice old Spanish man who kept telling me \"cuidado\" about pickpockets and suggested I hold tight to my camera.There were about 5 babely men working at the bar. I ordered a glass of red wine and some patatas bravas... And paid 6 euro total so I honestly have no complaints about the price.Service is good... The men working there are muy caliente... You get to sit and enjoy food and drink amongst the exciting hustle and bustle of la boqueria... Love this place!",
