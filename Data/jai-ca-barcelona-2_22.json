    "I'm definitely not a tapas expert, and I'm sure there are better places than this, but for the price this was pretty good. \u00a0Highlights: \u00a0langoustines (divine -- fresh, steaming hot and nicely flavored with olive oil and salt); octopus (very fresh and nice spice to it). \u00a0Weaknesses: \u00a0cod fritters (WAY too much batter, as in \"would you like some cod with your batter?\"). \u00a0Tuna/egg/olive salad was good, but oddly simple with not a lot of flavor.By 845pm or so it was definitely crowded.I would recommend.",
