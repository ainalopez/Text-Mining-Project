    "When traveling through Europe, there are many places people want to go see like; statues, museums, parks, seas, and other total tourist destinations. Well, I on the other hand would never recommend seeing such places with out eating the proper meal. Which brings me to my Next point. 7 Portes! It was probably one of the better restaurants I had been to in years that had such an authentic feel and so much history behind every single item in the restaurant. The previous reviews are correct! The Paella is amazing, the mussels haven't gotten enough credit and the rabbit and chicken broth appetizer is unique yet succulent on your pallets! Wine is delicious.Also, some tid bits about the restaurant itself. Its almost 175 years old and all the tables have little plaques to tell you who else has sat at the table. I sat where Robert Di'nero sat.All and all, this place is a must!",
