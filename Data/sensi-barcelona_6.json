    "We order six tapas platters between the two of us. I suggest get 4 or five if you would like desert. The sangrias were amazing and every dish we got was absolutely outstanding! Would definitely go back for cocktails and the hot waiter;) Also I strongly suggest getting the cheese platter! Keep in mind the bread is not free.",
