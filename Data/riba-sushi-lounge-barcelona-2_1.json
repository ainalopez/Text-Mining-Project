    "Just dropped by there for lunch and the menu they had was great. I had vegetarian Sushi as my first course and noodles with vegetables as my second one. A nice warm brownie for dessert and a baverage was included as well. The atmosphere was a little dark for this nice summer day and unfortunately there was no outdoor seating. Price, food and service were great though and therefore I would go again for another lunch here.",
