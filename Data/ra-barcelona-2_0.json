    "Tired of all the same seafood based tapas and pizza spots available on every block in Barcelona, I did a little research to find something worth while. \u00a0Viola we found Ra! The meal here was really great. The portions were a little smaller than expected but everything was great. My boyfriend and I went for a late dinner and decided to share a few things. We decided on the chorizo naan, mixed ceviche, pork wrap and a brownie for dessert. Aside from the small portions, everything tasted delicious. The sangria was the best we have had in Barcelona and the service was excellent. I would recommend this delicious restaurant to anyone visiting the city!",
