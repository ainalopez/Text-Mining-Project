    "With all of the sandwiches sold in Barcelona, this one is the BEST. Unlike all the other places, this place PILES on the meat, vegetables, and sauces. Everything is made SUPER fresh, and there is always a line out the door. The bread they use on the sandwich is fresh, and alone is amazing. Piled on with all the fresh ingredients, nothing beats it. My friend ordered a salad there, which was HUGE. It was just as delicious as the sandwich, and came with a basket of bread on the side, so essentially it was the same thing as the sandwich, but in salad form. Still great! So much food for your money. They have their own unique way of doing things. They have their own unique way of seating you. If you say you want to dine in, they tell you to wait outside. Then they will serve some people. When they are ready for you, they will call you in to sit. Then they will serve some people. When they are ready for you to order, they just call you from across the counter and ask what you want. Friends that have been here many times have told me they always have a weird way of doing things--theres no I came first so I will get served and order first, they just go with their own flow and serve whoever they want whenever the boss feels like it. But either way, it's worth the wait and their kooky ways for this food!!!",
