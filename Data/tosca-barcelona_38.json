    "Sorry, but I'm feeling very led astray by you Yelpers. This place is nothing special. The food is very meh. Maybe I didn't order well, but everything I ordered was a disappointment. I had the mixed cheese/meat charcuterie plate (nothing had any flavor, and the cheese was served too cold), the salad with goat cheese, and the sausages in special sauce. It wasn't \"bad,\" and the restaurant itself was clean, with a good vibe and nice crowd. But the food was so boring, I just couldn't get through it. I pretty much always clean my plate, but couldn't manage that here. Not sure why all the glowing reviews? There's no way this is the best tapas in Barcelona. I've had far better in Boston.",
