    "This was always a go-to spot for out-of-town visitors because its expansive menu covering so many different cuisines and dietary needs made it easy for groups and for people interested in something a bit more familiar. The fact that's in the Santa Caterina market made it even more fun for visitors.Plan to get here early - they don't take reservations and you'll have to wait, but it's not too bad as you can get a glass of wine and some tapitas at the bar while waiting.The menu is a crowd pleaser, and the food is great. Service is not so great, I find that the waiters definitely step it up for the tourists hoping to get a tip and then ignore the other diners, but this has come to be par for the course in the neighborhood and whole Old City in general.Simply put - if you're visiting BCN, this is a great spot for both dinner and lunch right in the Ribera district next to the Cathedral square.",
