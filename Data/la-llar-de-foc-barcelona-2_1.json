    "In a Barri (neighborhood) of patas (potatoes), croquette & olive tapas, here's a restaurant with panache. Menu. Chef. Service & Wait(ress) who know their menu. Modestly priced dishes. The lasagna is a revelation... unlike ANY lasagna you have had. I had a quarter grilled rabbit (\u20ac 6,15) that was perfectly cooked. A gazpacho that, well was the best salad I ever drank. Well done & well worth the money in this maze of unspectacular hole in the wall Catalan & Castellano tapa bars. We've been to Gr\u00e0cia twice in two years and I can honestly say that I regret not finding la Llar de Foc. The Good news is we have 5 more days to eat there and that you should go to enjoy this eatery.",
