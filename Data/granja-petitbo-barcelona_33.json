    "Recommended to us by a local. Service was great, plenty of space and food was top notch. We tried the juices which were great. I got the salmon Benedict which compares to the better Benedicts I've had in Sf. The pancake was quite good but my wife ordered it and she liked it a bit too much to share with me.",
