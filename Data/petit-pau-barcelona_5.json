    "Cannot say enough positive things about this restaurant!! Started off greeted by the owner with complementary glass of cava. He then walks through the menu explaining each and every dish. The atmosphere is cozy, service is superb and food is incredible. The eggplant appetizer is bursting with flavor. The lamb main dish is one of the best I've had. A little out of the way but absolutely worth the trip. Make a reservation ahead of time (they seem to book up rather quickly)... You must go while in Barcelona, would not miss it!",
