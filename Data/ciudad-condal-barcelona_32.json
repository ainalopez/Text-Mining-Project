    "First off, this was the first restaurant we tried once we got off the plane. We were hungry, sleep deprived and didn't come with any expectations. At that time it felt like a 4 rating.After a full week of eating at various tapas restaurants, I would give this place 3.5 rating. Everything we ordered was good with the exception of baby clams which didn't taste very fresh. We had deep fried peppers and sardines and they were all standard and done well. By sitting at the bar our service was quick and attentive. It's not a place that I would go out of my way to go to, but their food doesn't disappoint. Btw, this place was filled with tourists.",
