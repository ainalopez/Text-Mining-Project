    "This place is NOT awesome as reviews everywhere suggest, so I assume people keep coming because it's one of the few Barcelona restaurants reviewed on Yelp. \u00a0It also has tons of reviews on TripAdvisor. \u00a0Everyone dining here was either American or speaking English, so that just backs my theory!We had the seafood and meat paella dishes, which were both pretty mushy. \u00a0The complimentary bread lightly brushed with a mild tomato sauce/olive oil mixture was okay though, so I ate more of that than our actual entrees.",
