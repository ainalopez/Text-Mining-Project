    "La Flauta is a must when you are in Barcelona. Specializing in well crafted, fresh Spanish tapas. The food is very reasonably priced and delicious. We had the patatas bravas and they were spectacular. I also recommend the asparagus and mushrooms. It's a little off the beaten path which makes it less touristy. The atmosphere is a little more upscale than a traditional tapas bar but the food matches that atmosphere. I would definitely recommend it.",
