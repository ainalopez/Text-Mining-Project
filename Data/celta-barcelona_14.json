    "This was the gastronomic highlight of my trip to Barcelona (trip on a budget). \u00a0Sit at the counter and order a pitcher of red sangria (or a bottle of something) and point at what you want. \u00a0The baby octopus is excellent, as are the adult octopus, but my favorite by far were the fried piquillo peppers -- a small crispy bundle with just the right amount of salt and just the right amount of heat. \u00a0Reasonably priced tapas in a tourist area are hard to find! \u00a0Dishes were in the 3-5 euro range (compared to 8-15 euro) at the other places that we checked out on Las Ramblas nearby.",
