    "Sometimes it is not what it looks, and this place is one of those. The name made me think I was going to find a beer heaven, but it's not. It seems that they have more wine choice than beer. I am a beer lover and I am still looking for the right place to have an IPA that is not going to cost me a leg. They only had one IPA and I also took a look to the menu and it was completely overprice. I have to mention that the service was perfect, nice and charming. They absolutely have better waiters than menu.",
