    "OMG this place is amazing! From the presentation to the taste, I love it all. I tried the Super Sandwich and, boy, was it good. It had a syringe filled with guacamole! How genius is that? It's was so great. We also got the cheesecake and it was served in a flower pot. How cute! The presentation of the food was amazing and so was the taste. The price is also great for the quality of food! Definitely coming back here. It's a great place to have brunch with friends.",
