    "Very creative, delicious,elegant. \u00a0Excellent service. \u00a0Only complaint is I don't like eating with my hands, which were the instructions for 2 dishes. \u00a0When I asked for utensils, I had to explain \"I prefer not to use my hands\" because they again said I should eat it by hand instead of them just obliging me.We got the larger menu. \u00a0They dealt well with lactose intolerance, and I didn't \u00a0feel cheated at all. \u00a0They have 2 head chefs, 1 Japanese and one Peruvian. It is clear they are working closely together to make the blending just right. \u00a0Ambiance is lovely. We also went to tickets ( same owner) which is more difficult to get a reservation. \u00a0If you can only do one, pick by menu as both are great. \u00a0The ambiance at pakta is more elegant and quiet. \u00a0Suggested starter cocktails were not a ploy to increase the bill. \u00a0Both our drinks were really yummy and creative flavors.",
