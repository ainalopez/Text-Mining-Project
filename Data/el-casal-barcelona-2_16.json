    "Simple, straight forward menu with good food. The tortilla was nice and had that \"home cooked\" feel that one craves when you're eating out all the time as a tourist. The waitstaff is really nice too. The neighborhood is quiet so you can relax and wake up as you sip on your coffee. This was the best breakfast place we found in Barcelona.",
