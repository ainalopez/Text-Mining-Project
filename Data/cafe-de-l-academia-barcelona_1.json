    "My husband and I went here for lunch, and it was rather disappointing, considering the positive reviews. The atmosphere was pretty, but the service and food were nothing special. I had an eggplant terrine and a cod/chickpea dish and neither were tasty enough to eat more than a couple of bites of. On top of that, the portions were really big, compared to all the delicately-portioned tapas we had been eating since we arrived here.",
