    "If you can, try and make it for the lunch deal which ends at 4:30 p.m. You can get a 3 course lunch for \u20ac9,90 with beer or wine which is an amazing deal. After 4:30 p.m. you can use the Yelp 15% off any plate check-in deal. I ordered the Margherita pizza (normally \u20ac8) and though it was a wide pizza it was quite thin as well. It was very tasty, though. A friend ordered one of the desserts and loved it. Pizzas range \u20ac8-11-ish.There is also a flyer which entitles you up to 20% discount on the menu. Be careful with the 'up to', though. You may get 10-20% depending on the item. Soft drinks are about \u20ac2 for a 330ml can. Desserts range from \u20ac4-6ish, but you can use the flyer 20% discount on them.",
