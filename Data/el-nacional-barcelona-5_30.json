    "Looks pretty but I didn't think this place has any soul, charm, or personality. Everything was expensive. I don't mind paying a little more if I get a unique experience in return but that wasn't the case here. Really expensive drinks. Not worth it.Probably caters to business men and tourists. I'm just not sure why a local would go here when Barcelona is full with great spots to dine and wine.",
