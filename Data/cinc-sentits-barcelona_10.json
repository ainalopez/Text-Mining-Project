    "I have been remiss in not reviewing my April dinner at this amazing restaurant. \u00a0We were visiting my sister in Barcelona and on our last night there, she took our kids to the skate park and sent my wife and I to Cinc Sentits.The meal was excellent - all seven+ courses. \u00a0They happily adapted the menu for my wife who is a vegetarian (but eats fish). \u00a0The servers did a great job of presenting the food and the wine pairings and why they worked together. \u00a0We chose the local wine menu to get the full spanish experience.You will not regret this experience.",
