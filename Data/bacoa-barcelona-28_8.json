    "If you spend the day in La Rambla, you might need to refuel on energy. \u00a0If so, get your tired butt and blistered feet to Kiosko!Kiosko is soooo good that you need to be prepared to wait in line. \u00a0Don't worry. \u00a0You have to fill out a form of what you want to order. \u00a0Kiosko has menus in English, Spanish and, I think if I recall right, German.I had a chicken burger and my fiance had a hamburger. \u00a0Man, I definitely wasn't expecting a huge burger but we weren't complaining. \u00a0Fries were good as well. \u00a0Overall, it was heavenly!Seating may be a challenge. \u00a0We got good seats. \u00a0However, there are some seats by the line which barely gives you any room to pull out the chair and dine. \u00a0I don't know what they were thinking unless they were trying to take advantage of having as many people in the building as possible.Overall, service was good as well as the food.",
