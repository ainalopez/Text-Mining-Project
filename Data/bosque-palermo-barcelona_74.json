    "Probably my least favorite of the Barcelona restaurants I visited. I don't like Seafood Paella that is not de-shelled, so ordered the meat paella. I eat shellfish, but not fish. Saw the mussels touching the slabs of fish and fish juices, so was not interested in the seafood paella. Sausage in it was a little funky to me. And seeing the animal hoof they cut the meat from was a little sickening for someone who's not used to it. The best part about this place was the crazy cheap bottles of wine. If you want to drink wine, come here. If you want to eat, go somewhere else.",
