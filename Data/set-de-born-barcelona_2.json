    "Thank goodness for an International data plan and Yelp!We were lost wandering about Barcelona after a day at the beach, really wanted to find some tapas, about ready to kill each other because we were so hangry - then my phone found this place...a Godsend! The service was good, they didn't speak the best English, but we all made it work. We ordered a big plate of jamon, cheese, olives, tomaquet, dried fruits, and cured meats and went to town on that and a couple bottles of wine.It was located in the gothic area of Barcelona also, so the architecture of the surrounding buildings was very cool. It was one of the most traditional Spanish meals we had in Barcelona.",
