    "First off don't think of this as a sushi restaurant. \u00a0While it does have nigiri, sashimi and rolls what really makes it nice are the other dishes on the menu.Second, you know it's going to be expensive when you can see almost as many people in the kitchen as there are customers.It's a beautiful place with an extremely open kitchen that is almost a stage.",
