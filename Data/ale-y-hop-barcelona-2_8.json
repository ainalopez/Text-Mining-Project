    "We found Ale & Hop while staying in the El Born neighborhood, and it was a great craft beer oasis to have nearby. It's a small spot on a cool cobblestone street with an outdoor area you can hang out in if you want to. They have a good selection of beers on tap both local and from far away, and you can get them in pints or half pints which is really cool so you can try more beers without having to get sloshed.We didn't try the food though, but from what I read they have some good selections also. In addition to the beers on tap, they have a selection of bottles/cans that you can buy to have there or take away also.Definitely I'd go back next time we're visiting Barcelona :-)",
