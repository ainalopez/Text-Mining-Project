    "Go here for dinner at least once in your time in Barcelona. This little gem was tucked away near the beach, had I known of it sooner I would have eaten there more. We showed up around 2200 with no reservations and a group of 4 on Friday night, they sat us immediately and were very friendly. After a few minutes of reviewing the menu board and coming to no solid starting point we asked what our waitress recommended and she looked at the menu and said everything, so we took her advice and ordered almost everything. Not one plate let us down. They pride themselves on being a farm to table locally sourced type of kitchen, they do not disappoint. From tempura fried zucchini flowers with goat cheese to steamed seafood medley to roasted wild mushrooms it was truly delicious. My group ate till it couldn't take anymore wine and food then we gladly said goodnight to the staff and wandered to the beach for an evening beach stroll. Most definitely will be returning as the seasonal menu will need another chance to make culinary magic.",
