    "Delicious. Stopped by in the afternoon and discovered it was only open for dinner. Came here on recommendation from a friend and it didn't disappoint. I still can't believe the drinks prices all over Spain. 4\u20ac mojitos and 3\u20ac glasses of wine. Tried a few different tapas. The Argentine beef skewer and roasted artichokes stood out the most. The beef skewer was so tender. Also, the chicken croquettes were a welcome change from all the jam\u00f3n croquettes I had been eating. The sauce it came with was great! Definitely would suggest trying this place out! Bring a pen/marker to sign the walls/windows after dinner.",
