    "This place is amazing! I spent a week in Barcelona and was lucky enough to discover this place on my first night. My friend and I ate there 5 out of 6 nights! The pizza is incredible, thin, crispy, flavorful, with fresh ingredients. The burrata is to die for! I loved the customer service, everyone is so friendly and attentive. My wine and water glasses were never empty. By our last night, I knew I was going to miss this place. We tried almost every pizza and the entire red wine list. You can not make a bad choice! I can't wait to go back.",
