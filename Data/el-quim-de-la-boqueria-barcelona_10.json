    "This is an absolute must if you go to Barcelona. \u00a0The market which this food stand is located is a great place to visit but my destination is El Quim. \u00a0It's like getting high end food in a food stall. \u00a0The two dishes that really stood out were the wild mushrooms topped with a fried egg and seared foie gras, and steak topped with black truffles. \u00a0Amazing taste and cooked perfectly. \u00a0Getting a seat is a bit challenging but if you hover and order a drink while you wait, the staff usually will help you claim a seat. \u00a0The food is really good and the staff is friendly.",
