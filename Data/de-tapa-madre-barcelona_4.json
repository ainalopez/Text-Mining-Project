    "We ate here twice during our stay in Barcelona. Once for tapas, which were delicious, the second time for paella. Had to wait 20 minutes, but that's how we could tell it was the real deal (several places in the area serve reheated from frozen), and was it ever worth the wait! Definitely recommend.",
