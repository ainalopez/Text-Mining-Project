    "This was my favorite tapas restaurant during our stay in Barcelona. The location is right in the center of my favorite neighborhood, El Born. This area is packed with plenty of bars and restaurants, and El Xampanyet truly stands out. To tell you how well liked this place is, I have to explain that we had to return a second night to get in. Starting right when they open for dinner service at 7, there is already a line of people waiting to get seated. We decided to pass on the first night because we were just too hungry to wait, but we returned early enough to snag a table at opening on our second try. They even have a standing room only bar where you can grab a quick drink and plate on the go. Every dish we tried was stellar! My personal favorite was the anchovies and their house wine that comes in bottles. Service was amazing despite the rush crowd and it was fun to see the preparation of food in the front bar area. I also loved that they rang a bell and cheered when tables left a tip. Great energy overall!The mixture of locals here really made me realize that El Xampanyet is the real deal. This truly topped my list for my trip and I would highly recommend.",
