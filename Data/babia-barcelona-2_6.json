    "Fantastic little tapas bar somewhere in the backstreets of Barcelona's gothic quarter. Smoky, busy and noisy and managing to maintain a local feel lost in most of the establishments in the area. Search it out, grab a seat at the bar, some Iberico ham to nibble on and some cervezas to drink and enjoy.",
