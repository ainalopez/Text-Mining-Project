    "Great Japanese food in Barcelona. \u00a0Wonderful miso soup, fantastic chawanmushi. Nigiri sushi is very good, but we're spoiled since we live in San Diego and have access to great sushi. \u00a0Spicy tuna roll was excellent and with more varied flavors than we're used to in SD. \u00a0Full of locals when we went. \u00a0Prices were very fair. \u00a0Would go again.",
