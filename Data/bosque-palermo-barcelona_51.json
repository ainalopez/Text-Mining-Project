    "Honestly, delicious carne paella. The only thing that stopped this place from having completely five stars is the slowness in service. Maybe I am not used to the slow service but the workers were really sweet as one of the waiters let me charge my phone in the restaurant. Keep in mind it takes 30-40 minutes for them to make the paella when you order it. It's definitely fresh and tasty, but a rather time consuming visit. So if you are short on time, I wouldn't recommend going here. But if you would like a nice and sweet and intimate setting with a genuine experience of paella, please stop by!",
