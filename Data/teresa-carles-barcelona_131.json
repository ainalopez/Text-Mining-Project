    "I went to this restaurant last night with 3 other people last night and was simply not impressed. There was an hour wait (which I expected) at 9:30 on a Sunday night. When we got seated they did have English menus and English speaking staff which made it easier for us to order. We got sat at a large table with the menus given to us but then we were ignored for 10 minutes (at least get us a drink!). Food was good... Probably a 3.5/5. \u00a0Prices were a little steep but not crazy. For me the food just wasn't mind blowing. \u00a0Maybe coming from the northeast of the States is the reason why I'm not as happy as others are. While traveling through Spain and Portugal it's been nearly impossible to find a plate with mostly vegetables or even a decent salad. So I was excited to come here as my wife is a vegetarian and I just love creative dishes. \u00a0Where I come from there are restaurants that serve strictly vegetarian food who could wipe the floor with this place.",
