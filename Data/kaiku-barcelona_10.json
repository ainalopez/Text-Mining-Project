    "The food here was incredible. The razor clams, red prawns, and their non-paella yet paella esque rice platters are all highly recommendable. Their wine was a little too pricey and the service, initially, was a little brusque, but our waitress warmed up to us after the restaurant got a little less busy. Note: their Yelp location is completely wrong. The restaurant is located at the very end of the Barcelonita peninsula where Calle del Mar meets Plaza del Mar. It's NOT right off Calle Ginebra like Yelp's map suggests.",
