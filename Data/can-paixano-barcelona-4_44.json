    "If you want as local a spot as it gets you MUST stop hereWhile I was studying abroad and on a tight budget this place truly took my Euro for eats and drinks a loooong way, as there was nothing more expensive than 6E on the menu. Best of all, everything is served with their incredible house made cava so if your looking to start a long evening out this is the place to be. A wide array of Spanish meats/cheese's/sandwiches/tapas can accommodate a large variety of tastes and preferences. Few of my suggestions:1-chorizo platter (get like 10 of these)2-bacon burger3-jamon platter......to name a fewPlace is a bit difficult to find as its off the beaten path, but you'll know when you see it usually by the line outside the door. Standing room & cash only contributes to the authenticity of the atmosphere but can be trying sometimes when it is busy and difficult to order!Easily one of my favorite places in BCN, if you dont eat here while visiting your doing it wrong!",
