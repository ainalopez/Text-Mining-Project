    "Place was delicious. I found this place on Yelp, a tiny hole in the wall in Barrio Gothico. We walked in and were confused and tried to go to the dining room in the back, the lady behind the front counter kindly told us we have to order up front and pay and then find our seat in the back.It was the best pasta/ravioli I have ever had, and I am from New York. One entree, bread, any drink (beer, wine or cola) is included. For two dinners it cost us 18 euro. The place is quite small, cozy, elegant, music playing, kitchen right near the tables. There is only a hostess/cashier and a couple of cooks. We went around 7pm on a Saturday and there was only one other couple. The lady spoke fine English and passionately went through the menu with us and recommended a bunch of things. However, I just think this is a common, tourista place to eat. The first thing she asked us was if we found this place on Yelp, haha. I am here for about another week and will definitely go back. We left stuffed!",
