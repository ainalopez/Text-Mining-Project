    "Convenient location near the Barcelona Cathedral for lunch while sight-seeing. Is a pintxo bar (basque-style) although has much more seating than the other pintxo bars we tried, which is good after a morning of walking around town. Very crowded though, so not great for big groups. Decor is more modern than other pintxo bars as well, where weathered \u00a0wood is the dominant motif.Can't tell you what I had though (the one problem of pintxo bars since you don't have to order, you don't really know exactly what you are eating ... my daughter has a nut allergy so we had to constantly ask if an item had nuts in it which is not something I learned in college Spanish, but I'm quite proficient now. But the dishes were more hit and miss than Irati or Euskal Etxea. Stick with items that are served on bread. And the servers were not very friendly.",
