    "I found this place right as we were entering La Boqueria. We sat ourselves at the counter where we were able to watch the chefs at work. The server took a while to bring us our menus but the food came out rather quickly after we ordered.We had the cured meats with manchengo cheese, the brava patatas, and their special of the day which was seared scallops. The potatoes were good and had an interesting spice to them which we couldn't figure out. They were topped with an aioli froth which made the dish extra yummy. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were served over a delicious pur\u00e9e of what seemed to be cauliflower. The wines we had were very good. Overall, it was a decent place for our first tapas experience in Barcelona but I am certain we will find better and cheaper spots. Service could've been a little better but their food made up for it.",
