    "The place looked very nice from the street, many tables outside were busy, I was hungry, so it was easy to make a choice to have a meal here. What a mistake. Should have read Yelp reviews first! Wine was good, five starts - i tried the local white. The food ( at least my unfortunate choice) was very bad and over priced. The mixed salad ( i think it is called baby something with sprouts) at \u20ac10.60. It is just a mixed salad,nice and fresh but very dry - i could not taste any dressing, quite small portion. The waiter brought olive oil to my table but when i said i dont want bread , he took it away. Apparently, oil was for bread, not for the salad. Anyway, my table didnt have any of the essentials - salt, pepper, oil, vinegar. I guess one need to ask as no one offers. I was served a little plate of olives which were very tasty but i didnt order them, so i thought these were complimentary. Apparently not. I later saw the charge on my bill, thus, automatically down to two starts. I dont like when the restaurant decides what to order and what to put on my bill without even asking me. I suspect they do the same with bread. My main course was the Sunday special - monkfish stew. Terrible. Tiny portion even though i ordered it as a full plate for \u20ac24. Very salty and crayfish (or prawns?) \u00a0was almost raw which i dont like either. It was my first meal in Barcelona and it was quite a disappointment. \u00a0I think it can be a good place for a glass of wine and small appetizers. \u00a0A table next to mine ordered mussels and little fried fish which look much better then my meal.",
