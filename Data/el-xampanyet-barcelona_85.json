    "This gets incredibly busy at night with people spilling over on the street. Inside is pretty small but there are some tables to sit down. If you arrive late prepare to stand for sure. The tapas are pretty good and they have over 32 varieties of cava! We stayed here so long that we closed the bar with the owners who are two older gentelmen but don't let them fool you, they have so much energy! A must to visit if in Barcelona!",
