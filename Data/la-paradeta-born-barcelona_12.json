    "The best seafood restaurant I've been to in a long time!Be prepared to wait, for a long time. \u00a0No resies and long lines any time of day.All the catch is laid out in the front. \u00a0Walk in and order by weight, tell them how you want it cooked (some items you get a couple of options). \u00a0They will rush you a little given there's 20 hungry people standing behind you, and maybe not speak the best English but trust me the food is well worth it!Alcohol is by bottle only. \u00a0Some of the bottle are pretty small so no problem there. \u00a0We got cava or what I'm told the local drink of choice - can't go wrong there.Pay then wait with your number. \u00a0They will call you up to a little window when each item is done and cross it off your receipt.You get a choice of sauces (not complimentary!). \u00a0Garlic sauce is the best.In order of yumminess:Razor clams omfg! So incredibly delicious we had to get seconds (I only regret not getting thirds). \u00a0Fresh and clean tasting (I've had them in other countries where they tasted like chemicals :( ).Shrimp with claws! \u00a0Cross between lobster and shrimp. \u00a0So tasty!Shrimp - there's two diff kinds - we got the uncooked - larger and more pricey but deliciously grilled. \u00a0Cockles - really fresh and juicy.Lobster - not sure if actually local to the Mediterranean region or airlifted from N Am? \u00a0Overpriced and same as everywhere else. \u00a0Skip.Whitebait - they fry it and it almost tastes like egg whites. \u00a0I guess a cheaper filler food if you're still hungry after other dishes. \u00a0Skip.Saw lots of locals getting mussels. \u00a0May be good to try.Oh and they have a coloring sheet to keep kids tame while the adults are pigging out. So considerate!Pure seafood heaven - will hit up next time I am in Barcelona for sure!",
