    "Delicious! Everything we had was yumz! Mushrooms with wasabi. Hint of wasabi in vinegarette drizzled over finely sliced fresh mushrooms and cheese. Super delightful and a great start to the meal. Tuna tartarte was excellent too with bits of avacado and crispy thin bread. Lamb was very tender amd melt in the mouth goodness. Ham and chicken croquette was a tad too soft but delicious nonetheless. The chocolate was a good combi of dark chocolate ice cream with sliced choc truffles and chocolate brownie. Not too sweet or rich. 2 glasses of red, all for 45 euros. Don't mind coming back again. But come early or make reservations. We arrived at 8 and got a table immediately. Those that arrive 2 min after us are not so lucky. Staff prob gets a tad friendlier later in the night. Lol...",
