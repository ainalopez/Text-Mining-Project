    "Best ramen place in Spain! Period. Coming from a country where I know my ramen like the back of my hand, this place is as authentic as it can get. Make sure you are the first group to get in once the place opens as the it is really tiny. The wait is 40 minutes long, therefore, make sure you are close to the front of the line as much as possible. If you're near the end and the place will close in 30 minutes, come back at a later time or the next day.Staff are all super nice and ramen is spectacular. Such a wonderful gem and will visit next time I am in Barcelona and is craving ramen.",
