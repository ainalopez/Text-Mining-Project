    "Packs out on a busy Saturday mid-day so I recommend an earlier visit. Excellent bread with piquant olive oil which whets your appetite. Really nice, creative menu for a high cuisine lunch or dinner. Seafood dishes are super and trotter, veal cheeks, and about are all on the menu. Excellent ambiance and a nice alternative to the loads of tapas places (most of which are also excellent).",
