    "Too bad we landed here with a large group coming in for lunch. \u00a0Service varies from server to server. \u00a0Some of them they've tried their best to give proper English explanation of what the food items are, the rest is trying to avoid contact.Didn't order the paella as I feel it is too over price and doesn't have something that we like. \u00a0We just ordered an appetizer and didn't have much attention from the server afterwards.We ordered their famous dessert but unfortunately due to the busy place, they didn't give us a good presentation and the ice cream are half melted. \u00a0Gladly the floor manager is willing to exchange it for me and deliver a proper ice cream dish. \u00a0Must check bill as they surprisingly charge additional drinks on us... Sorry... Not a good experience.One thing important is if you sit upstairs, please don't take the middle section 2-people table as the server will walk into you or your chair to get to the tables close to the window.Beautiful place but really disappointed with my experience here...",
