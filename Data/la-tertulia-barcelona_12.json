    "The food was bad, cold and clearly old...it had been sitting out for a while. The meatballs tasted like they were rotten. By far the worst part of the restaurant is the staff. The waiters are very rude and treat customers with contempt. Save your time and money - this is the worst tapas bar I have ever been to after 15 years in Barcelona. \u00a0If I could give this place 0 stars I would.",
