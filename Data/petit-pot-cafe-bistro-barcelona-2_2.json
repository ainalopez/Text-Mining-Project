    "For 8 to 9 Euros, I was able to get an awesome lunch special! \u00a0The lunch special comes with salad, soda, and coffee or tea afterwards. \u00a0Your main selection can be a sandwich or 2 empanadas, or a burger. \u00a0I do believe that the burger comes with fries instead of salad though. \u00a0How can you beat that deal?! \u00a0I like a great deal but the truly impressive part was that the service was delightful and the food was delicious. \u00a0I selected the Spanish ham with brie focaccia that came out perfectly toasted. \u00a0Slight crunch to the bread without it being too hard and the brie perfectly melted. \u00a0The salad was a mix of baby greens tossed with cheese crumbles, grape tomatoes, oranges, and light vinaigrette. \u00a0At the end of the meal, they came by to take our coffee or tea order. \u00a0I had the cafe con leche which ended my meal at a beautiful note. \u00a0We definitely had a leisurely lunch and like most European restaurants, they do not rush you out. \u00a0When you are ready, ask for the check. \u00a0(Note: American Express is not accepted here)P.S. - The place was packed when we arrived around 2 pm, so they asked if we would share a large table with other parties and we did. \u00a0By 3 pm the place was pretty much emptying out.",
