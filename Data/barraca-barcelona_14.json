    "Came here by way of a New York Times article (nytimes.com/2014/06/01/t\u2026). I arrived near the end of lunch time and was greeted by the manager, who was tending the bar downstairs. I was escorted to the upstairs seating area and was immediately impressed at the space. The large windows allowed for fantastic views of the Sea. The Paella will not disappoint. Although the menu suggests the paella can only be ordered for two, they acquiesced my request to make it for one (I offered to take the second half home, if they didn't). Also had the Cod Fritters. They were definitely the best I have ever had. Light, fluffy, and perfectly seasoned. Served in 3 or 6 in a platter that almost seemed to be made exactly for that dish. The waitstaff were helpful and very accommodating. The manger even came upstairs to check on me told me to stay as long as I wished. They even offered to re-cork my bottle of wine to take with me or enjoy at the bar later. What a fantastic experience. Personal, friendly, and knowledgable waitstaff with a top notch menu. Don't miss this when you are in the area. And yes, they take Amex!",
