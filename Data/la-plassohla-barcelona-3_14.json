    "Very nice place. \u00a0Upscale and trendy decor, but the food is quite good and the staff is exceedingly friendly and helpful. \u00a0Seemed to be filled mostly with tourists and business-types, don't go here if you are looking for some kind of an 'authentic' tapas experience in Barcelona. \u00a0Do go if want good food with a very tourist-friendly staff.",
