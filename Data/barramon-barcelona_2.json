    "my favorite restaurant in Barcelona yet. worth the trip to Montjuic alone - away from most of the tourists on a walking street. Lonely Planet's suggestions were perfect for a light dinner. The staff was the most friendly I've met with in this Catalan city and if I ever visit Barcelona again I will come looking for Barramon again for some rocking Canarian tapas...",
