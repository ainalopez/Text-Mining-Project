    "Brilliant, ambitious, super-trendy restaurant on the Barceloneta beach - you have to fight hard to get a table. Celebrity hangout. It's just mostly seafood and fish really, but with daring, creative touches. Full of surprises - the menu looks ordinary, but the food has imaginative twists you wouldn't expect. And the fish and seafood are all locally sourced on the day. It's lively, busy, noisy and lots of fun. And the location is amazing, right in front of the sea.",
