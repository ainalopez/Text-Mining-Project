    "Very good, high-end restaurant in an upmarket hotel.We both had the classic tasting menu which was about 8 courses of really interesting dishes, impeccably timed and coming in a great order. Matched wines were also very good, though the size of the pours was on the smaller side. It is not cheap (\u20ac300 for two) - you have to really want that kind of meal for it to be worth it and there may be better value options out there e.g. Eatwith.",
