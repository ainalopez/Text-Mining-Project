    "So. Good. We can around 8:30pm and the place was crammed out the door. We came back after our first dinner and the place had calmed down a bit. The drinks were so cheap. The house white wine was really good and went well with the tapas. Those muscles. Omg. They were soft and creamy and oily. The calamari was also so delicious. We wanted to try the Spanish omelet but weren't hungry enough. Everything looked so good. Well priced food and drink, great eating atmosphere, helpful staff go great with good ingredients and an appetite. Worth a good trek to find this place (near the Picasso museum!).",
