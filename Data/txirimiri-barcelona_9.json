    "Words fail to describe this place. It is so bad. \u00a0I ate the worst meal ever at this restaurant. Not the worst in Barcelona or Spain or Europe. The worst anywhere. Liver pate came from a can in the form of a slimy cylinder covered in white fatty gook. Next dish baccala (cod) was enveloped in light green slime, had a mushy, gluey texture and a faint taste of dish detergent. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance duck came sliced on a bed of unappetizingly looking potato and mushroom mash, which was so salty it burnt my tongue. I assume that extra salt was added by \"the chef\" deliberately to mask some other foul flavor and to anesthetize my mouth in preparation for the duck. The sliced bird was done in the sashimi style. It was basically raw and bloody. Yet it was so chewy it must have hatched when Franco was still alive. It had a deep unpleasant flavor of something other than duck. Without thinking, I ate a few slices.The next morning I came down with severe food poisoning. \u00a0For the remaining two days in Barcelona, I could not even look at food without gagging. I drank water, ate plain bread and swore at myself for not walking out the moment liver from a can made its appearance.",
