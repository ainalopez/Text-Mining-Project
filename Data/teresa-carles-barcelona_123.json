    "For a city of porky-goodness, this vegetarian/vegan restaurant has set the bar pretty high. \u00a0I had the pumpkin/crispy tempeh salad with some sort of cinnamon dressing. \u00a0It really was a darned shame that I ate the whole thing because the desserts looked awesome as well. \u00a0The food was absolutely amazing and the service was friendly and quick. \u00a0I highly recommend this place for non-meat-eaters and eat meaters alike!",
