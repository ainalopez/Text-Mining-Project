    "I tried something from every section of the menu and it was all exquisite. The veal kebab was a standout as one of the best things I've ever consumed, ever. The staff was very friendly and the space, while very large, is still very intimate. The puddings are bread puddings, which caught us off guard but it was still yummy. Highly recommend splitting some of their yummy house-made wines.",
