    "Don't order the sushi with duck nuggets. The duck meat smells like, well, ducks and not well cooked. I don't know why they put cream cheese in sushi which destroyed the freshness and made the sushi taste like cheap McDonald burgers. With the same price, you can probably get better taste of sushi else where. The inside looks beautiful. I went there around 5pm and it was almost empty except there was a man and a lady sitting at one of the tables. The waiter directed me to sit on a table right next to them. And oh, my gosh, the lady was talking in Spanish loud and non-stop like a machine gun. I was like, oh, great, out of the 50 empty tables of this place, I have to be seated at the one \u00a0right next to these two people who don't mind the whole world hearing their daily dramas.",
