    "A really great Japanese restaurant in Barcelona. Good value for price, big portions (8 rolls rather than the usual 6) and delicious sushi. Be sure to try the Unagi to Foie, with foie and eel, as well as the Chicken Teriyaki with mushrooms. Overall, this is a great restaurant, reasonably priced and nice atmosphere. Nomo also does home delivery (minimum 20 euro), to central zones- check nomomarket.com/takeAway1\u2026 for an interactive menu.",
