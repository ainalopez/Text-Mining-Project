    "Dropped in on a Friday night without a reservation, but the staff were still able \u00a0to accommodate our group of five. I had heard that food servers in Barcelona were all business and not chatty with customers, and that was the case here. Being from the US, we were used to getting a guided tour of the menu. Communication with the staff in English was a little shaky, but it all worked out. After a few questions, we ordered some paella, sausage, potato bravas, soup, and a hamburger. All of the food arrived quickly and was delicious. The waitress gently reminded us to make a reservation next time on our way out. The house wine was good as well.",
