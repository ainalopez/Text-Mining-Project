    "Horrible experience. I wanted to eat paella and read the good review about Bosque Palermo. I skipped the closer restaurant and went there. The review is right about the restaurant being so crowded. I waited there for 30 mins and then the waitress located me at the bar to have dinner. Even the people came after me ended up with a table. The bar area is definitely not suitable for eating dinner. The width is not enough for the paella pan. It was extremely challenging to eat the food and I ended up with spilling the food on my newly bought clothes!!!It is the worst dinner experience I've had. Did not even leave a penny for tips and will never go there again!",
