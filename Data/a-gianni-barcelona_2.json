    "I have been wanting to try this place out based on the reviews. We started off with some nice refreshing gin and tonics. And then ordered a pizza Margarita and a pasta with prawns, and mushrooms. The pizza was perfectly thin, with a nice crunch and a sill slight chew to it. The sauce was really good and tasted like tomato heaven. The pasta was loved by my company, and she pounded away til it was done. I am not a like of mushrooms and i wont touch anything with them. Most of all the service was great. Our servers were super nice. Though it was slightly warm inside. Should have parked outside chairs.",
