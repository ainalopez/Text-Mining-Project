    "Having just come from Italy, we had reservations about getting pasta in Barcelona. The reservations only escalated when we walked through a dimly lit alleyway to get there. The minute we stepped in the door, however, we were given a very friendly overview of their menu (a bit hard to understand at first) and seated right away. The place was cozy and had great vibes. We both got the lasagna de carne, and it was an amazing blend of Italian and Argentinian cuisine. It was also very filling, and came with your choice of dessert--all for about \u20ac7. Would highly recommend. We will be back.",
