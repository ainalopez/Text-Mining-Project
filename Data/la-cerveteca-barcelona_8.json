    "A great bar to escape to if you need and like craft beer (a nice break from Cruzcampo, Alhambra, Estrella, etc...). A pretty laid-back ambiance, and typical pub feel with large barrel table tops (at a great height for leaning on). Smaller pub, friendly staff and good beer (about 8 on tap). The servers spoke enough English which made it easier to communicate. A nice place to go to in the Gothic neighborhood, off the \"touristy\" path.",
