    "Oh this place rocks! Wait a little bit to get in but so worth the wait. Have a cocktail on the street while inline. Then join the crowd in this tiny little Tapas bar and you won't be sorry. Octopus was epic and the argentine steak kabob were my favorites. Kinda loud but we didn't care. Very good drinks and very cool staff. Gonna try to get back before we say adios to Barcelona. Collecting business cards from the best places for our apartment owner this is definitely going in the stack.",
