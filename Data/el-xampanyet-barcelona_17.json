    "We had a delightful time dining at El Xampanyet--a lively tapas bar with tables and diners squeezed together. All of the dishes we tried (stuffed olives, anchovies and oil, pulpo, jamon) were delicious. The wait staff was very attentive and easy going. We'll definitely come again! Go on the early side if you would like a table... otherwise, there's plenty of standing room.",
