    "Arume is the best tapas bar we tried in Barcelona. The place was very close to the Barcelona Port. The inside was simple, modern and very clean.We started with 2 Blackberry Mojito and chorizo tacos. The monitors were addictive! pardon my language. The mixture of berries and alcohol was perfect. We also had seafood Paella. It reminded me of my aunt home cook Paella. Very tasty and makes you crave for more. We almost ordered seconds...The server was very friendly and attentive to our needs. Plus, she makes you feel comfortable.Arume is highly recommended.",
