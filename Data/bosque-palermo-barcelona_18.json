    "The food I ate here has to be in the top foods I had my whole study abroad trip in Europe! My boyfriend and I came rather late (an hour before closing), but the whole restaurant was full, inside and out. We waited about 20 minutes until we were seated and ordered the seafood platter and the seafood paella. The platter came out a lot faster than the paella (which takes about 30 minutes to come out). By the time we were finishing the first platter, we were already full. But the paella is a must! We couldn't finish everything so we asked if we can get it packed for takeaway.The wine here is incredibly cheap so we shared a whole bottle and I started feeling a little tipsy by the end of the meal. The service here wasn't the friendliest or fastest, but the food completely makes up for it! If I am ever in Barcelona again, this will be my first stop.",
