    "On a side street off la rambla, so not as touristy. Outside and inside seating.Great sangria, though the food is average. Seared tuna was good, nothing mind-blowing, acceptable portion for the price. Chicken fajitas were below average - flour tortillas seemed like they came straight from a grocery store. I would return with girlfriends for a couple rounds of sangria, but not for dinner.",
