    "The food was delicious and fresh, we had the chef's suggestions: baked goat leg and chimichurri ribs. Both dishes came with French fries and were really good portions. The flavors for both dishes were really good, it was a different take on Spanish cuisine besides the paella and tapas. The chimichurri was a combination of sweet and salty flavors which was very different from your Argentinian chimichurri. We also had the almond cake which came with a side of almond liquor. The cake was really simple, a little sweet and a nice balance of almond flavor. We will be coming back to try the paellas.",
