    "Caution: \u00a0This place is Hit or Miss. \u00a0I've had great food, and a great time 2 of my visits, but my last visit was rather mediocre. \u00a0The setting is great, the prices are fine for the quality and the type of presentation... It can get very crowded with a long wait - and this is where the problems come into play. \u00a0The service can be very dismissive, even flippant to those waiting. \u00a0People who just arrive can snag a table before those who have been waiting patiently - and the servers won't blink an eye. \u00a0pues, that's the way it goes here sometimes.The last time we came - I ordered \"ous picasso\" and my friend ordered a quesadilla. \u00a0my eggs came out within a decent time... but I was waiting for the quesadilla to come for my friend. \u00a0waited about 7 minutes before I started picking at my food, because it was getting cold and I was hungry. \u00a0I finished the small serving of food after 30 minutes, and as they were taking my plate away, we asked for the check and cancelled the quesadilla. \u00a0They finally brought it out saying it \"takes time to prepare\". \u00a0A quesadilla takes 40 minutes to fire from the time it was ordered? At least come up with a believable excuse! \u00a0It's a shame, I like the place... but if you have to go in there wondering what kind of night you're gonna have - it's not worth it. \u00a0Especially since there are so many great new places in this part of town. \u00a0This could be a 4.5 star place, but they are inconsistent and after the last visit, I'd have given them a 2.",
