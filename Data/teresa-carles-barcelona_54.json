    "I thought we would have a hard time finding places to eat because zi am vegetarian. \u00a0What a find!We actually ate here twice. \u00a0The first time around I had the lasagna. \u00a0It was the best I had ever had! \u00a0My partner had the 3 mini burgers. \u00a0He scarves those up. \u00a0We had to have desert, and ended up having the best chocolate cake. \u00a0They make the best coffee and red tea.The second time around we brought a friend and ended up starting off with the hum as appetizer. \u00a0There were 3 types of hummus, all different and unique. \u00a0The crackers and breads were delish! What we had for dinner, the hamburger, the 3 mini burgers and the lasagna. \u00a0Had to have the coffee and red tea and of course the chocolate cake again.Some may find this place a bit more expensive than other vegetarian restaurants but it's well worth the cost for fresh and organic food.Highly recommend.",
