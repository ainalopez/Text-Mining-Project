    "This is not a review on the food as I was never able to try the food!Not happy . Came all the way here to get food and took a 10 euro taxi but it's a very small place and although I saw a table empty for the 15 min I was there trying to get someone's attention to ask about the waiting list they rudely said 1.5 hours ! I don't want to stand outside the restaurent for 1.5 hours in the cold \u00a0just to get a small table for two , I asked if I could get food for take away as I was starving and really wanted to try their pancakes but I was rudely told not right now maybe in an hour ! I didn't like the attitude or level of service given. If this place is always a line I don't see myself ever trying to go here again plus I'm from out of town and will most likely never be in Barcelona again.",
