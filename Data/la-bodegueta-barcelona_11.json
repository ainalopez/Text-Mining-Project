    "So after reading hundreds of Spanish Yelp reviews, I'm assuming that guiris is a pejorative term for tourists, and as one of the previous Yelpers so kindly put it, this place is filled with tourists. \u00a0Well, I have to say here and now that I'm quite certain we were the only foreigners in the place when we were there, so I don't know what the heck he was talking about. \u00a0It definitely had an old kind of feel, like a bunch of abuelos should be in here playing dominoes or cards or something, and I loved that. \u00a0There were also a ton of Spanish products lining the walls that I might have bought if I felt like carrying them around for the rest of our day. \u00a0I think we had a couple drinks and ate Pa amb tomaquet and I think a plate of setas, and then went on our way, but we both really liked the atmosphere. \u00a0Does that mean we're two little abuelos in a 30 something suit? Maybe. You might miss it if you're not careful, you have to take a couple of steps down from street level to get into it. \u00a0And actually, I guess its close proximity to La pedrera might attract guiris, and I did read about it in my handy dandy Barcelona guidebook, but it was far from packed (though considering it was not any sort of regular eating time when we were there, it was quite full) with anyone, especially not guiris, and we really liked it.",
