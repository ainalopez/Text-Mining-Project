    "Hidden gem.This place serves some of the best food that I had the pleasure of enjoying in Barcelona. \u00a0The guys working behind the counter are all characters, yelling orders to each other, laughing, and simply enjoying themselves - it is quite the sight. Despite how crowded it was, we were lucky enough to score a couple seats at the counter. \u00a0We ordered: - Smoked Salmon - Croquetas (croquettes) - Padron Peppers - Spicy Tuna - Steak with peppersEvery single bite was out of this world, including the complimentary bread given to us at the beginning of our meal. \u00a0Even though everything was great, what really blew me away was the Smoked Salmon and the Steak with Peppers. \u00a0The cuts of salmon were thick and flavorful and the steak was better than some of the steakhouses in San Francisco.I recommend going out of your way to stop and have a bite at this heavenly place!",
