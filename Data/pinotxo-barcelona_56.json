    "heard about this place and just so happened walked into the market and it was right in front of us. also lucky enough to arrive right as two people were leaving. ALSO lucky that Pinotxo himself was serving our side of the bar. Every seat was taken at noon. He asked what we liked and we said everything, the only response from what I've read. octopus ceviche - my favorite thing. light and refreshing. could eat this every day. roast chicken - kind of like a lighter stewed chicken. good even though its not something i normally get. chickpeas - sooo good. was not expecting them to be that good. makes sense since i guess its his signature dish. carne - probably could have done without this. wanted one more item and this came out and had similar roast/stewed flavors to the chicken. Could not recommend this place more. Service was great and we left extremely full for like 35 euro.",
