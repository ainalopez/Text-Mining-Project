    "I'd heard so many rave reviews about Tapas 24 that I had to go, even after a failed first attempt on a Sunday. Unfortunately the place didn't blow my mind. The food is good, but I have a hard time distinguishing it from many other tapas restaurants in the city that can serve up just as delicious edibles.We came around 3 and there was still a line. We were able to wait inside the place and in the cramped aisle by the bar. We had la bomba de la barceloneta, truita espanyola amb pernil (omelette with ham), costelles de conill arrebossades (rabbit ribs), bikini comer\u00e7 24, lac\u00f3n ib\u00e8ric a la gallega (Galician style ham that came above a layer of potatoes), fideus a la cassola (a small pasta casserole), and a special of the day sepionetas (cuttlefish), which was the best thing we ordered but it did cost \u20ac16 and had maybe 8 or fewer pieces. It was well cooked and succulent. The rest of the dishes we got were good, but I'm not sure just how much they're different from other restaurants. The rabbit ribs may have been more memorable; they were crunchy and well seasoned, and not a common menu item elsewhere.The place is so compact and busy that it's difficult to expect stellar service usually associated with such celebrity chef-operated establishments. The open kitchen and the bar with diners watching the chefs at work are also reminiscent of a Jose Andres restaurant back stateside. After just short of an hour's wait and \u20ac77.50, I was happy that we checked Tapas 24 out while in Barcelona, but would hesitate to revisit next time I'm in town - well, not with another long wait again.",
