    "Lucked out by finding this tapas place and really enjoyed the food plus lovely service too! We were seated outside, as the inside was totally packed, but it was a quiet street and the outside tables were inside a boxwood and under shelter, so made for a lovely dining experience.I can totally recommend the salt and pepper octopus as well as the fried sardines. These were just deep fried to perfection and we devoured them .",
