    "Worth the hype! Delicious meaty goodness served with yummy cava. It's super crowded with a line out the door in the evenings. This is not a nice sit down so don't expect anything fancy! You get in, get someone's attention behind the counter and make your order from the menu on the wall.Note: bottles of cava are only served during the day. It is only served by the glass in the evening.",
