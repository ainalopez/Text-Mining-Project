    "Some things weren't great. But the tomato bread was the best we had in town. Grilled bread with fresh FRESH tomato salsa generously pasted on the slices. And the Pulpo a la Planxa. Awesome. So tender. I can taste the charcoal blending with the octopus meat. The potatoes with it were not a sad afterthought. So tasty and moist.",
