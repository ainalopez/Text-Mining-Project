    "We stopped by here for a snack recently. I had cava and split the guacamole with my husband. The guacamole was meh. My husband had the sangria which looked promising but was just ok. He also had some chorizo or ham I believe but was not really impressed. Service was a bit slow compared to other places we have visited in Barcelona. I will say it is a good location to people watch. Overall a mediocre experience.",
