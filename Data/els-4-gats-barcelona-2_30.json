    "So I made reservations before reading the Yelp reviews (which is unlike me). When I got back to my flat and read some of the poor reviews, I damn near blew off the reservation. So glad I didn't!Let's cut to the chase, the food was excellent, the service was outstanding and the ambiance was first rate. Was it cheap? Hell no! But this is Barcelona where everything is relatively expensive. Honestly, I've paid a lot more for a dinner for 2 in LA that this dinner for four cost.If you think that you are going to come here and hob knob with a bunch of starving artists (a la Picaso), don't waste your time and money. However, if you want a great fine dining experience, this is the place for you.",
