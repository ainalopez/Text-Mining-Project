    "Came here as per the suggestion of our host. \u00a0Lovely. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0Super friendly. \u00a0Affordable.We had the combo with the empanadas and the salad (one smart yelper took a pic of the salad and posted). \u00a0Get the salad. \u00a0It was a party in my mouth! \u00a0Its got greens, roasted zucchini, eggplant, tomatoes, cheese, potatoes, oregano, balsamic glaze, a piece of ham, mine had cottage cheese (maybe) with a slice of pineapple, thin granny smith slices and watermelon. \u00a0This is not like an ingredient list where there was more of the first and the least amount of the last ingredient. \u00a0It was superb. \u00a0The empanadas: delicious! \u00a0We had the cheese and onion, mushrooms and chorizo. \u00a0Favorite was the cheese and onion. \u00a0If you get the great opportunity to visit you will notice that we were kind of boring with our selections because they have real delicious things and more exotic (to me) things on their menu.Bocadillo: we shared half a hot sandwich: Lacon with cheese melted. \u00a0Heavenly... You could easily share the salad and empanadas and a full sandwich but we played it smart and only got half a sandwich and then had dessert...carrot cake: delicious.. not like I wanted to eat carrot cake there for the rest of my life, but it was solid and good and didnt have too much frosting and wasn't too sweet (its like they read minds) and the cafe solo (espresso) was excellent (I'm running out of good adjectives here...)Eat here....Our check was about 25euros (including tip).The server was so sweet and patient and attentive. \u00a0Everyone was working: the dude making the divine salads and the servers behind the counter serving, etc. etc. The place is also very attractive and airy as mentioned by another fellow yelper due to high ceilings.",
