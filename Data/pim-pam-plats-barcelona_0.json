    "Let me start off by saying AMAZING!!Pim Pam burger is a small burger joint in the Born district. When you're visiting Spain you usually would go for the tapas but on those nights that you crave for something different, I would say go here!They specialize in their beef/pork combo burgers. They're pretty big in size and they are juicy!I ordered the regular pim pam burger with a fried egg on top. I usually like my egg to be a little bit more runny but it was still good. You can top off your burger with tomatoes, lettuce, arugula and onions. I think the price was about 5euros.They also have amazing fries!!! It's very big so if you go with a bunch of friends, I would share because we had three hungry people and we couldn't finish it (it was that big).",
