    "This restaurant needs more good reviews on yelp! I went here for lunch with my family during our short visit to Barcelona. My sister saw this restaurant in a guide book and we decided to go. Best recommendation so far!The restaurant looks old (I mean the sign does say1786) and decor seems like it's from the early 1900s. And majority of the guests at the restaurants seemed like they were in the 70s. BUT. There really is a reason why the local elderly goes and how they stayed opened for centuries. Their food is great. Seafood dishes is a must and their pork dish in their lunch menu was awesome. It seems like a favorite for the locals. I would definitely recommend this restaurant! (For lunch at least)",
