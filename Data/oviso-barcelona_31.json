    "Character is the key. It mostly comes from the quirky staff, but the setting helps too. The outside seating area seems to be the only worthy option, however I've not visited it at night. Friends recommended it as a great place for breakfast. I managed to find a vegan gluten free option on the menu with a plate of over-grilled veggies. My friend had the tortilla de potatas and was mildly pleased. Mainly, the coffee, the sunshine, and the environment make it a good stop in your day.",
