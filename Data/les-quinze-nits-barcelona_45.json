    "Great service and excellent food!We end up in Placa Real after walking whole day around the Gothic part of Barcelona.We came in at around 6:00pm which was great since half of the tables were empty and we could pick our own table.To start we got some bread and olive oil, tomato and mozzarella salad with pesto and some fried calamari. For main dish we got a grilled dorado fish with vegetables and some sauteed cod fish or bacalao.For drinks we had three pitchers of Sangria... Super Delicious!As the night progressed a huge line built up for this place, so we really felt lucky to have arrived so early.Excellent food and great people watching place, just make sure you arrive early so you dont have to wait to be seated. This place gets packed.",
