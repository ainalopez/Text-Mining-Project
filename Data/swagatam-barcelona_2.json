    "Walked in skeptical bc of previous yelp reviews, however I was very impressed. The two co-owners are friendly and have great service. Ordered the paneer tikka tandoor (I'm a vegetarian) and the malai kofta with garlic naan and rice. That was enough to stuff my starving husband and i! They gave this amazing mint chutney for spicy eaters (ie my husband) that was probably the best he has ever had! Oh they also give one papadum for free in the beginning As an American who was missing her mothers homemade food, this place hit the spot! They even gave us a mini mango lassi for free since we didn't order any dessert and it was so good my husband left me barely a sip:/",
