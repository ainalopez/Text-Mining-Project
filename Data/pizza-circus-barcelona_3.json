    "We stopped by for a couple slices after a long day of walking- it was fairly close to our apartment. I got a pizza slice (for 2.50 \u20ac) with fresh herbs, cheese, and tomatoes, and my husband got pizza with cheese and red onions. The slices were large and delicious and packed with flavor (fantastic pizza). However, there was man out front who was smoking up a storm when we walked in. After we ordered, he came in (turns out he was an employee) and, after scratching his beard, served us our pizza without even washing his hands! I understand that standards are different in Europe, but not washing your hands after smoking and then serving customers food is pretty disgusting.",
