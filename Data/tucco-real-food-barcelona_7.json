    "We were in search of empanadas and decided to find this place based on the Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed! \u00a0Like the other reviewers noted, the woman that took our order was extremely helpful and explained the entire menu to us. Literally everything we ordered was wonderful! Empanadas, ravioli, veggie lasagna, house pasta, and desserts... Definitely get dessert. Everything tastes home-made. The price was almost unbelievable. Four people got a meal (very large portion), drink, and dessert for \u20ac36 total. \u00a0We are definitely going back this week.",
