    "Another TripAdvisor/Yelp mystery: How on earth does this place have so many good reviews?! \u00a0Chinatown, NY's worst offerings are twice as good. \u00a0Flies hovered over our plates here. \u00a0The Vegetable Dumplings also only had cabbage inside, nothing else. \u00a0Yelp, you screwed me over in Spain once again! \u00a0Mrraaaahhh!!!!",
