    "Oh hello, delicious tacos! We visited here for taco Sunday - three tacos for the crazy price of \u20ac8.50. The place is well decorated and I was captured by the cool print on the wall of the snowman and the mountain (I really want it!) as well as the lovely tiles. We were greeted by a lovely waitress who spoke impeccable Spanish, only to be revealed as an English lass when we \u00a0reverted to English to find out how the ordering worked. They have a board up with the taco options - 5 different choices including pork, fish, prawn, mushroom and lamb. We ended up sampling all of them as well as the side of grilled corn. The food arrived pretty quickly and even though they forgot one of the tacos it was quickly rectified. I really loved the fish one - on the menu it was described as bacalao which is apparently like salt cod. It was lightly battered and super crunchy which was perfect in a soft shell taco. The prawn was also lovely and had generous sized prawns. With a pretty relaxing environment yet super busy on a Sunday, this was a great place to grab a bite to eat. After three tacos I was really full and content with my meal - and especially at what good value it was.",
