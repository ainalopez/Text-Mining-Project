    "Food was amazing, fresh and soo good!We went fairly late at night and the place was packed.Traditional tapas style, there is no menu it's a \"this is what we're serving\" eating experience.Wine portions are very generous and delicious, and there is a wonderful apple like liqueur served with pastry.The food is very simple, fresh and delicious!The atmosphere is truly authentic of Barcelona, I'll be back one day!",
