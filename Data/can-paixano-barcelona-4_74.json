    "This institution is also known as la xampanyeria, with its own brand of house cova (Spanish champagne) that you may choose from. From the sweet pink and bubblies to the aromatic and effervescent bruts , makes it a great pairing with any of its tapas and deliciously salty sandwiches. Is a great eat to not to miss out on, specially when you are on the hunt for cheap eats. \u00a0When a glass of this cold and delicious bubbly is ranging from 0.90-1.20\u20ac and the bottle is around 4\u20ac... How can you not take full advantage of the price...??? But please, just because I used the phrase \"cheap eats\", this by no means suggest that the quality of food here is cheap...!!! So the next time you are in Barcelona and you find yourself hanging out at the topless beach near Barceloneta... Dive into this place for a snack and enjoy the charming crowded atmosphere that makes it a top choice when visiting this beautiful city.",
