    "This was the best breakfast in Barcelona! \u00a0I had the French Toast which was unreal!!! \u00a0My wife had the eggs benedict which was stupid good. \u00a0Great quaint place with all types of locals patronizing this place. \u00a0The coffee was legit as well. \u00a0Go here is you want a place that is off the beaten path. \u00a0Just be sure to get there early as the place fills up. \u00a0The waitstaff is very friendly",
