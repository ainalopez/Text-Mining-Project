    "Probably one of the best breakfasts we had on our honeymoon! \u00a0Milk is a must if you are in BCN. \u00a0The bloody mary was delicious and had a great kick to start out my morning, Mimosa was delightful. \u00a0I had the salmon eggs benedict and my husband had the triple whammy breakfast burger and they were both amazing! \u00a0The breakfast potatoes were delicious, the portion sizes were large and we left full and quite content! \u00a0Yelp has their hours a bit wrong, breakfast is served until 1600, no reservations available for breakfast FYI.",
