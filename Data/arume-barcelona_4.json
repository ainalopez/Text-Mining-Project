    "Pretty freaking exceptional. I went here twice, TWICE while in Barcelona because it's that great. Don't be thrown at all as your cab winds down the tiny side street because small paths lead to magical places. I was recommended this place by a friend who has lived in Barca for several years and I'm so glad she did. Service here is stellar, with engaging, wonderful friendly staff that feel like friends by the time you leave. The food is insane, from the ceviche (vamosss Walter!!), crispy Galician octopus, goat cheese and spinach croquettes to the paella that is just bursting with an abundance of fresh seafood. The first time I went with a group of 10 and I kid you not, we pretty much ordered the whole menu. The scallops were seared perfectly, the steak tartar was delicious, along with the extra creamy burrata salad. The king prawns were succulent and crispy, and the grilled artichokes added a nice earthy touch to the starters. Everyone couldn't get over how much they enjoyed their sea bass, tuna, and veal, paella and lamb. Their drinks (caipis, wine, beer, chocolate grappa etc are all fantastic) and they have a perfectly curated cheese plate for dessert I couldn't get enough of. Others raved about their sweet desserts as well. This is a must go place for me while I'm in Barca. Vegetarians ate here with me and were very pleased and it was very easy to make a reservation here via email!!",
