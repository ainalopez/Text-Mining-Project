    "We visited Restaurante Barceloneta as a party of five on a Saturday night around 7:30pm (with a reservation we made same day), in search of what we were told was some of the best paella in Barcelona. \u00a0We were not disappointed, and left having experienced a fantastic all around meal!We were quickly seated and sat upstairs in a beautiful area with a great view overlooking the water/bay. \u00a0The service was excellent...attentive, friendly, suggesting dishes we might like and extremely professional. \u00a0Their mojitos are outstanding!We greatly enjoyed their clams and garlic as an appetizer (great broth), and then we shared three of their paellas (seafood, meat/vegetable and black rice). \u00a0All of the paella dishes were excellent (even my kids loved and devoured them)...but our favorite was the black squid ink with cuttlefish...just awesome! \u00a0In particular, the service and paella were amazing. \u00a0 Great experience and we would strongly recommend!",
