    "Best meal by far during my recent visit to Europe. Just short of my experience @ Atelier Crenn in SF, but magnificent nonetheless. Three of us did the main tasting menu and consumed two bottles of wine for just over $800 US which is actually a very fair price given the gastronomic creativity, impeccable service, and overall delicious experience. Barthelona (Spanish lisp emphasized) will be a city I return to and I will certainly look forward to making plans to dine @ Lasarte again. Well worth the 2 Michelin stars. The only downside was that this 3+ hour meal killed any motivation to go out after, but I can't hold that against them. Chef came out to see how our meal was and they even gave us a tour of the kitchen after... muchas grathias!",
