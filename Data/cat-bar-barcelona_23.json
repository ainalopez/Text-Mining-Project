    "Small and cozy vegan joint with burgers and beer. Libel atmosphere and friendly crowd. Had the Champion burger and patatas bravas which was delicious. Salad with noodles & light pesto dressing needed a little more pizazz. Great spot to unwind and meet new people at the end of a long day of walking.",
