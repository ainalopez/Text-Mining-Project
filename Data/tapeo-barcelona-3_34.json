    "We came here for dinner our first night in Barcelona. We were lucky and were seated at the bar right away, even though they were pretty busy. We had the tomato bread, croquette, veal sweetbreads, potatoes bravas, beef cheek, and baby squid. Everything was delicious. The sweetbreads were especially good. Prices were fair and place was lively. The kitchen is open so you can see all the action. Would recommend this place for sure!",
