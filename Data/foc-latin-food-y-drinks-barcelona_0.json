    "Very nice little restaurant at the Passeig leading towards the sea at Barcelonas Barceloneta. We arrived to this wonderful city only 2 hours before and where wandering the sea site, when we got hungry. We promptly got a seat at the guest guarden right at the Passeig in the sun. The food was delicious as was the homemade lemonade. Yumm! So much what we had hoped for, instantaneous holiday feelings kicked in!The staff is very friendly and fast, the location great, the crowd international and relaxed.Great place for a snack, watching people stroll by and relax.",
