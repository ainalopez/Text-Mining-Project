    "Super busy. \u00a0Luckily I called earlier in the day for a reservation and for one for 9pm. \u00a0Packed. \u00a0Service was great. \u00a0Hard workers. Tuna tartare was fantastic, coming from someone who doesn't even like raw fish or tuna. \u00a0Truffle ravioli was just ok. \u00a0Came out luke warm. \u00a0The paella was ok too.",
