    "Really disappointed.The only fancy side of this restaurant are its prices. The food is overpriced but not as good as advertised. The only ok dish was the melon gazpacho. The calamari, the fried eggplant and the octopus were bland and below average. Te burgers are whatever. On top of this, the place is so loud and crowded that you cannot hear your thoughts.I can't believe I waited in line for a table!Go to Pepa Tomate instead if you are in Gracia.",
