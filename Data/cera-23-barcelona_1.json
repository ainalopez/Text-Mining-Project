    "This place reminds me of some of the restaurants in NYC in regards to the type of food. The size of the dishes are larger portion and is reflected in the higher prices. The staff here speak English, so communication will not be a problem.You should make a reservation in advance. The place really doesn't take walk-ins except in bar. Call ahead which is simple. The location has a romantic setting and not too noisy and crowded like some of the tapa places we've been eating at. Its a nice change.Place also doesn't serve tap water so you will get the bottled water.Food:Appetizers:Ceveche - this was good. Fish with citrus and pineapple bitsTuna Tartar - Slightly above tuna tatar.Main:Ravioli with Foie gras - I've never had ravioli with foie gras. This was a light dish and was very tasty. Highly recommendedLamb - slow cooked lamp. This was tasty but after two appetizers and Ravioli I was stuffed.The bill about 64 euros, which was more than most of our other meals.",
