    "Came here for breakfast. Firstly service is really slow. After awhile we had to ask someone in the front where the menu is and she just nodded towards the desk.. So rude. And it ordered eggs florentine Benedict. I thought I would have never said this while in Europe but it was the worst eggs Benedict I've eaten in my life. When I broke into it a whole bunch of water gushed out and made everything soggy. The yolk was overbooked, the bechamel sauce didn't even resemble b\u00e9chamel.. It was some flour goop that was so disgusting. Very unhappy after the meal.. The topper was the coffe here was crap- watered down and tasteless. Never again",
