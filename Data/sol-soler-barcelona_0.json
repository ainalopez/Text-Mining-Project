    "Friend who live in Barcelona longer than me told me this is where mostly local eat.The bravas is very tasty, it costs \u20ac3.20 I think, the beer is quite expensive, it costs \u20ac3.50, the sausage is nothing special but not bad.Next I will try chicken wings and lasagna. Although the lasagna has no meat, I heard its very good.The old man at first seemed to have no patience, he took off everytime we havent finished ordering, and when we called him he said ok ok wait, but maybe when we were there, the place didnt have enough people to serve. In the end actually he is quite nice.Btw, in the weekend the place is packed",
