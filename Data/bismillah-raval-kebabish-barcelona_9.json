    "Absolutely the best kebab in Barcelona... maybe the best kebab I've ever had anywhere. \u00a0I lived up the street from this place for two years and though I tried hard to fight it, I became a regular. They bake the bread in a tandoor right in front of you and mix some veggies and onion into the chicken on the grill. Everything's made right in front of you. These guys must be supply chain geniuses because there's always at least 5 or 10 people waiting for a kebab but still it never takes longer than a few minutes.They also have delicious curries and chicken tikka and the prices are insanely cheap. Best kebab of your life for 3.50 EUR!",
