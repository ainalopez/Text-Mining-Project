    "Great modern place with nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Modern layout is a nice change in the area and is what keeps me coming back. I go there in the afternoons and sit down quietly to do some work, which it is a great location for. Coffee is decent as are the drinks, but the nacho's were really poor, cold with no real flavor.",
