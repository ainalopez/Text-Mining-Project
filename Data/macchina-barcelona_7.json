    "Whilst randomly walking around Gracia, we came across this cute little gem and saw the fresh pasta being made behind the counter. \u00a0Having not had pasta in Europe yet (I don't know how it was possible going on 5+ days in Paris and Barcelona), we decided to give it a try. \u00a0I'm glad we did. \u00a0It's the same concept as a Chipotle in the United States, but with Italian. \u00a0You pick a pasta, a sauce, and the fixin's. \u00a0It was the perfect place for a lunch/mid-afternoon lite meal with a glass of wine. \u00a0It was also very inexpensive.",
