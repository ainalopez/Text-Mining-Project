    "Pudding is probably one of the coolest cafes I have been to! The combination of decor and great food make this a must go if you are in the area. You feel like you're entering a chapter from Alice in Wonderland with giant mushroom lamps and little fairies on the wall. The omelets are fresh and very tasty, and the service is great. Highly recommend this place!",
