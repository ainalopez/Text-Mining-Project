    "I really wanted to love this place because the decor and ambiance is right up my alley. It was also right across the street from Le Meridien Hotel, where we were staying. It's very modern but cozy, the staff is friendly, and everything on the menu looks delicious. The execution, however, was just completely unremarkable. We ordered a tuna and guacamole dish recommended by the waiter, and also a seafood and saffron rice. (We had not eaten paella yet on this trip to Spain and were feeling guilty about it, so I feel like this was kind of a punt.) The tuna and guacamole was tasty, but didn't need to be served together. The guac completely overpowered the tuna, so I found myself consuming them separately. The rice and seafood was pretty bland. It was served in a skillet but there were no crispy parts at the bottom. I realize again that this was not a true paella but regardless of what it was meant to be, it just didn't taste great. Again, super cute place and lovely staff, but just not fantastic.",
