    "RACIST!We originally came to this place on the first Monday after we arrived to Barcelona and reading the reviews online but they were closed. As we were staying in a luxury apartment across the street, we were so excited!So today as we turned the corner, we were delighted to see a line of about 10 folks. I told my mom to get in line while I ran an errand across the street. What transpired next is best described as RACISM!!My mom was told by the Asian guy to wait before coming into the dining room, while the lady with black hair said 'no' and told her to come. \u00a0Mind you, she was not the only single person in the line.I came about 5-7 minutes later to find my mom sitting down while everyone else received their food. At this stage the place is bustling, and she had not been offered to order, given bread or even water like everyone else.I then proceeded to flag down one of the ladies who seemed quite annoyed and said she has to find our waiter. At first we asked quietly, but after another set of minutes I had to 'loudly' flag down the other lady who had originally helped my mom who then found our waiter.What a horrible experience guys. Our only conclusion being the only black folks in the restaurant is that this place is ran by a bunch of spanish and asian racists. It's sad but true and very disappointing for Barcelona.We stayed to see how everything would play out, and the food was great.. but never again will we come here and I am letting all of my friends and global network know. These folks are RACIST!Do not support or buy from here. #disgusted",
