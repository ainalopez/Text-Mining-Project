    "Seriously some of the best food we had while we were in Barcelona. Yes, it can be somewhat difficult getting a table, but we were lucky and a nice couple gave us their seats as we walked up. People in Spain are so incredibly nice!We ordered the Padron peppers, grilled artichoke, grilled prawns and steak. All were amazing. Seriously, ALL. The steak \"cooked in its own juices\" is a must. It was tender and perfectly cooked. Use the bread to soak up the juices.Coincidentally, we actually sat next to two very sweet girls. Turns out they were also from San Diego...what a small world, right?! I saw them eat the prawns so I had to try and man, I was NOT disappointed. Some of the best prawns I've had in my entire life.I know some may think that El Quim may be a little touristy because its in La Boqueria, but don't be fooled. This place is incredible and has some legit Spanish food. Is the meal cheal? No, not really. Well, not if you're us. We spent about 50EUR for lunch. Worth every cent.",
