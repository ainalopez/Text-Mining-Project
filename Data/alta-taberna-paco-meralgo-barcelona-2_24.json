    "This was absolutely the best restaurant I visited while vacationing in Barcelona! We loved it so much we went again on our last night there. You must, must try the Chunks of garlic-fried fillet. This was the last tapas we ordered on our first night and I am so happy we did. The meat was so tender and juicy and it melts in your mouth. We loved it so much we ordered two of them on our last night there. Another favorite was the Patatas bravas. I tried Patatas bravas at every other tapas place we went to in Barcelona and Paco's was the best. Love the spicy sauce that it was marinated in. The other dishes we tried were also excellent including the Pan Con Tomate, Cod Fritters, Croquettes, and Fried Baby Squids. The Cava was also good.Not only did they have the best food, but the best prices. We paid reasonably lower prices here than other tapas places we visited and it was ten times better. If you are going to Barcelona, Paco Meralgo is a must! Make sure to make reservations. We didn't both times, but we luckily got a table.",
