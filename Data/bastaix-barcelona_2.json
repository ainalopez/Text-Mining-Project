    "If you feel like you haven't had quality authentic tapas in Barcelona yet, find your way here, near the big church in El Born. Excellent fresh tapas - they don't have them sitting on the counter, most are made in front of you in the small open kitchen. The chef grabs fresh produce right from the open shelves in the bar. We were blown away by the taste and quality of the ceviche, carpaccio, and even the standard patatas bravas and tomato bread. And they start serving food again at 6:00 (at least on Wendesday when we went), so if you're hungry before most other tapas joints open, go here! They were all very friendly too.",
