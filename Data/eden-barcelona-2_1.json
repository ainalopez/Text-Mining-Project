    "Visited Eden on the basis of Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. It's a few blocks from the Verdaguer metro station. \u00a0I was the only diner at 19:30 on a January weekday evening. I commenced with an insalata ciociara (9.50\u20ac) and Coke Zero (2.00\u20ac). The salad was large, fresh, and delicious, composed of Iberian ham, tomatoes, corn, rocket and palm hearts. Next came the spaghetti carbonara (9.50\u20ac), al dente with extra parmesan on the side. As I spun the spaghetti on my fork, the steam from the pasta rose in thick clouds from the bowl. It was very good. I closed with a crema catalana (4.50\u20ac), a perfect ending to a fulfilling meal.",
