    "Argentine steak is not for sale in USA (trade restrictions--what have you), so it's a treat to be able to get it when traveling. We went to this new place near our hotel for our last night in Barcelona dinner. We started with a pear and argula salad that was very nice. Then Argentine steaks, which were delicious--tender fat trimmed fillets. The garlic parsley potatoes that were crispy and delicious. Very nice red wine and cava. The meal, 2 glasses wine, 1 bottle of water, 1 appetizer, two steaks, one side, one dessert, \u00a0came to about $100 US--a good 30% less than what we would pay in a restaurant like this NYC. Everything was delicious. The decor is modern and basic--very quiet but we were there on the early side. This is a great choice for steak night!",
