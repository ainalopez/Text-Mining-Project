    "In my top 10 favourite small bars in the whole of Barcelona. This bar is located down the road from me (Nearest Metro station is L1 Rocafort), just off Gran Via de les Cortes Catalanes in between Pla\u00e7a Espanya and Pla\u00e7a Catalunya. This is a real gem of a bar and I've not visited many like it. With every drink that you buy, you receive free tapas. There are loads of different tapas that they have and you have to buy loads of drinks, should you wish to try them all! You can also buy extra tapas too which is very reasonably priced compared to touristy places on the Ramblas. Beer is incredibly cheap too - \u20ac1.80! \u00a0Despite being small, this bar is always full of local and I'm shocked on the very rare occasion that you hear English. 100% recommended!",
