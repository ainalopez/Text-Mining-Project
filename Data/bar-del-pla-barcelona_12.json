    "Best Tapas in Barcelona! Been on several trips to Barcelona now and have been back to Bar del Pla on two separate visits. The first time we went we had a short wait, roughly 10 minutes, to get sat but it was well worth it. We ended up staying for about 4 hours as we enjoyed the food (and wine) so much. The second time we went was for dinner and we had booked beforehand as there was a big group of us. It offers an amazing selection of tapas and traditional recipes.Don't be afraid to try something new, everything they serve is cooked to perfection! I am visiting Barcelona again in June and will definitely be going again!!",
