    "Great restaurant if you want a break from Spanish tapas. This is an Argentinian restaurant and has a little cantina next to it. Even the food from cantina is awesome. Tried the empanadas and the pasta, they were delicious seasoned right not salty. It is a jewel located close to Hotel Aranea and by Avinguda de Diagonal.",
