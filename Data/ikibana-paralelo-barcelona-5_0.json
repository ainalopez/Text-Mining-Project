    "My boyfriend and I went to Spain for vacation in 2915. Barcelona was our second stop (after Seville), and boy were we sick of tapas! We stayed at the Hotel Arts, and the concierge recommended Ikibana for dinner. Now, my boyfriend absolutely hates seafood, so pickings were slim. You can imagine how weary he was of this suggestion. But this turned out to be our FAVORITE restaurant in Barcelona, so much so that we went back twice!!What id highly recommend:- wagyu uramaki- Kani uramaki- wagyu entrecot",
