    "Oh My God!!! Hot Diggity Dog...Yelp has finally made it to Spain! Where were you when I needed you back in April during my vacation???Let me tell you this is a must try tapas bar if you make it out to Barcelona. My friend highly recommended this restaurant to me, so I knew I had to try it. I had a local show me where this restaurant was located at. Definitely the walk to this restaurant from La Rambla is a bit tricky! You have to walk through all these cobblestone alleys. The restaurants and shops along the walk was very quaint and lovely.You're sitting at the bar and it probably seats up to around 15-20 seats. It's a tight fit, so be prepared for the long wait. People are literally standing outside the door to wait for a spot.We ordered some beer to kill the time. It's was a good 40 mins. before we got a seat. There's no menu at this place. You basically tell the waiters what you feel like eating and they will create tapas for you. We ordered 6 dishes (mostly all seafood dishes). The seafood doesn't taste like the seafood you get here in America. It actually taste fresher and it was very flavorful! The menu changes here a lot, so I can't say to order a specific thing. However, if you love seafood just as much as I do go ahead and order a couple of seafood dishes. You won't regret it...the food and experience here was very memorable.This place adds up! I paid about 120 Euros here. I can only dream about coming back to Barcelona one day. I love everything about Barcelona!",
