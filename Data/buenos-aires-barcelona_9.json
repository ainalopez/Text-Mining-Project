    "Great service, great food, and perhaps largest portion of a glass of wine that I have seen. The recommended house special Malbec (Catena from Mendoza) was an excellent match for the steak. I had 200g fillet, and it was great quality meat and very tender. My waiter was engaging and attentive, and looked out for me well.Recommend the restaurant if you are tired of Tapas in Barcelona.",
