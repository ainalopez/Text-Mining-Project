    "We found this place through Yelp when we visited Barcelona in November. We arrived before it opened for dinner, and there was a queue. There were four of us - and I'll be honest, three people in our group wanted to leave. But I'd read the reviews! I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.15 minutes we were seated at the bar, and my dining companions were giggling in delight at the food we were being served. We weren't really sure what we'd ordered - the chef asked us what we don't like and then just served us a mix of tapas dishes. Expect lots of fresh seafood and vegetables, which you watch getting cooked just a meter or so away from you.We staggered out after eating until we burst some 45 minutes later - turnaround of seats is quick as there are people waiting for your seat standing behind you. We were all absolutely over the moon and high on the experience at eating somewhere completely different and exciting.",
