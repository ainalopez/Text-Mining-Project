    "Very much enjoyed our dinner here after a long train trip. \u00a0The steaks were terrific. \u00a0Was a bit pricey but still very enjoyable. \u00a0Of special note, the bartender was amazining. \u00a0He mixed a new, non alcoholic drink for our son and even gave him a little certificate and documented it. \u00a0Very cool.",
