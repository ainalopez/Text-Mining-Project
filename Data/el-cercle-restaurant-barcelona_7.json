    "First lunch in Barcelona! Nice upstairs patio in the el Gotic neighborhood. I had the pan con tomate which was a good size portion and was delicious. Cod croquette was good but nothing amazing. Papatas Bravas was ok too, but the oysters were my least favorite just because it did come with any accompaniments. Overall, I think it is a good restaurant, service was good and the ambience was nice too for a outdoor lunch in town.",
