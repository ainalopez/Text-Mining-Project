    "My first experience was quick: the bar was empty, with only half an hour before all reservations came in. 1rst lesson: always make a reservation if you wanna go on weekends.We felt rushed to get in and than leave, which was bad, but other than that the staff was really nice.I ended just having one beer and leaving, so a more complete eval will have to wait..",
