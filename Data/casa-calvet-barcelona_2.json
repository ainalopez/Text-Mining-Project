    "Casa Calvet is more of an experience than really delicious food. \u00a0The building was designed by Antoni Gaudi, which of course makes it a unique place to be eating. \u00a0It is also fine dining, with fun touches like amuse bouches and a little cream dessert with coffee. \u00a0The food itself was not all great. \u00a0The Chickpea blood sausage appetzier was phenomenal. \u00a0The scallops were awful. \u00a0So maybe it just depends. \u00a0You may end up with a great meal. \u00a0Either way, I think you'll have a fun experience! \u00a0Be sure to make a reservation.",
