    "Pretty overrated. Waited in line when it opened at 8pm. We were seated but had to wait 20 minutes for a waiter to come by. Others who waited around us already had bread and sangria. Strike one. The garlic shrimp was undercooked. The roasted lamb was pretty fatty and had no discernable added spices or herbs or even pepper. The ceviche was pretty good and the bread was substantial and warm. Again, after we ate we saw oil/vinegar on other tables. They didnt even ask. No help getting a second drink or dessert. We had the cheese plate which was pretty weird. Accompanied by sliced bananas? and a tomato compote. The cheeses seemed old and left out. No explanation from the waiter on which they were or about any dishes. Go to Tapeo or Bar La Pla instead. They were outstanding.",
