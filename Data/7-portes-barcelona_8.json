    "Every city has a classic restaurant, one that's been there for many years, serving traditional food under a classic setting, and one that's commonly recommended by locals. I feel like 7 Portes is that kind of restaurant.The food was simple but delicious and the wine didn't disappoint. Service was excellent and the restaurant itself is nice in an old-school kind of way. Overall, I'm glad we came here, because it's a place you have to come to if you're in Barcelona. Would I be back here next time? Maybe not. But not because I didn't enjoy the experience, but more because I'll venture out and try other restaurants.",
