    "Personally, I think this place is overrated. \u00a0I don't know why I didn't get it before, but asian tapas? \u00a0Come on. \u00a0That's just dim sum. \u00a0DUHH. \u00a0So, of course, you'll find your typical dumplings here. \u00a0But! \u00a0The skin is homemade! \u00a0So, pretty authentic - if you stick to the regular dumplings. \u00a0I however, saw their hao gao (shrimp dumplings, dim sum style) which I am compulsively obsessed with, so I ordered that as well. \u00a0What I received were these gigantic dumplings, with skin that was 4x as thick as it should be, and shrimp minced into a paste (the smaller types of shrimp). \u00a0Thattttt is not how hao gao should be - the skin should be very thin, and the shrimp should be big and cut up into pieces. \u00a0The rest of the food was also mediocre - the duck was only moderately tender, the bamboo shoots overly salty. \u00a0Again the normal dumplings seem to have been the highlight of the night.Also, this place is tinyyy! \u00a0But, at least it's open consistently, so you don't have to wait until 8pm. \u00a0Come earlier, and you should be able to find a table. \u00a0Otherwise, you should call for a reservation.So my final two cents? \u00a0Asians, you'll have tasted better. \u00a0Go home - your badass mother will probably scold you for even thinking about coming here and whip you up her secret dumpling recipe that tastes oh so good. \u00a0Everyone else? \u00a0It's not a bad place to try, especially with the authentic dumpling skin - especially when you don't have an asian mama to make you that!",
