    "Upon the recommendation of the receptionist at the hostel, we decided to come here! Usually, there is a pretty long wait here but I'd say...it's worth it! Although it might seem touristy with all the groups of English-speaking tourists...the food is still very good. It's on par with Cerveceria Catalana and they have similar menus (same owner? this is unknown...). We ordered a bottle of cava, pinchos with raw salmon, prawns on a stick, mussels, iberic ham and the house-made cream (similar to creme brulee). Overall, it was delicious-I highly recommend!",
