    "Pretty disappointed, mainly on the quality of the food. Everything was very bland and dry, special mentions to the fried calamari and tuna for being particularly inedible. The shrimp was alright and the octopus and razor clams were pretty good. Another annoying detail was how frequently they had to come on the loudspeaker and yell out numbers.",
