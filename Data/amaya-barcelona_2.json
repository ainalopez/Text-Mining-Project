    "Food is above average. \u00a0The drink are extremely expensive and so is the food. \u00a0I recommend don't even stop by. \u00a0The waiters are fast and attentive but for a 2 coke colas it's \u20ac15 and for two sangrias it's \u20ac23. \u00a0I would go somewhere else. \u00a0We had the seafood paella and the huevos estrillados con jamon iberico. \u00a0It was good but they are over priced!",
