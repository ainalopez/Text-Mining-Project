    "I've found my new breakfast heaven!! At Brunch & Cake it was like letting a little girl into a candy store... I wanted everything at the menu.. not just because I was hungry but because everything was literally mouthwatering. Everything they make at Brunch & Cake it homemade and it's healthy. After some days in Barcelona on holiday with great tapas, you need something healthy and less oily. And this was just the place without being health-organic-freaky!They served everything from free range eggs in all sort of styles, coconut bread, pancakes, sandwiches with pulled chicken, homemade yoghurt and granola, juices, cakes, etc.As always, when I can't decide what to order, I chose two things... This time eggs Benedict on waffles and yoghurt with homemade granola and to drink a fresh orange juice. The eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly and they hadn't poured too much sauce on top. The only thing was, that the waffles was too sweet for this dish for me - but my own fault. I could just had chosen it with normal bread.. The yoghurt was delicious with different kinds of fresh fruit and homemade granola. And not least the juice, which tasted of pure summer!On top, every staff member was so friendly, smiled and was really service-minded. I must say, a true foodie-oasis in the middle of the city! Next time I go to Barcelona I will even consider living in the area - just to be close to this great breakfast place! Go there - you won't regret it if you like authentic, homemade delicious breakfast/lunch! And don't be afraid to stand in line - it goes pretty fast.",
