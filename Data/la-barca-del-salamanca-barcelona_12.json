    "Don't eat the cold soggy weird bread that they bring to the table and charge you for even if you don't order it. Orders come out fast and are cold because they are all prepared way in advance and sit out. I guess the paella tasted ok but I'm just trying to think of something positive here. \u00a0It's a massive place that's just pumping out vats of seafood - \u00a0stick to the smaller more intimate tapas bars.",
