    "One of the best Japanese restaurants with affordable price! The house specialty of 3 tonyina nigiri (\u20ac6) is a MUST-ORDER! The toro is fresh and will melt in your mouth! The beef tongue with asparagus has great texture and flavor. The 9 pieces sashimi is fresh and comes with thick slices. The doriyaki with red bean fillings is just as authentic as the one in Japan, although it's a bit dry. The only thing that I don'trecommend getting here is the matcha cocktail which is the combination of matcha liquor and milk. Definitely come here if you are craving for some fresh, delicious, authentic and affordable Japanese cuisine! *Definitely make reservation because the place is small and will be full within 10 minutes after it opens!",
