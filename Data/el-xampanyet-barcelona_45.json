    "Extremely lively tapas place packed with tourists and locals. I wanted to experience something unique to Barcelona and I definitely got it here at El Xampanyet. When I first entered, I really had no idea what was going on since I couldn't find a menu and I don't speak spanish. After observing for a bit, I realized you just walk up to the counter and just start pointing at stuff you would like to order.The anchovies were salty, but I'd recommend ordering it since it's not very often you get to order them.The oysters looked like the were drenched in oil and that's exactly what it tasted like. The meat broke apart really easily when you bite into it, almost as easy as butter.The prosciutto on bread tastes good except it was the least unique dish I ordered.The bacon sticks were really delicious although extremely oily and fatty. The beer is only about one euro, which is super cheap and definitely helpful in washing down all this oily food. I had such a great experience here and would love to come back.",
