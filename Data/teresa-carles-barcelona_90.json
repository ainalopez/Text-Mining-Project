    "Everything at Teresa Carles was fabulous, fresh, and delicious. We started with the healthy nachos and antipasta plate and loved both. I had the kale salad and could eat it every day for the rest of my life. The smoothies were delicious as was the veggie burger, rice, and pumpkin pasta. Can't wait to go back.",
