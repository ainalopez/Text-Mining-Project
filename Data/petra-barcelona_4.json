    "This is truly a good dinner spot.We tried eating here on a Sunday, but, much to our disappointment, it was closed for the day. Not ready to give up, we stopped by on Monday night right after they reopened at around 8:00 p.m. When we arrived, we were the only customers inside. The advantage to eating dinner that \"early\" (by Barcelona standards) was that we had our pick of a table. We started off with a salad that had mango and pieces of salmon. It was very flavorful. We then had the rigotoni with pine nuts, creamy sauce, and mushrooms. This dish was outstanding. The creamy sauce was very good. We then had chicken with potatoes and fried yuca. The chicken and yuca were very tasty, but the potatoes did not have much flavor.For dessert, I had a piece of yogurt (which had the texture of cheesecake) topped with a mango sauce. It was a great tasting dessert. My fiancee had the crema Catalana, which was a bit too watery, but otherwise good. The service here was good and the food was great. If you want a great meal, this is definitely the place for you.",
