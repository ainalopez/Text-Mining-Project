    "The staff is phenomenal. They are knowledgable and capable. \u00a0There are two tasting menus. \u00a0The gastronomic menu was enjoyed by my husband and son. Skip the other menu completely. \u00a0Most ofThe courses were poorly executed and improperly seasoned. \u00a0The fist course that was common to both menus. None of us particularly enjoyed it. The pumpkin \u00a0texture was off and the taste to cheesy. The fried items accompanying this tasted like oil. \u00a0 I can go into greater detail with each course such as the rare, cold improperly rendered duck or the salty inedible rice served with the sweetbread or the underseasoned white fish with the olives. \u00a0While one may feel that they are experiencing something unique the bottom line is flavor. \u00a0It just wasn't there. If ever you want to try a true experience eat at blue hill in New York. You will see that there is no comparison.",
