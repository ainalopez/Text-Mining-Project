    "Ehhhhhh. I really wasn't that impressed. Where should I start? The bathrooms were FILTHY. The food? Really not as good as I had hoped. Definitely not good enough to justify 20$ a roll. I've gone to far better sushi in BCN for much cheaper. The desserts were even lacking a bit. I tried everything from sashimi to rolls and none left me feeling that WOW factor in my mouth. Sucks, but oh well. Kind of an overhyped place",
