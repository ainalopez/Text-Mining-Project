    "I must say, this was the best food I had in Barcelona. The husband and I got there on the late side... probably around 2:30... and this place was not only mobbed (we had to be sneaky to get a seat), but also out of most of their food items. Because of this, they just brought us the food they had, which was a beef stew of sort with peas, potatoes, and the most wonderful, delicious sauce I tasted in this city. I didn't let any of this go to waste, sopping all of the sauce with a piece of bread. We also got a sausage of some sort with a delicious red sauce and potato... this was also fantastic. The sausage was clearly made in house and was extremely flavorful (and I'm not usually a sausage fan). We had these two dishes and a beer for 20 euro... not bad. I would definitely recommend this place and be sure not to be turned off by the line... just wait and enjoy!",
