    "In a less touristy area, great coffee and friendly staff, the menu of the day was cheaper than the other places I've seen on Barcelona and the food was good. \u00a0This place really felt like being in a Barcelona neighborhood away from the tourist traps of the center. \u00a0 You can sit outside and see people going about their day. \u00a0We happened to stumble upon this place as we were looking for a laundry facility we found a block away. \u00a0So if you need to do laundry and want to get something to eat as well then this is the definite choice.",
