    "This place was of legend for awhile until I finally made my way out. \u00a0It is a really neat place, known for cheap champagne and tons of tapas to offer. \u00a0The tapas are just great and the price is right! \u00a0 Again, lack of tourists makes it an awesome experience.On the other hand, its so popular and crowded that it can be a bit of an annoyance. \u00a0People reach over your head, push you, and bump your drink often. \u00a0For people who hate being crowded (me), I'm not sure its a good choice. \u00a0Also, the neighborhood isn't very nice around it and it can be difficult to find.",
