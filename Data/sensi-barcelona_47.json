    "We came here based on the yelp reviews and location. \u00a0We wanted to make our last day relaxing so we chose a restaurant in the quarters. \u00a0My husband loved it but I thought it was pretty good. \u00a0It just didn't compare to the other restaurants we had already tried. \u00a0I think that's the main reason.We tried a few dishes. I can't remember their names but I will try to describe them.Chorizo Sausage was my favorite. I would eat this again in a heart beat.Parmesan Duck: The duck was a bit dry. Dry duck and parmesan do not go together. \u00a0My husband liked it.Truffle Ravioli: \u00a0Good but blandSangria: \u00a0One of the best Sangrias I've ever had!Iberian Suckling Pig: \u00a0Too Crispy and overcooked. My husband liked it.Asian Style Iberian Pork: \u00a0The flavors did not go wellIt's very hard for me to rate them 3-star because I really want to give them a higher rating. I tried so many amazing restaurants prior to this. \u00a0It just did not meet up to standard.",
