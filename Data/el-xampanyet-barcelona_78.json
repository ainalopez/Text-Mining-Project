    "my favorite tapas place in barcelona (granted i've only been to a handful, but all have been rated highly). to start, the staff is friendly and makes you feel like part of the family, even if we're just tourists.the tapas were all fantastic - from the roasted peppers to the tuna to mussels. not to mention the house cava (of which my cousin and i polished a bottle in no time)came back a second time during my wk stay in barca and plan to go back every time i'm in town",
