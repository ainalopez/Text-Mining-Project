    "We were recommended this place to try while on holiday in Barcelona. It's a small bar/restaurant on Carrer Montcada in the Barri Gothic, the historic part of Barcelona. We chose to sit in the bar rather than the restaurant. The place is decorated with colourful Spanish tiles, and strings of chilli and garlic. The menu is typically Catalan, and they do provide a menu in english, although the descriptions aren't very detailed - some other customers were warned off the 'beef stew', because the waitress expalined the stew was actually made out of tripe! The waitresses were very helpful - they spoke good english, and for the more esoteric dishes were very descriptive. We ordered 3 tapas dishes to start, steamed mussels, chorizo and black pudding - all of which were delicious, fresh and piping hot. Then we had a rabbit paella, and a plate of barbecued squid - both equally delicious. Desserts of fruit and chocolate fondue and crema catalana (like creme brulee) finished the meal off perfectly. The bar has a wide selection of bottled wines displayed around the walls, and a short wine list of wines available by the glass - 125ml glasses were 3euros - 4euros which is actually a bit expensive, but the wines were very good quality including a delicious Valdepenas. Beers were considerably cheaper. With a couple of drinks each and a couple of expressos, the bill was nearly 60euros for two, but well worth it for the lovely food and the relaxed ambience.",
