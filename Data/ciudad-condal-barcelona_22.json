    "Don't get me started on finding this place!!! DO NOT USE GOGGLE MAPS! I swear to God it takes the LONGEST route possible every time!! Researched this place before we arrived in Spain. Great reviews! Super cute (and large) restaurant! Nice d\u00e9cor, a large number of wait staff, nice sushi bar if you like seafood. We ordered tapas (bocadillos and pappas and ?? other stuff I can't remember) but it was all good! And super cheap! Everyone around me had seafood dishes and if the locals are eating there, you know it's got to be good!",
