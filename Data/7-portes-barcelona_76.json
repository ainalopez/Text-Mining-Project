    "Our only mediocre meal in Spain and it's because my husband was in search of paella. I warned him that paella is really a dish from Valencia and we most likely wouldn't find a place that's going to wow us. However, he was determined, and did a bit of research, which landed us at 7 Portes. I think this restaurant must be listed in every guide book from every country because while we ate our dinner, the dining room looked like the United Nations of diners, all clutching a guide book from their country. The seafood in the paella was well cooked, but it was too over salted to thoroughly enjoy. The atmosphere is white tablecloth and black-suited waiters, all of whom speak English. I wouldn't say it was a horrible meal, but compared to the other amazing places we dined, 7 Portes was not worth it.",
