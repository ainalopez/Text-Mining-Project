    "The place is small and very noisy inside. \u00a0We came in to have Sunday brunch after we were told the place next door (Milk) had a wait. I ordered a mimosa which was good. \u00a0We asked for tap water but were told that is illegal in Barcelona (other restaurants never told us that). \u00a0I ordered the Eggs Benedict Barcelona which had pesto, mozzarella, and a tomato with Hollandaise sauce. The Hollandaise sauce didn't seem home made. \u00a0It came with potatoes which were pretty tasty. I ordered a aside of hash brown potatoes (the waitress didn't tell me my dish came with potatoes, thanks). \u00a0The hash brown was terrible! I took one bite and was grossed out. \u00a0It tasted like what I imagine a spoonful grease would taste like. \u00a0They still charged us for it even after we complained. My hubby ordered the pancakes with dulce de Leche and bananas. \u00a0They were good and filling. \u00a0He asked for a large glass of OJ but the waitress told him they don't sell OJ in large glasses. He asked if he could order 2 glasses and she was still confused. It was just a weird interaction. \u00a0I don't think I'd really recommend this place.",
