    "This tapas restaurant looks very alluring from the outside, but on the inside, you notice that the first room with its shiny brass and hanging cured hams is really the nicer one. The second room which is the one reserved for smokers is a bit of a let-down with its large non-descript cubist paintings lining the very high walls of what one day may have been an inner court. The cuisine is the typical tapas one but of excellent quality: cured hams, various types of croquettas, Spanish style sandwiches (flautas and cocas), grilled meats. You can also come here during the afternoon for coffee or tea and cakes. Most visitors were either Catalan or Spanish speaking. Good quality for money.",
