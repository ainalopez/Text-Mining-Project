    "Sat outside the market on a beautiful Barcelona day. Enjoyed several apps and the prawns. Each dish was very good and the prawns were fresh. Our waitress was attentive and service was quick. I enjoyed the food while watching the people shop in the market and those in the courtyard. This was the best meal I had in Barcelona.",
