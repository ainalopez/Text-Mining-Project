    "Thorough accommodating staff were friendly while I worked through my poor Spanish :). The tomato with buffalo mozzarella blew our minds and the croquettes made us wonder why we'd not tried them before. \u00a0Seriously fresh scallops and octopus that tasted of the sea. Don't miss the dark chocolate mousse with orange notes - it was the perfect ending to a truly world class meal.",
