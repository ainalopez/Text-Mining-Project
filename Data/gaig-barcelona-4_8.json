    "Dress business smart if you are going to have lunch here. This elegant, smarty decorated place has all the makings of a good meal and there was no disappointment. We ordered a la carte, but there was a lunch tasting menu. Every dish came out perfectly...although my only complaint was the parmesan cheese \"cracker\" topping on the green bean, gamba salad was a bit too done. The service was professional and quick. My buttifara negra with peas was spectacular, but you better like peas in you order this dish; it's a whole plate a peas with about 1 tablespoon of blood sausage mousse deliciousness. Most of my lunch was spent craning my neck to see what was on all the plates going out to other customers...they all looked and smelled great. I will certainly be coming back here, along with Rais de Galicia. Two stand outs on our Barcelona trip.",
