    "If you are a fish lover, willing to try different tastes, enjoy long tasting menus and like the idea of fusion food, give Pakta a try. I have to admit sometimes I am vowed by their seasonal menu and other times I reminisce over how extraordinary the food tasted previously. Sometimes the flavors on their extensive menu taste so unique and other times the dishes can feel a little repetitive.Nevertheless, I haven't once left the restaurant with less than a happy tummy and a wonderful evening.Unlike other reviewers, I have never been rushed through my meal although I could see it happening depending on what time you go to eat. They are pretty strict about when to give breaks during the course of dishes. However, I think they'd accommodate accordingly if you remarked about feeling rushed. On that note sometimes the service is impeccable, hardly any waiting time between dishes. Other times, it can be slower than what they have me used to with longer pauses. That is just comparing them with themselves again, just different times. Frankly there isn't another restaurant I can compare them to.",
