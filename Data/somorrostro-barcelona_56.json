    "Very original cuisine which changes every day. Possible to have el menu del dia at 16,50 euros (2 courses + dessert), or to choose between a vast selection of sophisticated flavours at 23 euros (2 plates) or 28 euros (3 plates), drinks excluded.And if you feel brave, there is even the option menu degustacion at 43 euros. It's small and hidden from the touristic areas, so definitely worth going on a quiet night.",
