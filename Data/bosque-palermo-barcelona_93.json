    "This restaurant was over rated by the Yelp reviewers. I have better tasty seafood paella in California and Israel than that of Bosque Palermo. The shrimps or prawns were dry and not fresh. Mussels were small and 20% of them were not opened. I ordered those dishes per Yelp reviewer recommendation more than I can eat and paid almost 40 Euro for one person without wine. The waiter seemed not happy to pack the food for me to go even he charged me take out fee and 10% tips. Bosque Palermo is a long walk from any metro stations. The opening hours Yelp published are not accurate. They do not close at 4 PM between lunch and dinner. I found people eating there were tourists like me with a Yelp print out. I feel that the over rated reviews had misleaded me.",
