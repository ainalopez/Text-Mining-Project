    "*vegetarian friendly. Our waiter was able to change a few dishes to accomodate two vegetarians Modern tapas in a great location close to l'universitat stop of metro. Great food. Even I as a vegetarian was fine with the egg dishes they had. Friendly staff. Busy so expect a wait if you don't have a reservation on a busy night Would have given five stars for food. Be careful if you have food allergies as one person in our group did to shellfish which he told the Waiter. Then Ordered paella which came with shrimp. In the waiters defense we said this in English and even though his English was pretty good there may have been something lost in translation.",
