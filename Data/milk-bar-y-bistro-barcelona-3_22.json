    "This was difficult to find. It's down a small alley and there is a lot of construction going on. We got in there about 9:30am and just beat the lines to get a table without a wait. The food was fantastic. My wife had the bacon and egg benedict, which i regretted not ordering for myself, and I had the hamtastic. The eggs were fluffy and the omelette was loaded with mushrooms and cheese and ham. If you are in the gothic quarter and want a good breakfast, this was the best. The ambiance is great and the service was fast and efficient.",
