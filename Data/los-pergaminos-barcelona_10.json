    "I'm torn about Los Pergaminos and have conflicting thoughts.If you want a good Spanish cuisine/tapas experience, this place probably deserves four stars. They had a good selection of tapas (we enjoyed the foie gras stuffed figs, the honey eggplant, the patatas bravas, and the morcilla) and the paella as definitely tasty and authentic.However, I give it three stars because some of the dishes seemed a just a little too oily and our server kind of pressured us into ordering more than we initially had wanted (she said we wouldn't be full enough after four tapas and a paella.... quite wrong. I felt like I had to be rolled home). The figs were an experience but I felt that they could have been seasoned a little more interestingly, and the eggplant, though delicious for a few bites, were the overly-oily culprit. So, good for Spanish cuisine. Order less if you don't want to be in a food coma for several hours after.",
