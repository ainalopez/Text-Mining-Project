    "If I could've given Koy 6 stars I would have!Very low key recessed entrance with a small sign. Almost like they would not want everyone to find them here. You'll need your google map to guide you here since it's down a small alley with not much else next to it.I decided on the tasting menu. There are two. One takes about an hour to go through and the other around two hours. I went with the one hour choice. I was in foodie heaven! I took pictures of every dish served. All I can say is from start to finish this restaurant was out of this world. The cooks and supporting staff all worked in concert. A spectacular thing to witness.They open up for evening dining at 8:30 sharp. \u00a0Not any earlier. Reservations are recommended, but you can take your chances like I did. All the food looked very select and fresh. It was a masterpiece of culinary skills to see how the plates were put together. I felt like I was on iron chef!Probably my best dining experience on all levels anywhere so far. The staff were very friendly and made sure they thanked me for coming as much as I totally thanked them for the experience.",
