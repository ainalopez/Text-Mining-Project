    "My wife and I had brunch here to start our day. The atmosphere is very pleasant with a French feel. Large windows afford the opportunity to people watch on Via Laietana and the Palau de Musica is steps away.The crepes were some of the best I've ever had and the staff were very friendly. The service is quick and the price is great for what you get. We had the Nutella crepe and huevos y chorizo. Both were extremely tasty. Bathrooms are well taken care of. If you are looking for a delightful place to have crepes all day this is the place to go!",
