    "This place was great for outdoor seating. We enjoyed Cava and a few tapas in this little square in front of the Santa Maria church. This little area was packed with good people watching and it was a perfect place to take a break after touring the Gothic Quarters. We enjoyed our rest so much we ended up sharing a couple bottles of Cava before heading out again. I definitely recommend a visit.",
