    "One of the best meals I've had in Barcelona. This place is super cute, the owners and staff are extremely nice and welcoming and the food is delicious. We ordered a few tapas for lunch and were blown away by each of them. I highly recommend the asparagus salad, the chicken croquettes and the eggplant and goat cheese croquettes!",
