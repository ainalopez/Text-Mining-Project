    "I admit that I don't have much to compare to, but I absolutely loved the experience here. \u00a0Plan to wear comfortable shoes as you'll be standing by the bar. \u00a0There's a range of pinxtos and all delicious, particularly the red pepper stuff one. \u00a0The bartender was great and explaining which item was what. \u00a0I could've stood there and ate and drank all day. \u00a0They only have Budweiser on tap though...",
