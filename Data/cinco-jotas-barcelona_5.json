    "I stumbled upon cinco jotas late on a friday night after visiting font Magica nearby. This restaurant is located atop the cinema in the arenas de Barcelona high rise near placa de espanya. You must ride the elevator or escalator to the top floor to get here. After walking around and glancing at the many restaurants on the rooftop, I was drawn in by the cool chill house music coming from the dj on the patio so had to check this particular place out. We sat on the screened in lanai area and asked the server for a menu. He informed us the kitchen was already closed at 11:30! Boo! But the bar was still open, so we ordered sangria. When it FINALLY arrived 15 minutes later, it was delicious. Very well made and quite a large glass, so no complaints there. Overall we really enjoyed spending time here listening to music, people watching and enjoying our drinks. I did deduct 1 star for lack of food and the lackadaisical service from our turtle stuck in molasses speed server. If you go here just be patient!",
