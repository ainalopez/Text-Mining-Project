    "Every restaurant in El Born area was pretty good. Cal Pep was my favorite! We showed up about 15 minutes before they open and people were already lining up. We were seated at a bar area and our server was excellent! He spoke English for us and Japanese for people sitting next to us. We didn't see a menu so he recommended a few dishes to start with and we kept adding on the ones we liked or when we see other people are getting. I could see their fresh ingredients and there is one guy cooking everything on a griddle. Nothing fancy but simple, delicious food. We liked razor clams and order it three times (found out they were only 12 euro per plate. I would have ordered more if I knew it). This place is more expensive than other all you can eat tapa places around the area but you do get quality food and service. I highly recommend it!",
