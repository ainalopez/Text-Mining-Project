    "Hands down the BEST sandwich joint in Barcelona. As a uni student, this place is a godsend. For 4 euro you're getting a chicken/meat/veggie sandwich (to call it a sandwich is a huge understatement.. Lol more like a mountain of food stacked on a piece of delicious bread) The beauty of Bo De B lies in the fact that you are getting literally so much bang for your buck (or in this case euro), Whereas most sandwiches in Bar\u00e7a consist of half of a baguette with 2 measly slices of Jam\u00f3n y queso (como se dice, carbo-load) The quality of the ingredients are great as well!! all the meats are prepared individually. The vegetables are fantastic. Live a little. Get the goat cheese and all the sauces. It's a taste bud explosion. Essentially, this is a must do must try if you're in Barcelona. I HIGHLY recommend the chicken and goat cheese, decked out with as many fresh colorful toppings you can fit. CONS:Loaded with tourists (not exactly a well kept secret) For this reason, Get here either EARLY to beat the line, or in between normal Bar\u00e7a eating hours. Keep in mind, it's a tiny little place, maybe 4 tables in total. On a sunny day take your beautiful bocadillo across the street and eating it on the beach! (Bring a fork and lots of napkins) Be warned- it's gonna get messy... Enjoy!!!",
