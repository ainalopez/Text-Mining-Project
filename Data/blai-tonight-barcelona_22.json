    "There are so many tourist traps where you can get overpriced tapas--and this is NOT one of them. \u00a0This is my favorite tapas bar in Barcelona. \u00a0It's nothing fancy--a local dive, with cheap, Spanish beer and a wide assortment of 1\u20ac tapas. \u00a0 \u00a0There are about 15-20 tapas to choose from: \u00a0a variety of croquettes, and different meats and types of fish mixed with different vegetables, Spanish cheeses with marmalade, potato or spinach tortilla (not to be confused with a Mexican corn tortilla--this is like an eggy fritatta). \u00a0There's a great honor system, where you eat as many as you want, and count how many toothpicks you've got and pay at the end. \u00a0The staff is friendly, and was very patient with my Spanish.",
