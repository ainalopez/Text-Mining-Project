    "Hello Tapeo! \u00a0Tonight was the first of what will likely be many visits.The menu was tantalizing, but not overwhelming. \u00a0We sampled about 5 dishes, and I already know what I want to try on my next visit. \u00a0we tried:Asparagus tempura with romesco sauce - excellent. \u00a0we spied:Leeks (confit?)... I don't remember the description... but it looked amazing. \u00a0will try next time.we tried: Broken eggs with Botiffara - too heavy as the last plate... good, but the least favorite of what was served.we spied:Fideus with cuttlefish - Joan is allergic to seafood... this is one I would try on my own.we tried:beef filets with chimichurri sauce - I would definitely get this again!Iberian pork ribs with honey glaze - delicious.Bombeta & Cod fritter - loved them... cheap too!Dessert of Chocolate with olive oil & bread - nice rich flavors. \u00a0Prices: \u00a0for the 2 of us, with 2 glasses of wine each, 5 plates, water and service - this came to about 60 Euros. \u00a0And the service couldn't have been any friendlier. \u00a0I will be back... and i'm bringing more friends.",
