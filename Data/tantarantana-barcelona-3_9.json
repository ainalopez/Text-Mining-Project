    "My family spent 5 days in Barcelona. We stayed away from the fancy, expensive restaurants, and this was my favorite of those we visited, slightly edging out Bormuth, which was also good. Nice atmosphere, lively without being too loud, kid-friendly, and of course good food at reasonable prices. Wait staff was friendly and the restaurant was full when we were leaving.",
