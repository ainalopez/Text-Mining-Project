    "Wow! \u00a0Love this place! I've gotten lit up here more than a few times! They have great caba and awesome Churizo sausage. \u00a0It's full of good spirited tourists and locals. \u00a0The best thing to do is get smashed and chow down on some great tapas then go hit the town. \u00a0It's a true Barcelona experience!",
