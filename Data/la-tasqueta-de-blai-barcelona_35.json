    "This place was just what we needed in Barcelona - get, delicious food & booze, a 1 minute walk from our Airbnb flat with lovely staff and comfy seating. We visited here when we realised things were looking tight in the Euros department. We popped in to find the long counter covered in pintxos - a huge range that were refreshed often and clearly marked with veggie options. Each pintxos was \u20ac1, just grab a plate and load it up. Too easy. Drinks were also really cheap - small wine and beer were also \u20ac1. I enjoyed everything I ate here - and we are a lot. I think we returned 3 times in our visit and each visit was around \u20ac10 which is crazy good value for a meal for two with drinks. Every staff member we spoke to was lovely and helpful. It had a really nice relaxed vibe and awesome music - Elvis one day, Beatles the next. This place is well worth a visit, I'd go out of my way to return here if we go back to Barcelona.",
