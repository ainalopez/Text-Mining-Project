    "Delicious! \u00a0A perfect Spanish pre fixe menu. Started with a huge salad. Loved the plums and nuts. Then a big cheese, jamon and pate board. One nice bottle of red wine and water. Total under $50 euros. The food was outstanding. The pate divine. The restaurant itself beautiful. Don't sit upstairs.",
