    "A crowded wait at peak lunch times but well worth it! The portions are huge so order conservatively. Everything we had was amazing!1. Croquettes- best I had in Barcelona! Light not too fried and oily tasting. Absolutely perfect! 4 euro2. Mushroom & foie gras tower- seared foie gras was perfect. A little greasy but soooooo delicious nonetheless. Like eating at a 5 star restaurant! 23,50 euro for this dish3. Iberian ham fed acorns 16 euro- not my favorite and too pricey",
