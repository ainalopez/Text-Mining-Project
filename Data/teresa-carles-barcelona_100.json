    "Super friendly wait staff and well designed interior. From the moment you walk in you're surrounded by fresh vegetables and a wholesome hip vibe. I was the first of my party to arrive and they offered me sweet potato chips in the waiting area. Summer juice with watermelon was refreshing. Ravioli with goat cheese and beets balanced, tasty and beautifully composed.",
