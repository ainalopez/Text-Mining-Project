    "On this hot afternoon, Mussol was empty except for the BF nursing a beer and quietly cursing the trials and tribulations he had thus far endured in this strange land. I, having just witnessed a double car-on-pedestrian traffic accident, was fluttered enough to forget I was annoyed he had texted he was across the street when in fact he was around the corner.Our waitress was very friendly and like everyone we met, was amused but pleased at our attempts to speak Catalan. As soon as she saw me stumble in, she met me with a big glass of water.So we had a drink and a snack and a bit of quiet off the otherwise chaotic Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia. And it was very nice. Nothing could be more authentic than that.p.s. The pedestrian was okay, in fact he sprinted away, realizing the accident had been his fault.p.p.s. I guess I didn't forget if I'm still talking about it 3 months later. ;p",
