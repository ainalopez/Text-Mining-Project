    "This place is great! We went there a couple of times when we were in Barcelona. Made sure that we ate there on our very last night in town. \"La Bomba\" is the best! \u00a0The staff in-service is wonderful! Heck, look at us hanging out with the owner! We also got a nice bottle of wine at the cellar that's adjacent to it.",
