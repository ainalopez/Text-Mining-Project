    "The salad + 2 empanadas special is plenty to share, and very delicious! The salad includes a cheese filled zucchini, wild rice salad with tuna on tomato, carrot and sweet potato slices, cubed mozzarella, dried cherries, asparagus, and sprouts on a large bed of lettuce. We chose the ham & cheese and capresse empanadas. Both were savory, flaky, and toasted to perfection. There is a reasonable amount of indoor and outdoor seating Sit first to be served or head straight to the counter for take-away.",
