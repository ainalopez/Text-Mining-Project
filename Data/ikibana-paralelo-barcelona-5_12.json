    "It was our last night in Barcelona, and as always, we try to look for that one restaurant to have a memorable meal. \u00a0We just left the Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya and just started wandering around to our hotel. \u00a0We passed several restaurants and then happened to come upon Ikibana. \u00a0The patio was full and we were greeted with a cheerful, \"Hello, I'll be with you in a moment.\" \u00a0Then a hostess came out and asked if we wanted a table (in Spanish), at least that what I thought she said. \u00a0She then switched to English. \u00a0I guess my accent gave it away.We were given a high table near a wall that gave us a great view of the whole dining room. \u00a0Very relaxed and inviting atmosphere. \u00a0There were a number of diners inside and everyone looked pretty happy. \u00a0Our server, Yuri, spoke pretty good English and was very pleasant and helpful. \u00a0Even brought out some complimentary edamame during the meal. \u00a0I think he felt some of the dishes were taking too long, but we didn't think so. \u00a0I ordered a bottle of Rioja for the partner and a bottle of cava for myself, since I like champagne. \u00a0Both were great!We ordered gyoza, Ipanema 6 roll, yakisoba with chicken, and Tataki ternera, which was slices of grilled beef. \u00a0I didn't realize that the restaurant was Japanese and Brazilian fusion, but what a tasty treat! \u00a0We also ordered two desserts: the caramilho and the chocolate petropolis, which both ended the meal perfectly.Great food! \u00a0Great service! \u00a0Fun atmosphere! \u00a0This is a wonderful place to go for a special occasion or to treat yourself. \u00a0I would definitely come back when I visit this fun and vibrant city!",
