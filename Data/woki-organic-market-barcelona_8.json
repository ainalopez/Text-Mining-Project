    "I haven't eaten here yet, but one thing that will keep me coming back is that they carry Celestial Seasonings herb teas - especially my favorite \"Sleepytime\". \u00a0Additionally, they sell brown/molasses sugar - which is something I use all the time in baking, yet can't seem to find at regular grocery stores. \u00a0They actually have a pretty good selection of imported foods that I'm used to using - items that are pantry staples according to some of my favorite (American) cookbooks... so, yeah - I'll swing by whenever i'm in the area just for their imports/specialty foods... maybe one of these days I'll actually lunch there.",
