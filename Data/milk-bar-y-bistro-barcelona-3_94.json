    "100% for tourists. We were craving an American style brunch, so we came here. Everything LOOKED amazing but tasted pretty bland. My salmon eggs benedict had no flavor, the pancakes tasted like the pre-made frozen kind and the French toast was just uninspired. The atmosphere was very charming and cute, but the food was pretty mediocre. \u00a0Not to mention we all got sick to our stomachs after brunch.",
