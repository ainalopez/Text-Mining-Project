    "Delicious food and very cheap prices. Me and my date had the chinese noodle soup and the fried dumplings for starters, really big portions (they only cost around 3 euros each). We chose the beef and onions (6 euros) and gambas a la plancha (7 euros) as main courses, and they were even better than our starters. We paid 27 euros in total, including drinks and rice, which you order separately. The restaurant isn't cosy, it's loud and big. Next time I go here it will defiently be with a group of friends. The other guests were mainly groups of people sharing food. We went there around 8.30 pm, at that time it was busy but they had free tables. When we left at around 10.00 pm, there were people waiting outside to get a table.",
