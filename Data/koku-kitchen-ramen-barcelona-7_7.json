    "We nipped in here for a nightcap and ended up having some kimchi and a dessert. Everything was lovely, the kimchi had just the right amount of punch. We didn't get to try the ramen but the place was packed and it was nearly 39 degrees outside so that's saying something.. We sat at the bar and chatted to the owner who is really friendly. Defo worth a visit especially in winter if you need to warm your cockles.",
