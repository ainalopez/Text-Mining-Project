    "We had dinner at Lasarte in a week long stay in Barcelona. \u00a0Hard to get a reservation! but well worth the wait. The food was amazing!!!! the wine even better. Great steak!!!This place was wayyyy better than French laundry in the states...Dinner was so great here that we called back about 10x to get back in for a 2nd time in the same week! So worth the price too!!!!",
