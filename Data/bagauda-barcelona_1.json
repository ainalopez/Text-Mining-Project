    "A little hole-in-the wall that seems to be wildly popular, Bagauda offers some excellent tapas options and cheap-yet-delicious wine.In this area of Barcelona you're overwhelmed by the variety and scope of tapas/wine bars, from local haunts to very touristy spots. Bagauda is somewhere in the middle, with an intimate restaurant space and English menus. If you can find a seat in the frequently crowded space, you'll find homemade tapas and the least expensive red Spanish wine I saw in Barcelona (2-3 euros and it's pretty darn good). Those tapas are also amazing, with house made with fresh ingredients and reasonable prices. The service is also exceptional - my girlfriend and I walked in 15 minutes before closing and allowed to stay another ten minutes after closure without any protest (they even offered to make us more).We had a wonderful time in Barcelona, in no small part because of wonderful eateries like Bagauda. If you want a personal intimate experience a little away from the tourist crowd (but still in English), Bagauda will more than satisfy.",
