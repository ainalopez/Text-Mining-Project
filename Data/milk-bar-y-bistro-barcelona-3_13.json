    "Cute casual spot that reminds us of home at a lesser price tag.We came on Tuesday for lunch and it was busy.The egg Benedict were just lovely.Although it could use a bit more flavoring.Husband choked down his salmon egg florentine in no time.Overall a good little spot with prompt service and decent price.",
