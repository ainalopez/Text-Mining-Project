    "Pizza is delicious. Worth the wait, yes it takes a long time but good food takes time. Staff is really friendly and keeps your beer full. I went expecting to eat half a pizza and take the rest back to hotel for lunch tomorrow, but so good I ate it all. I would have given 5 stars but unlike the yelp info states, they do not take credit cards only cash.",
