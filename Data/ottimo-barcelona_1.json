    "wonderful little place we stumbled upon after a mediocre tapas dinner in the same plaza. great variety, prices were moderate, portions were generous, staff was friendly, but what has us returning (me willing to take the time write a review) was the quality. just amazing, up there with some that i've had in italy. not much indoor seating but hey it's barcelona! the plaza it sits in is shaded and perfect for people watching. a slight queue the two occasions i've been there, but the staff is pretty fast about servicing the customers and are patient as people make their selections.",
