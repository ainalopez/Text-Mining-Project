    "GET HERE EARLY. That's pretty much the only major suggestion I can give. I got to Bo de B about 10 minutes before opening and there was still a small queue in front of me for these delicious sandwiches. By the time it had opened, the queue was halfway down the street!They try their best to get their bocadillos done quickly though without sacrificing on flavour and service. If you tell the lovely woman serving up that it's your first time she'll give you recommendations on what tastes best with the meat you chose. I chose beef and MY was it good. Expect loads for your money, they give you a good amount of meat and pile the lovely crusty baguette high with all the veg you could want, and for less than 4\u20ac it's well worth the wait.",
