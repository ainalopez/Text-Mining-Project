    "Order anything but the Eggs Benedict and you'll be happy. They offer generous portions, friendly service, GREAT Coffee and an inviting, relaxing dining room but my meal seemed to lack something. \u00a0For an establishment to be called Benedict's, I'd expect stellar Eggs Benedicts....That was not the case here. \u00a0The Hollandaise sauce on the Eggs Benedict seems prebottled and was missing that tangy lemony flavor. Its a true shame because their generous portions would have been welcomed if I loved my food.Barcelona is an Amazing place for Foodies and I wouldn't care to \u00a0use one of my meals on a mediocre plate.",
