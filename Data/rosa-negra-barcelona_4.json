    "Bravo! We travel full time & love Mexican food because of the healthy veggies, whole beans & chicken (mostly). \u00a0We haven't found Mexican food since we left \u00a0California 95 days ago, so when we saw this Mexican restaurant in Barcelona, we had to try it....and what a treat! \u00a0The ceviche & the schrimp cocktail were both wonderfully fresh; the (cheap) margaritas were good & not short on tequila; and the chicken mole was terrific - and we REALLY like good mole.We are in Barcelona for just 5 days, but will have one more dinner at Rosa's before we leave.",
