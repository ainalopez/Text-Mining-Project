    "The food and service here was absolutely excellent!The owners are a husband & wife team who really care and see to it that you have a lovely dining experience. \u00a0I ducked in to escape from the rain, not intending on having a meal - but the menu looked so good - I decided to have the menu del dia. \u00a0The tomato & feta salad was drizzled with infused oils - (one was a kalamata/tapenade), and sprinkled with herbs - very flavorful, colorful and tasty.The steak tartare was served with thinly sliced baguette toasts, and the dessert of poached pear in a wine reduction was fabulous.with a bottle of water, glass of tinto & and coffee - at 20 bucks, it felt like a bargain - even though it was a total splurge. \u00a0my mum & my aunts and cousins have been coming here for years, and they've always loved it. \u00a0I can earnestly say that this was one of my favorite meals here in Barcelona.",
