    "Delightful! \u00a0The old-world feel, the bilingual staff and the local wine made a superb start to a wonderful evening. \u00a0We arrived there early on a week night \u00a0around 7pm so we were able to get a table. \u00a0Thank you Yelp reviewers for recommending the goat cheese and red peppers. \u00a0I am so jealous that Barcelona peppers are better than what we can get at home. \u00a0 A great value and wonderful experience.",
