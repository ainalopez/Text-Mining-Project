    "Lovely dining experience in the Eixample. \u00a0How could those deep fried artichokes be so light? \u00a0The scampi risotto so flavorful? \u00a0The stuffed chicken was right on Christmas point with a beautiful prune, apple, raisin compote. \u00a0And lavender ice cream for dessert was a wonderful final note. \u00a0Staff recommended wine paired perfectly and was perfectly poured throughout our two hour lunch. \u00a0How much fun to watch the kitchen staff prepare the dishes! \u00a0Every staff member was so gracious and always smiling - really looked like they were enjoying their opportunity to host diners. \u00a0This restaurant sets an incredibly high bar. \u00a0Looking forward to our next visit.",
