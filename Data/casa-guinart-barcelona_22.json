    "my husband and i stumbled in here when we couldn't figure out where to go... and took a chance on something that had no reviews on yelp -- and we are so happy we did! \u00a0The waiters and chefs were all so friendly and accommodating, we sat at the bar and saw all of our food being made and were able to ask questions about ingredients and for what the chef would recommend. \u00a0We ended up getting almost half the menu and everything was an absolute delight! \u00a0We loved the paella and sardines the most, but i seriously wish i could have just kept eating and tried everything. \u00a0Don't pass this place up! \u00a0They are actually an extension from the original Casa Guinart that offers cooking classes where are impossible to get in to (would love to try to next time i'm in Spain).",
