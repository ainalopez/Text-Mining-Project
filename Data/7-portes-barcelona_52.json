    "One of the most memorable parts of my trip in Spain. Our (bf & I) taxi driver actually recommended this place to us so major shoutout to him lol! This restaurant is right on the beach and is pretty big. It deff has a prime location. The interior also has an upscale casual vibe which was pretty nice. But really, THE FOOD IS SO AMAZING ALBXOWNSNGU. The gazpacho we were served is still one of the best I've tried. The chicken croquettes were also so creamy and flavorful. We then ordered squid ink seafood paella and a regular paella (I know, we're beasts :P). Fiiiinally I was able to say that I had the opportunity to try delicious paella in it's native country. we also downed a pitcher of sangria, which was a bad choice because by the end of the meal we felt (and looked) like fattened, drunken, happy fools",
