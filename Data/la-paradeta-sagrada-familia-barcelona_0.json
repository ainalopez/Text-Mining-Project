    "Don't wast your time reading the reviews, grab your lady and head on to this place, it wont dissapoint, unless you hate seafood, then, well, you suck at living.Let's put it this way, The copious amount of fresh seafood would make Anthony Bourdain wetter than a stadium full of highschool girls at a One Direction Concert.Thru Out our lives we had amazing seefod(naturally from Portugal, close to the coast where high quality seafood is a common thing), but this was some of the most amazing seafood I had. The place is by no means fancy, it is a place were you go to overindulge in what best comes out of the sea, so you will use your hands and fingers like a savage. Don't worry, no one will care, everyone will be busy stuffing their face on this deliciousness.For starters we had a few Oysters which were more than amazing(even though I'm not the biggest oyster fan), then came in the Razor Clams, drop dead delicious. The the small clams came in next and while we were munching on those, the baby octopus, giant shrimps and the monkfish all with the house garlic, olive oil and herbs sauce drizzled on top. At some point felt like I was doing da nasty with Poseidon himself on the sandy beaches of Atlantida.We had some magnificent Muguet white wine, while delicious in itself, we were pretty much occupied with the food. Over ordering bread was a great idea because we got to dip it into the sweet sweet bukake of the baby octopus and shrimps and the garlic aioli. 7/5 would visit again.",
