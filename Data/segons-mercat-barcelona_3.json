    "One of my must-go places on all of my - so far - seven visits to Barcelona, and still the restaurant where we always start our visit. Food is great, perhaps a bit posher than your ordinary tapas joint on the corner but still not over the top. Seating is more of a restaurant-type of setting but the menu is mostly tapas and service is very quick. Dining with kids is no problem either.The menus on the blackboards are in Spanish and Catalan but they do have an English menu too, although they don't speak much English.",
