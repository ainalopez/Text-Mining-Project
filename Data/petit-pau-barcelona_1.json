    "This place was recommended, and we walked in without a reservation--and lucked out. Or, as the owner put it, \"had a flower in our bottom\". We did, indeed, as this tiny place has but five tables and apparently books months in advance. Someone had cancelled, however, and we got in.Best meal of our entire trip. The owner spoke perfect English (and French!), explained everything on the menu, and everything we ordered was fantastic--from the cava right to the dessert. The prices were reasonable, too -- I was expecting luxury prices, but the meal for two (with appetizers, dessert, and a bottle of cava in addition to the main course) cost us about 80\u20ac. My advice? If you're planning a trip to Barcelona, make a reservation well in advance. You won't regret it.",
