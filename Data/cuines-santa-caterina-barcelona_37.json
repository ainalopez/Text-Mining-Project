    "This was one of our best meals in Spain so far! We loved it and even though it says not good for kids we managed to go with 4 kids under 5. My favorite dish was the Raviolis de Zetas (Mushroom) - Delicious! Although my friend couldn't get enough of the Baby Squid Salad with Beans. The gyoza was good there as well.",
