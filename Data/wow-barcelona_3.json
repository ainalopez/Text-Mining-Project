    "I knew it had to exist... a place for a kick-ass salad. \u00a0I was gonna go for their namesake \"wow\" salad, but opted for the goat cheese salad instead. \u00a0 for 8 euros, you get a nice big bowl of mixed greens (i couldn't even finish it) with two big slices of goat cheese, sliced apples, and walnuts - with a mustard based dressing. They also have tapas and sandwiches, but i was thrilled at the prospect of a good salad. \u00a0I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but i'm so over meat at this point.a meal without jamon or pork of any sort. \u00a0wonderful!",
