    "Bormuth is a pretty busy restaurant, with a good mix of both young locals and tourists. My boyfriend and I ended up eating at Bormuth twice during our stay, as one of the nights we were in town was a Monday and most everything else was closed that evening. The ambiance is pretty trendy so if you're trying to keep to an \"old world Spain\" type of experience you might not find that here. After going two nights in a row I definitely can say that the food and service is solid, and worth checking out if you want some good tapas.We ordered:+ Calamari - Lightly battered, and extra tender... It seems like Spain gets the Calamari right almost everywhere.+ Aubergine - Crispy fried eggplant chips lightly fried and tossed in a honey/balsamic drizzle type of deal, so good! + Ensaladilla Rusa - tasty, but not enough picos :(+ Lentils - after two weeks in Spain we were dying for something light and not fried.. thank heavens for this salad!+ Albondigas - another yummy dish you can't go wrong with. I also recommend trying their vermouth either red or white, the preparation was different from how I'm used to having it in the states (as mixers in a manhattan or martini) but it was good, cheap and interesting to try none-the-less. Also worth mentioning that at the end of our meal they brought the check out with some kind of delicious complimentary shooter. What a night!",
