    "Recommended by our airbnb host, we visited la pepita twice in five days. Great atmosphere, lovely people, and outstanding tapas. We ordered a few at a time and tried much of the menu over our two visits. Loved every single item and I'm still thinking about it. Do not hesitate, worth the wait.",
