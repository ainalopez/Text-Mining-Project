    "Solid tapas with some innovative twists. \u00a0We got there early (8:00 PM) and the highly attentive service did wane some as other diners started pouring in. \u00a0We sat at the communal table and had a great dinner with our kids in an atmosphere that still made us feel like we were having an evening out. \u00a0Glad we ordered desert as they were some of the best tapas of the night.",
