    "By far the best tapas in Barcelona. \u00a0We were in the City for four days and made a rezy @9pm for anem de tapas and good thing because the crowd outside waiting was large. \u00a0The fact this place is frequented by locals says it all. \u00a0Every dish we tried was outstanding in freshness and flavor. \u00a0Pic of specials that evening attached.",
