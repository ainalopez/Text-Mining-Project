    "Recommended by a friend who recently moved to Barcelona. We had a great long lunch here after a little bit of search to find the place, it's in quiet little street in the middle of town. You just knew it was going to be cool when you walk through the entrance, straight into the kitchen! Which you by-pass before being seated.Excellent Mediterranean cuisine, with very prompt and pleasant service. There is a Japanese spot downstairs which didn't look half as good. Fresh fish, amazing oysters, and a lovely vegetable risotto. Halfway through lunch the roof opened, to let the sun and fresh air on a hot day in. Impressive. A beautiful local white wine made it all the more enjoyable.Would recommend.",
