    "I've got to back to Barcelona for this steak and foie gras. Rich, buttery, delicate goodness. Don't get me wrong, the bravas, croquettes, and smoked salmon are delicious, but it is this dish that will keep me awake dreaming. My husband and I split a steak and all the other dishes noted above. The price can't be beat for what is vying for first place in mind for the best steak of our trip! Service is authentic and efficient. Admiral was actually nice, which isn't always the case in Barcelona. Cheers!",
