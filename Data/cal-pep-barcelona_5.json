    "WOW do not leave here without drinking a full bottle of 12.50 euro wine, razor clams, calamari and STEAK. The steak with some sort of scalloped potatoes was incredible and the monkfish made me want to cry it was such a beautifully buttered whitefish. Great service but we waited in line for an hour on a rainy Friday afternoon for lunch. If you are four or nor you can make a reservation in the back room but the bar is fun too because you can watch the chefs. What a meal!",
