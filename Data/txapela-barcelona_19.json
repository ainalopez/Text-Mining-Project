    "One of the best tapas places in Barcelona. A bit high priced but a very good experience for the people that want to have authentic tapas. The ones with the small bread \"pinchos\" not the portions. Sangria is mediocre. You can sit outside where they have about 10 tables or inside (two floors)",
