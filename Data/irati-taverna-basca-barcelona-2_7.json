    "I don't believe love is too strong a word to express how I felt about this little stand-up toothpick pintxos bar. I enjoyed the food so much I forgot I was standing the entire time, nearly an possible feat but it actually is true!Each and every toothpick pintxos I tried was perfectly presented and delectable, most on a sliver of fresh bread which was incredibly easy to eat & share. Knowing each toothpick would be totaled at the end for 1,95 euro each felt like an amazing bargain considering the quality of what was in front of me. We followed our friend's recommendation and secured a spot toward the end of the bar closest the kitchen so we'd have early options on the hot presentations as they came out of the kitchen. The hot pintxos proved to be my personal favorites. All were explained by the staff in perfect English both from our bartender on the cold presentations and the lady arriving from the kitchen with the hot ones. No guess work involved! Enjoyed with a glass of cava & a beer for my husband with multiple pintxos shared between us. Perfection!",
