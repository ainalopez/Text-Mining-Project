    "I hate to give Wow a bad review, as I really hoped it would be better based on the reviews. We ordered a few sandwiches, bravas and fried chicken, but none of it was anything to write home about. Good prices on Estrella Damn, however. The two stars comes from the bartender, who was nice at first, but once we were done, spent 30 minutes talking to his friend instead of checking on us. Wouldn't waste my time there again.",
