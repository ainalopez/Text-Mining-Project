    "Not sure what all the fuss is about!I came here and it was way over crowded, I waited and waited for my table.The food was just ok. Nothing amazing, nothing horrible except for the greek salad.I ordered a greek salad and it was just bland feta, basically a cheese salad! thats not a greek salad!! We ordered the mini burger and wow they where mini, never seen such small burgers and they where about 4 euros for one and very oily- nothing specialhonestly I'm a bit confused about what all the hoopla is about! nothing to write home about or go out of your way for. Average tapas and the flan like desert was average too.",
