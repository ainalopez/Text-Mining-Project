    "For the money, this place is more than adequate for a meal. You can get a full plate of food and a glass of house wine for around 8 euros. Three and a half stars.Keep in mind, nothing here will knock your socks off, but if you need a place to take the family or grab a heartier (lots of beef here) meal and a beer, this place Will fit the bill. I had the hamburger steak, as well as the vegetable pasta. Both dishes came out quickly and the service was good. The pasta was only ok, while the hamburger steak was better.",
