    "A couple friends and I had this for lunch yesterday, and I could not have asked for a better experience. Their menu for the day allows you 3 choices of tapas with a drink and bread and dessert included. The food was beyond delicious and the menu was so affordable (12\u20ac for all of that food!)",
