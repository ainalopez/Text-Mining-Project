    "This was hands down the best meal we had in Barcelona. \u00a0The place is charming with an old world feel. Quiet and casual. We sat for two hours without being rushed. The grilled octopus was out of this world - so tender and fresh. The charcuterie mix was huge for the price and delicious. I wish we could keep coming back to try everything on the menu.",
