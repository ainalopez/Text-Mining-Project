    "There were 3 of us and we went for an early dinner. \u00a0Somewhere around 8pm. \u00a0The wait wasn't too long before we were seated. \u00a0It's a very small tapas place, but it gave us an opportunity to meet this sweet couple from Australia. \u00a0When we walked in we saw some tapas that interested us then we also ordered off the menu. \u00a0We ordered a few from the bar area.Potatoes with sausageOlives with AnchoviesWe also ordered the HamManchego CheeseSpanish Tortillaand the House Cava of course. \u00a0Great time at a great restaurant.",
