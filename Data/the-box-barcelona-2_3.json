    "This was a really cool restaurant in the Gothic District of Barcelona. The place had tons of different type/flavours of booze on the wall. Cool look. The hot dog was good but not great. It has the capability to be GREAT however. The menu was designed that you can create any type of hot dog you'd like. I'd go back & give it a try but I'd be more clear on what I wanted to be on my Dog.",
