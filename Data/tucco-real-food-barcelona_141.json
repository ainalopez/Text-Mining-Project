    "Definitely didn't come to Barcelona expecting my favorite restaurant to be an Italian/Argentinian steakhouse, but wow. This place is amazing. Stumbled upon this place while wandering through El Gotic, and I'm glad we did. Reasonable prices all around. I had the ham, cheese and olive empanadas to start and they were astounding. At this point, I moved on to ricotta, spinach and pine nut ravioli and again, my mind was completely blown. For desert, GO FOR THE DULCE DE LECHE CAKE. No question, the hands down winner among my family. I will be back a few times during my stay here.One more note...the quality of the food is 5 stars, but I'd rate the service here even higher if I could, especially that of the owner. Co-owned by him and his brother, you can really tell that they care about the food they put out and the customers they serve. Tucco Real Food - I'll be back.",
