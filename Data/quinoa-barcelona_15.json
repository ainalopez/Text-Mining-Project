    "Delicious little caf\u00e9 in Barcelona that absolutely shouldn't be missed if you're vegan or vegetarian. Or just straight up like eating vegetables every once in a while. There's a set menu as well as a daily menu - which includes everything from wine and coffee and smoothies to sandwiches and salads and dessert. Portions are not huge, but filling (+ insanely affordable). And everything is made to order (by the owner himself) making it a winner in my book.There are only three tables and a few seats at the bar, so I imagine the restaurant fills up quickly around lunch time. We came around 2 and had no problems catching a seat.BONUS: There's free wifi and the space is straight up gorgeous. Minimal decor with rustic vibes. Definitely worth wandering out of the main part of the city to dine at this place.",
