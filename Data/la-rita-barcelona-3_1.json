    "Very good lunch and tons of food for \u20ac10.85 fixed price menu. We got there right at 13:00 when it opened and snagged a table for 2 close to the window. Had to wait a several minutes while it seemed the locals were helped and got bread and orders in first. For the first course were a delicious white Catalan bean dish with sausage and a excellent rigatoni carbonara with small chunks of jamon - more like an Alfredo than carbonara but still good and both first courses would have been a whole meal at most spots in the US. Second course of baked bream (the whole enchilada fish!!) with potatoes and peppers was very good, mild fish and perfectly done (I love my seafood but get a little turned off by the whole thing) as well as a pork tenderloin which was pretty tough and in a brown gravy with bland white rice. Chicken next table looked like a better choice. Desserts were a cream Catalan, seemed a little heavy on the egg, along with profiteroles with a dark chocolate sauce - a good choice. Came with bread and a 1/4 liter wine each. So quite a few pluses, only one fairly major minus, but overall thumbs up and an equivalent amount of food anywhere else would have been $25 or more.",
