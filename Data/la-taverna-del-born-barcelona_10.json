    "A wonderful place for a delicious meal in an excellent location. I only had the Tapas, and mostly for the Croquetas (which were the best I've tasted in my life), but from the dishes I saw, it all looked great. Agreed. Outside seating, Pescaditos Fritos, Patatas Bravas. These are musts. Prices were reasonable. I happened to eat here my last day in Barcelona the other week and it was certainly a good place to end on. I'll give it 5 stars when I go back and try more things. I will be going back there.",
