    "Easily accessible off of the most touristy section of Barcelona (Las Ramblas) I was a bit skeptical, but this street (Pintor Fortuny) is quite the gold mine and Bar Lobo is no slump. \u00a0After brunch and a wander through the Raval a couple of friends and I weren't ready to go home so we stopped into Bar Lobo for a couple of cortados and a slice of chocolate cake to split. \u00a0The cake was absolutely delicious; dense and rich to the extreme. \u00a0I have since returned to sit in the cushy banquettes along the window to read a book and have another dessert which was also quite nice. \u00a0The space is large and the lighting is great, interesting design and a great mix of internationals and a few locals as well. \u00a0Prices are a little expensive but this isn't a bad spot to unwind or chat with friends, the food is better than average (and the desserts are great) and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable. \u00a0The music is also up my alley (Electric Guest, Cat Empire and more). \u00a0Good stuff!",
