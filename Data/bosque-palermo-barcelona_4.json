    "Delicious paella with rich spices! They have quite a few varieties, seafood, meat, vegetable etc. I tried meat paella for the first time here and it's really good! The rice is a bit al dente (firm). According to locals, it's the authentic way of making it. I personally like fully cooked rice though... Their house wine is quite good! Definitely recommend a copa.",
