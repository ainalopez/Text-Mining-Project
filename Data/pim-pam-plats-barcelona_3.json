    "Don't expect the ritz here in terms of where you will have your food, but you can look forward to \u00a0a pretty bloody good burger.Pim Pam is nothing blush looking but who cares. You can watch the slightly grumpy staff maker your burger and fries and don't have to wait more than 15 mins for it to be ready. Fries were amazing - thin and crispy, huge portion and I loved them.Burger choices are good as there are several options. I had the veal three cheese burger and it was awesome. \u00a0I also got to try the chicken burger and it was lovely. Great burgers and fries - big portions - good prices. \u00a0Give It a try.",
