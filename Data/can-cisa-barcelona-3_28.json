    "I was hungry... 8 hours on a plane, 3 hours on a train, no sleep hungry. I ordered 5 dishes. The burrata was good but it lacked a touch of seasoning, and maybe some good olive oil or an aged balsamic. The foie gras terrine tasted a bit like store-bough. The star was the roasted pumpkin... seriously, it was damn good! Would I come back to this place just for the pumpkin though? Unfortunately not.",
