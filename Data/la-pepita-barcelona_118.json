    "Certainly worth the rave reviews. We heard about this place from new friends we met at a winery in another part of Spain. Needless to say it was worth the trip. We wound up eating there twice, the service and food were excellent. \u00a0We spoke to the owner Sofia the first night and said we'd be back. When we returned, she remembered that I'd asked if they would do a tasting menu style meal. She then proceeded to set us up with an 8 dish meal with wine and for a very modest price. Overall we had 14 dishes total including three desserts, with the highlights being the anchovies in olive sauce, the ham and cheese with truffle sauce and their clever play on bruscetta (melon on top looks like tomato and the \"bread\" is tomato). Also of note is their \"Marvellous Gin and Tonic. \u00a0It'll be the beat you ever had.",
