    "When I went on a late Sunday night I saw that they had a regular menu but they only offered pinchxtos, which are similar to tapas. All were \u20ac1.70 and most were delish. Very high quality. Lots with seafood. 5 filled me up. The ambiance is nice & it's a pretty swanky place with outdoor seating & a lower floor with more seating. The place was spotless & busy. New pinchxtos come out all the time. Staff was friendly. It's right next to the a Gaudi cathedral so great location to stroll after dinner. If every sniffle one would've been great I would've given 5 starts.",
