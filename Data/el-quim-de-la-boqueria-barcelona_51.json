    "This was one of my favorite meals in Barcelona. It's a challenge to gfet a seat, but definitely worth the effort. The food was excellent, though I was sorry we didn't get the baby squids -- everything looked delicious. Across the board, I was surprised how expensive everything was compared to my last trip to Spain (9 years ago). I think lunch for 2 cost about $80, more expensive than I would have guessed, but well worth it. Would return.",
