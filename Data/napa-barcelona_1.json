    "Great find , we walked in without reservations and they promptly accommodated us. I informed the waitress that I am gluten free and she kindly helped me pick a few items that were GF. And we were not disappointed , the food was amazing, even better than some meals I have had in \u00a0Napa, California .Everything was innovative with interesting twist of the mainstream meals . Highly recommend taco with sushi rice and chimichurri and guacamole with yuca and plantain chips",
