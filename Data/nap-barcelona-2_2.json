    "One of the best crusts I have ever tasted. \u00a0Yes, I just said that. \u00a0Beware, they serve their pizzas uncut. \u00a0Not sure why, but no one seemed to mind. \u00a0Truly delicious food served with great love and pride. \u00a0I am still thinking about that crust. . \u00a0. \u00a0Be prepared for a wait, but tables turn over very quickly.",
