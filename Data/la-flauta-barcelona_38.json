    "We do a lot of research on restaurants when we travel and are loving that Yelp is making its way around Europe, to guide us to more local restaurants. \u00a0We hate landing in tourist traps so we were so happy that a friend who lives in Barcelona told us about La Flauta and Yelp confirmed her recommendation.We tried to book a table but they only reserve tables for larger groups. \u00a0we ere told that if we get there between 8-830, we would have no problem. We arrived around 830 and got one of the last tables. \u00a0 We loved everything we ordered including the sangria blanca. \u00a0I don't think you can go wrong. We asked our waiter for some recommendations and everything he suggested was excellent. \u00a0The beef with pimientos on top were to die for as was the egg and shredded potato dish. \u00a0We loved the asparagus and mushrooms and the croquettes and the Jamon was yummy--especially paired with the egg/potato dish.The atmosphere is bustling and fun and the service is fast. \u00a0We felt like we didn't hold back on food or drink and the bill was very reasonable!!",
