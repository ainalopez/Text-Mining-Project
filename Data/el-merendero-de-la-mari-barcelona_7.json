    "Fabulous restaurant for the local fods. We ate fideua which is a typical dish of vermicelli pasta that is browned,then cooked with a light tomato fish sauce...served with aoili which you mix right in and it makes the dish burst with flavor..I also tasted my daughter's paella....the best I have ever eaten. They even had English menus here for those without a fabulous tour guide who translates everything for you. The decor was cozy and warm, waitstaff seemed friendly....I didnt understand them but they spoke with a nice tone :)",
