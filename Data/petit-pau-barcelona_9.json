    "This place stands out for its service. \u00a0The food is incredible (see other reviews) at the price point Expect (35-40 Eur per person), and I have placed it very close behind Somodo (Barcelona) the king in my quality to price ratio ranking. \u00a0The unbelievable thing about El Petit Pau is that on top of a wonderful meal you get incredible service, something often overlooked in Spain. \u00a0The cuisine is textbook local, so it it is a very good choice for foreigners wanting to get a top notch taste of Catalan food without breaking the bank. \u00a0They take reservations only and expect a month wait for weekend dining, 2 weeks for weekdays, and one week for weekday lunch. \u00a06 pax max, but preferred 2-4.",
