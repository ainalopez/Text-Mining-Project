    "Quote from their website: \"CDLC in Barcelona is the finest club in Spain and one of the best in the world\".Not my impression last night. The music was decent and consistent to my previous experience but the place was far from \"finest\", from sloppy drunks bumping people and spilling drinks to a few \"classy\" people sleeping for at least a couple of hours on the beds in their VIP section that didn't look Very Important at all, haha!My recommendation for the website:\"CDLC in Barcelona is the finest dive in Spain and one of the best in the world to get shit-faced and pass out while still feeling important\".",
