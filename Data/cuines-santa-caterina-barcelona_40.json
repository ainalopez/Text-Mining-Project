    "Date of Visit: 5/17/11Short Story: Great food, diverse menu from hand ground sausage to tempura and gnochi Tapas.Atmosphere: Casual and just bit upscale, but not stuffy (think Houston's in US).Highly recommended.Long Story: Located just on the edge of the Bari Gotic in Barcelona, Cuines Santa Caterina is an upscale Tapas restaurant that feels more Californian than Spanish.I say this because when eating at European restaurants there is usually a single-mindedness to the menus (i.e. French is French, Spanish is Spanish). \u00a0That said, I have to say the diversity in the Tapas menu at Cuines may be their strength.If you have a reservation you can get a table (and believe me, reservations are mandatory, this place gets packed). Or you can sit at the long bar that overlooks the open kitchen.Since we didn't have reservations, we went for the bar and found it a great experience. Highly Recommended.",
