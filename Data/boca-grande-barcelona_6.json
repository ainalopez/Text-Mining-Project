    "I went to Boca Chica, the lounge/bar of Boca Grande. The entire establishment has a chic and trendy feel. Music is on every level including the floor where the bathroom is. There were people using bathroom area as a place to socialize and dance to the music which I thought was pretty cool. I had a generous plate of pasta with truffle and asparagus which was tasty. Most of the service staff was incredibly accommodating. The music was remixes of 90s hits, but the vibe was still cool. If I lived in Barcelona, I'd frequent this place regularly.",
