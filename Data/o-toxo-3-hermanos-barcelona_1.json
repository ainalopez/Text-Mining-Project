    "SO good, that I visited 3 times in a single week! This is a casual spot in the El Raval neighborhood that locals as well as \"in the know\" tourists frequent. \u00a0Everything on the menu that we had was delicious, and you can choose from tapas or a larger size portion (ration). \u00a0We tried the pulpo (octopus), razor clams, mussels, the tomato bread, clams in green sauce, snails. \u00a0And the wine selection...don't get me started! \u00a0An amazing bottle of Rioja for 9 Euros...makes you feel like a jerk for paying $40 for a bottle of wine in NY! The service was excellent and they spoke English well enough to get the job done! \u00a0Absolutely worth the visit :-)",
