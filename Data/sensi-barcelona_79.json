    "Was in Barcelona for a week and this was the best restaurant experience we had, hands down. Music was great, ambiance was great, food was ridiculous... This is a hole in the wall you don't want to miss. In fact, we had such a good experience we came back the next night! The beer battered sausages are incredible, and I'm not really into sausage. Had so many different things on the menu and they were all legitimately incredible. Oh, and if you want some red wine, get the Prezo, only around 16\u20ac a bottle and was also some of the best wine we had during our stay. Seriously loved this place.",
