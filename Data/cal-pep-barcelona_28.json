    "Halfway through our meal at Cal Pep, my husband turned to me and said \"This is the meal we'll be talking about after our trip.\" He was right. We waited an hour for our seat which wasn't too terrible. At least it gave us time to consider what we wanted to order. Once we sat down, we requested the tortilla trampera, tuna tartare, clams and the pimientos de padr\u00f3n plus a bottle of white wine. Everything was brought out quickly and mostly one by one with a side of pan con tomate. The experience of sitting at the bar with everyone, watching the cooks at the grill and waiters bustling by with food for everyone was fabulous. Eventually, at the recommendation of the waiter, we also ordered the cuttlefish which was good. The best, of course, was the tortilla. For dessert we had the crema catalana which was disappointing but then went for round two which was the pastry dish everyone else seemed to be having. Delicious. We finished off our meal with a dessert wine and then pretended not to care when our large, pricey bill arrived. If we make it back to Barcelona, we'll definitely be visiting Cal Pep again.",
