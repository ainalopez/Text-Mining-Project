    "The food is just amazing and super delicious. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed being there as the atmosphere is just chilled out and cool. I didn't feel the prices were expensive, it's reasonable for what it was. We had a couple of tapas and all of them were just great. I'd recommend the chicken and the squid. Both were so good I wanted to cry. As a dessert I'd recommend the Creme Catalonia, that was just perfect.One thing I'd mention to the staff: whisky is never served in a shot glass. I understand that not many order whisky anyway but I think I should mention that for the future ;-)",
