    "The Bar Celta Pulperia was recommended to us by a couple we met in Avignon. \u00a0Went for lunch yesterday. \u00a0Had octopus Galician style, grilled baby octopus, and razor clams. \u00a0All were delicious. \u00a0Also, took a tour of the bar's draft beers and sangria...each was a perfect accompaniment for the food. \u00a0The waiter was particularly helpful teaching this gringo all things octopi. \u00a0Great local place in a city overrun with tourist-oriented restaurants/cafes.",
