    "We went recently to celebrate a birthday and couldn't have had a better experience. The place is small and well decorated with great service. We let the server choose what we ordered and he brought us about 15 rounds of delicious food. The Burrata Mozarrella was some of the best I have ever had, and the scallops and prawns were incredible. As a pescetarian, I didn't get to try the meat but everyone at the table was raving that it was some of the best ham, lamb, and pig they had ever had. Will definitely be back, even if it's just for the scallops.",
