    "Love the food and the atmosphere. The chef personally came out and explained all the dishes and gave us several complimentary to try. The quality of the food was excellent with a homie feeling. I have been in Barcelona for over 4 weeks and this was the first time I have had food that was close to home cooked. Love it and recommend it to all.",
