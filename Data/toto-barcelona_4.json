    "We went here our first night in Barcelona. We started out with a few tapas that were tasty but not memorable. The most memorable dish I had was the lamb which was absolutely scrumptious. Our waiter was a bit dingy and brought us olives instead of what we had ordered. I would definitely recommend but wouldn't go if you had few nights in the city.",
