    "Having only been to a few tapas bars in Barcelona, you can take this with a grain of salt, but my travel companion and I thought this place was excellent. Only \u20ac1 for each toothpick and they're constantly rotating the plates so everything stays fresh. We were really pleased with the selection and they offered multiple desserts on toothpicks as well!",
