    "The ExperienceWas in town for the weekend and found Brunch & Cake on Yelp. It had good reviews and the food looked good. When I arrived to the restaurant, there were 10 people waiting outside. There was a friendly woman taking reservations and I asked her the wait time. She said 15-20 minutes, so I put my name on the list for 1 person. 40 minutes later, I got an awkward table at the window. The chair was too high for the table, so I couldnt get as close as I wanted to. 10 minutes later, two group sat at the surrounding tables. A gentleman immediately took their order, but past me up. 20 minutes in, I had to ask the receptionist to take my order, which she happily did. The FoodI ordered the waffle eggs benedict with turkey and a chai latte. The chai arrived in a big mug that was full of milk, with a tea bag hanging off the side. No goodThe waffle benedict arrive luke warm/cold, with an overly sugary waffle. The eggs we cooked to my liking and the turkey was nothing to write home about. There was a mini salad with hazelnut that I found delicious.OverallThis was a bad experience for me. I usually can see the bright side in things, but this was ridiculous. Although the place was cute, the food from other tables looked great, I would not recommend this place.",
