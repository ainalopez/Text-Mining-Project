    "Seriously, how adorable is this place?! I know brunch isn't really a thing in Spain, but I'm so glad that this place exists.My partner and I stumbled on this place while searching Yelp reviews and figured we should give it a try.We brunch all the time on the weekends, and I have to say that we've been doing it wrong for so long ... Eating here, now this is how you brunch!One, this place is located in such a quaint, beautiful area, so you should definitely eat outside if you can. We actually got to sit in the cozy terrace seats. Second, the drinks \u00a0were really delicious. My chai was wonderful. The food was amazing too. They have such unique food items. I got a quinoa egg scramble with pretzel buns that had brie and golden onions and strawberries! Also, the presentation was beautiful!Lastly the service was great, though they were extremely busy, they were still kind and attentive.I highly recommend this place.",
