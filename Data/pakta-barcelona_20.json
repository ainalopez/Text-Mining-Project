    "Sounds like Pakta has got a lot of press and buzz since it opened. Usually I would consider that a bad sign (indeed, wasn't too impressed with 41 Grados the day after). But in fact this place is easily one for the most creative, top kitchens in Spain at the moment (or at least was in June). Had just as much fun here as at Quique Dacosta, for instance, and more enjoyable dishes in total.Also impressive was the command of Japanese technique, ingredients and flavours. Less than a decade ago we were eating soy-glazed duck and salads served with chopsticks as the height of Asian fusion in restaurants like Mugaritz. Now Pakta turns out better Japanese than found in other centres known for Japanese food like Vancouver. Definitely a must try.",
