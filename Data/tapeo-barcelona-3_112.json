    "Had a great experience. The waitress suggested a great wine, and the food was absolutely delightful. Will definitely pay another visit next time I come to Barcelona. If you make a reservation or come early at around 8pm for dinner, you will get a nice table, otherwise you have to sit by the bar.",
