    "We looked up this restaurant on Yelp and based on the rating we walked out of our way to visit. It was well worth the walk. From entering the restaurant everything was amazing. Their customer service and food were superior. The food was one of the best Italian meals have ever had include meals in Rome!! The prices were more than reasonable, 5 people including desert was 50 euro. \u00a0Don't miss this restaurant.",
