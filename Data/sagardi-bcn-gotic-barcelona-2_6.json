    "Delicious concept, where you can take a plate and choose every little pinxo that you want, and enjoy witha nice beer and then they count the toothpicks that were in them and you pay for them, just becareful because its more expensive if you sit outside and there is no description really of what you are eating, so dont be afraid to ask before you put it on the plate!",
