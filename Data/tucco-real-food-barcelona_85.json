    "This place was great. Great value for money and superbly cooked pastas. My kids have had a carbonara which was scrumptious and me and hubby have had a pasta free lasagna which was out of this world!!! Strongly recommended! And the service ..... Excellent! The very nice lady at the front was speaking a very good English and explained patiently all the dishes. Outstanding!!",
