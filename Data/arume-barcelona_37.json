    "First let's say that we would not have found the place without tripadvisor reviewer's postings and we are glad we did find it!!! What a GEMThe space is a cozy boutique restaurant, that I definitely suggest reservations. We went on a Sunday night and could barely get in. Once you arrive, you will receive very special attention to detail in all aspects: \u00a0food, service & presentation. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and makes you feel right at home. \u00a0We were seated promptly (because we had a reservation) and ordered the blackberry mojito as most reviewer's had recommended and the Chorizo taco tapas. OMG I don't think I have ever tasted anything so good as those tacos with the chipotle gourmaise on there. You must get this!! \u00a0We were given bread with olive oil and a bowl of green olives. The oil was provided in a clever way (In a corked test tube). The olives were average, we've had better in the southern part of Spain earlier on our vacation. Then we shared arroz con duck and was amazed at the flavor. The wait staff seemed surprised that we only ordered one entree to share. Glad we stuck with one entree as it turned out to be plenty. It was delightful and we left full between the starter and entree. I only posted one picture of the arroz con duck because I didn't see it on tripadvisor before so others may compare. We couldn't really post any other pictures to give an idea of the place other than what's on there already.",
