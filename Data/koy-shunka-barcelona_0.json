    "Great fun and very good food that does not disappoint. We've been twice, and the best experience was when there was just 2 of us and we sat at the bar. We could watch our food being prepared and was served it by the chef who prepared it. When we went as a 4, we were seated at a table away from the kitchen. There is a wide variety of Japanese food, but both times we selected the tasting menu option with the wagu option.",
