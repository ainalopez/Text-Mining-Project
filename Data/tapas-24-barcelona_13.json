    "Got a recommendation for this tapas place and went there one evening and saw the loooong line of people waiting and decided not to go... \u00a0 But tried again next day at 3 o'clock and only had to wait 15 minutes to get a table. The place looks like a cheap shawarma grill but I kinda liked it. The food was amazing but also very greasy and heavy - don't count your calories during your meal at Tapas 24! If the service was better I would have given the place 5 stars, but our waitress was a bit bossy and ordering food felt like a military bootcamp. Had the bomba, the bravas, fried chicken, fried ham, chicken and pork. For dessert lemon and chocolate.",
