    "This was hands-down the best meal I had in Barcelona. Such delicious food, and you get so much with the price! A meal comes with bread, empanadas, a main, a drink, and dessert. We got the pistachio ravioli and the vegetarian lasanga. They were both really delicious! I had the tiramisu for dessert, very tasty with more of a orange flavor than a coffee flavor.",
