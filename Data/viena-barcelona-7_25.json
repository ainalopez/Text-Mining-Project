    "This was our very first stop that we went to right after our plane landed at 9:30am after we got settled in our apartment. It is on the busy street of Las Ramblas. Husband and I ordered an espresso and a cafe con leche with one of the best ham sandwiches they offered. It was very good. The bread was toasted just right for it to have a very crispy and crunch to it as they rubbed fresh tomatoes on the bread served with Iberian ham. Very tasty.",
