    "My favourite Thai place in the city - 100% authentic. Be warned that this is a tiny bar converted into a restaurant, tables are tiny, it is very noisy as its always full house, and you would be smelling food being cooked the entire time, and also smell like food when you leave! But if you love Thai food and the real stuff, go for it. You'll definitely repeat :)",
