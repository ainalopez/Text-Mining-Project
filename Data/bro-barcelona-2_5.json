    "La Barceloneta is Barcelona's most famous fishermen neighbourhood, but now it can be also known by its Burgers. Located in the Baluard street, in front of the farmer Market, you can find Bro, a Burger restaurant run by some guys that know what they are doing. They hosted the December stop of the Yelp Burger tour, and we met there to get our burger fix. The local is relatively small, and I woud that they can host parties of 10 at the most. I ordered the Mexican burger. They are pretty quick cooking and serving (we were 12, and we got served in 15 min). I will speak of my burger, but I know the rest of the yelpers were pretty happy with theirs!. The Mexican comes with chipotle and guacamole, the patty and some vegetables. It was a delicious experience. You could feel the spiciness coming from the chipotle (When I order something that is supposed to be spicy, I like it spicy) and the guacamole brought the fruity flavour and the moist. As I said a delicious experience, and along being able to chat with my yelp fellows made a wonderful dinner. I'll be back.",
