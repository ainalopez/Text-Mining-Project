    "Some people are saying this is a divey bar? I don't agree with that. It is just a fun, relaxed, no frills type of establishment. The cava (get the pink!) is fricken amazing and at only $4euros/bottle, it can't be beat. We had a sausage sampler plate too with blood sausage, chorizo, etc. Delicious and fried up to order. Who needs forks when you have perfectly good toothpicks and fingers?!The servers/bartenders dont speak any English, which honestly, was great. Nice to get off the beaten path a little bit. We ended up getting several bottles of cava to go and took some back to the US to remind us of the awesome time we had here.",
