    "The first night we had din here, it was amazing! Service was excellent! We shared a few dishes, my friend had a salad with pears, arugula, and some sort of delicious creamy white cheese, i had a salad with tuna and olives, and we shared a creamy risotto with prawns. for dessert we had an apple tart of sorts, the tart looked flat, like a pancake and was absolutely divine! We tried the creme catalan, which our server couldn't describe to us, and that was heaven. \u00a0We also had a couple glasses of white wine, I forget what it was.The second time we had din here, i had french fries with a fried egg for my app (DELICIOUS), and the veal chop for my entree. The veal was super tough, and i was basically sawing on it for a long time, it was also very gristly. my friend had the chicken and said it was very good. \u00a0We had the apple tart dessert again, and it was still yummy. Sadface for the veal.We had chatted with one of the servers and he brought our some aperitifs for us, a liquer, Herbs de Galicia, which was super strong, but very refreshing. As I had mentioned earlier, service is excellent.The restaurant is very modern looking and chic.. There is a wine cellar downstairs that looks like an art fixture, and it's near the restroom. Restrooms in Spain always seem to be a hike, either way downstairs, or way upstairs.",
