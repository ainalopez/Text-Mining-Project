    "This review is only for the coffee. We got an Americano with milk on the side & a latte. Both were pretty darn tasty! I think a lot of it has to do with the creamy, delicious European milk that is not available in the States. For not having a drip option, the Americano really hit the spot. It was not watery or bland like the others I've had - perhaps it's the beans they use? It's more of a dark, smokey roast which is what I love.",
