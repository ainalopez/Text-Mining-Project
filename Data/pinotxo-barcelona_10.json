    "Near the front entrance of the La Boqueria outdoor covered market, you will find the Pinotxo Bar with counter seating and a few tables to the side. \u00a0It is busy all day, and historical server Juanito Bayen is at the front ready to serve you with a smile:worldsofflavorspain.com/\u2026 \u00a0Love him and love Pinotxo Bar! \u00a0I had the baby octopus over cannellini beans and a glass of cava for lunch, and it was so tasty, filling and perfect after a morning of shopping at the market and in the area. \u00a0I also took a selfie with Mr. Bayen! \u00a0He willingly takes pictures with his fans - so cute! \u00a0My friend and I went back another day for a couple glasses of cava after a morning at the beach - so perfect and relaxing with a gentle breeze flowing through the market. \u00a0I will always remember the charm of this place and the great service by Mr. Bayen and the rest of the bar crew.",
