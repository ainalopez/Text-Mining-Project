    "Delicious Churros!!This is a great pit stop whether you're on your way to visit La Sagrada Familia (which is literally 2 blocks away) or just coming back from a fun excursion around Barcelona.It's pretty much a small stand so take advantage of the outdoor seating with waiter service.Prices are good, they are friendly, and the nutella-filled or chocolate-dipped churros really hit the spot. \u00a0YUM!",
