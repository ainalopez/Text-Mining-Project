    "Maitea is a great place. There are a few tables in front and a few in the back. Most people sit at the bar. The cold pinchos are in glass display cases along the bar. Help yourself, keep your sticks, they will be counted when you are through eating to figure your tab. Everything is 1.65 euro each. You can order hot pinchos from a menu, but don't do it. By and by servers behind the bar will offer you stuff hot from the kitchen. Even after you have decided you have had enough, they come buy with fabulous stuff just out of the kitchen( which you can see in from the bar) and you will say ok, just 1 more.Desserts are good too.We were a little intimidated at first, but the staff and the other customers were great and after a short time we felt we had been eating pinchos all our lives.We went twice in our 5 days in Barcelona, I wish we had a place half this good in Florida, USA.",
