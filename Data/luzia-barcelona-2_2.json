    "We just wrapped up dinner here and I am obsessed. We tried probably half of the tapas on the menu, along with the red wine sangria and the secret mojito. Everything was outstanding, and I was equally impressed by the service. We are only in Spain for a week but I'm willing to bet we will be back to try the amazing looking pizzas.",
