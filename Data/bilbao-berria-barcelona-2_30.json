    "I *hated* Bilbao-Berria. I would give it one star, but I reserve that rating for places that give me food poisoning.After scouring Yelp, I was so excited to try this place. I mean, the concept is great, right?! You walk in, try whatever you want, and they charge you based on the number of toothpicks on your plate. Well, it's a great concept with *horrible* execution. Here's what I hated:*None of the food has labels, so you have no clue what anything is.*The guys working were all complete jackass douches, and they weren't helpful at all. We got there early at 7pm before the rush, but they still acted like they didn't have time for us.*The food was mediocre at best. Everything was cold and bland. And there were quite a few dishes that I absolutely despised!*The desserts were a big let-down too! The only one that was good was the blueberry cheesecakey thing.*The price! I don't mind paying for a great meal, but this was $60 USD crap on a toothpick. I am really clueless why this place gets such great reviews, but I just can't bring myself to give anything more than two stars.",
