    "The last (and best) meal I had in Barcelona was here at Arume. I'd actually gotten a reservation at Tickets but decided to cancel because Arume seemed A) more satisfying and B) less expensive and I had zero regrets! The blackberry mojito is deliciously sweet and beautiful--my bf liked it so much he drank most of mine :) Then we had the burrata appetizer with strawberries, guacamole, and hazelnuts which seemed like an odd combination at first but was wonderful. I loved the crunch of the hazelnuts and the sweetness of the strawberries. Also, the semi-marinated salmon dish which I also remember as being quite delicious. For entrees, the bf had lamb and I had the seafood paella. AMAZING. An abundance of seafood and flavor. I can't ask for anything more in a paella, really.We were pretty full but went for the \"La torrija de Manuel\" for dessert anyway. Not my favorite but pretty good nevertheless. Honestly, a pretty perfect meal. I'd go again in a heartbeat (if I were in Barcelona!)",
