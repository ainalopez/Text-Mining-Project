    "As other reviewers have said, this is a truly authentic Spanish restaurant experience. However, since it's Barcelona they must get a fair amount of tourists still, because they have a nifty English menu if you ask for it. I ate dinner here around 9:30pm, typical in Spain, and ate in their outdoor area. I was surrounded by Spanish speakers smoking, drinking, and eating (of course) and generally having a good time. I highly recommend the patatas bravas - they give you a huge heap of them with a mild cheese and delicious sauce on top, very good value. I also got the champiniones (mushrooms) and they were okay but not my favourite. If you want to feel like one of the locals and eat some delicious patatas bravas, come to Las Delicias!",
