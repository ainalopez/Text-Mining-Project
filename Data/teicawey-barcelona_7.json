    "After a few days filled with tapas and patatas bravas myself and himself, on holidays in BCN, fancied something a bit different. So, Tacos!The place was a surprise, being a shop filled with Mexican food imports as well as a burrito bar. I ordered the selection of four tacos for 8 euros, each distinctive, fresh and tasty. Zingy citrus, orange and lime and moist meat with a variety of salsas. Himself went for a burrito which he deemed also to be very tasty and unlike any we've had in Dublin or elsewhere.There's not really anywhere to sit, bar a few seats at the window, but if you found yourself there on a warm night you could get a take away and head up to the Placa de la Virreina and sit outside the church watching the life of Gracia go by. Definitely recommended, but if you want a sit down meal, best to head elsewhere.",
