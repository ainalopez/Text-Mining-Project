    "A dining experience unlike the others. Follow the instructions for a successful night:1. Line up. (There is most likely a line whenever you go. We went 4 minutes after it opened on a Friday night and there was already a line out the door)2. Step up to the wonderful display of live seafood over ice. Pick the seafood you want and tell the worker how much of what kind you want.3. Pick up your dishes, utensils, and drinks at the bar. 4. Pay for your meal at the bar.5. Find a table and wait.6. When your number is called (ex: \"Mesa seis\"), bring your ticket/receipt to the left kitchen window. They cross off the item you are picking up on your receipt.7. Bring your food back to your table and enjoy!8. When you have polished off all your food, bring your cups back to the bar and your dirty dishes to the right kitchen window.My family and I ordered:- navaja (razor clams): DELICIOSO!!! (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026)- Gargol de mar (sea snails): okay (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026)- Changuete (small fish): fried. just okay (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026)- Cigala (Dublin Bay prawns): yummy (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026)- gamba (prawns): super sweet and scrumptious! (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026)- ensalada (salad): veggies are always good (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026)- bottle of white wine - beerNotes to consider:- Arrive early! Less than an hour after it opens, it is at its capacity. They will not take you order because the cooks cannot fullfil all the orders, and you have no place to sit.- Wine is only sold by the bottle- CASH only!- La Paradeta is only opened a few hours a day. I believe 4 hours for dinner each day, then 3 extra hours for lunch on the weekends. Check the hours before you come!!",
