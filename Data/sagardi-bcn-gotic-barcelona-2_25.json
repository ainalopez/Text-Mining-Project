    "This was our favorite pintxos place in Barcelona. There's a lot of counter space at the bar and the selections are repeated at least 3 or 4 times, so as long as you get there early enough you can carve out space by your favorite tray of food. Keep your eye out for when they replace the trays because there's nothing more delightful than getting some tapas fresh off the stove. Everything we had here was good. There was something with smoked salmon that I really enjoyed, and my husband loved the sausages. Follow standard procedure here - grab what you want and they'll count the toothpicks and charge you at the end. My new favorite way of eating!",
