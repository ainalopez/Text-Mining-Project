    "We were recommended to this Restaurant by the Concierge at our hotel. I am so thankful for this recommendation because the evening and the food could only be classified as exquisitely spectacular. We came in without a reservation, and although they were fairly booked, they moved two tables to accommodate us so that \"we would not have to look at a wall.\" Talk about excellent service. The three waiters were all equally courteous and knew what they were doing. Despite a 16 person group seated next to us, the restaurant was comfortable and very stylish. Then came the food, the menu is in Catalan, as it should be, but it is impossible to go wrong. The appetizers were delicious and delicate, and the main courses were even more so.This meal probably ranks as one of the most delectable meals I have ever eaten around the globe. A very gracious host and restaurant, accompanied by exquisite cuisine, look no further for your stay in Barcelona. \u00a0 I can only hope my travels bring me back to this wonderful place.",
