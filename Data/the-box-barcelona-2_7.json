    "My adult sons and I saw that The Box was one of the top rated stops while in Barcelona and searched it out. We were glad we had the address because it is tucked away but we had an absolutely delightful evening with the friendly owners discussing our family's San Diego restaurants and the differences in Barcelona. The hotdogs were delicious and the drinks were fabulous with lots of unique choices to try. The ambiance is fun and it was a great spot to visit and chat with the owners. We will definitely go back!",
