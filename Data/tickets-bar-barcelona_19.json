Reserve your table 2 months to the day you want to go.Don't want to spoil the experience but when they say...\"Would you like to go to the dessert room?\" ...you get up as fast as you can and follow your waiter.Pros:* experience a different, new type of tapas.* fun, playful atmosphere * get the Vaca Viejo, any of the oysters, anything with pork.Cons:* didn't leave enough room to order every single dessert.",
