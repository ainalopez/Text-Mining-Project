    "Great spot for small plates that aren't the typical touristy fare. Had a decent bottle of Rioja for EUR 30 that was wonderful accompaniment. Lots of more economical and less economical suggestions on the wine list. Cornelia was part fancy market and part sit down gastro pub. Like a fancy restaurant had a child with your local pharmacy. The grab and go is probably great. It does mute the ambiance though. Try the squid and the burrata. Truffles for dessert were good but not good enough to cry for as the menu suggests.",
