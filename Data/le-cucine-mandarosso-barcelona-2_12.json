    "Cozy restaurant run by Italians. This certainly is not a touristy place, the cooking is authentic and they serve high quality food. The portions are quite big. We had a delicious Burrata coming directly from Italy, Lasagna, mushrooms Fettuccine and Pesto Fettuccine, duck ham (personally cured by Anna, one of the two chefs), Lemon brased Lamb and many other dishes.. Every one of them was superlative. Desserts were good too varying from traditional Neapolitan Pastiera, Cassata and Cannoli to several types of Cheesecake. Broad selection of Italian wines.Very affordable expecially considering the quality of the food.",
