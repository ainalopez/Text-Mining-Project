    "Sargadi, when compared to the alternatives in the area, is not the best place for pintxos. \u00a0It is certainly the most promoted by having large tour groups blow in and monopolize the few tables indoors. \u00a0Clearly this place has built its reputation on tour bus business - ugh, not a good sign.The night we got there a group of 30 German male tourists just barged in for a loud session of drinking and eating. \u00a0The term 'boor' or 'Schei\u00dfekopf' quickly came to mind. \u00a0What is with German dudes on travel? \u00a0Many places we went in Europe there were crowds of dudes travelling together - what's with that? \u00a0Kinda creepy.Anyway, back to the food...good choices for fish lovers and large pintxos, but nothing from the grill. Prices are 15 cents higher per item than other places, but the selection was too narrowly focused on fish. \u00a0 Hello!!!! Pinxtos are not sushi, folks, try to find some meat and grill it along with all the fish and seafood stuff. \u00a0Beer was slightly less than competitors, so the Huns must have been in heaven.Sitting outside always costs more in Europe. \u00a0We stood inside, like a normal pintxo customer. \u00a0The place is small and dark inside - not very welcoming.Go back down Carrer de l'Argentina toward the Jaume Metro station and get a better deal at El Rovell del Born",
