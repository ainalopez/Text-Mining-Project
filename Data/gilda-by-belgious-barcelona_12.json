    "My husband and I stumbled upon this place one night while looking for a few tasty tapas in Barcelona. As we quizzically peered in, a nice guy who I assume was the owner or manager came out and told us about this place. A blend of Spanish and Belgian food, he said. I was sold.We had to wait for just a bit but got a table near the front. The guy helping us explained they had a party of 20+ people come in so things were more hectic than usual. Right on. We sipped wine and checked out the menu. We decided to try the fried camembert cheese (because how could that combination be any less than amazing?) and the fried shrimp with spinach and curry ice cream (because the combination sounded ridiculous enough that it MIGHT JUST WORK). The latter combination did indeed work. It was like eating shrimp with curry sauce except there was that whole hot and cold combination. I was impressed. And the fried cheese was delicious and cheesy. If I had more time in Barcelona, I would have come back to try more things, but it was time to move on. Service was good and prices were fair. I'm glad to have stumbled upon this spot.",
