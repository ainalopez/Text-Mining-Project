    "Staff was great. Food was delicious. We got 2 meals for 3 people and were full. Try a pasta and a pizza for the full experience. I especially liked the carbonara. \u00a0I'd like to try some of those stuffed pastas next time. Also liked the house wine. Oh, and they have an English menu if you're an English speaker with less than perfect Spanish. Just ask.",
