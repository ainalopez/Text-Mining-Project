    "I'm not sure which was better, the fantastic unique food, or the passionate engaging staff. We went to Arume after reading the great Yelp reviews and were not disappointed! Showing up around 8:15 on a Monday evening without a reservation was a gamble, but thought noting of it. They did not have any tables available, but offered a full menu at the bar. We took a seat at the mostly empty bar. The host mentioned that if one of his reservations didn't show up, we could have their table. Luckily for us, a table became available and we entered the warmly lit dining area. Our waitress was so friendly and made us feel like we were her only table (but she engaged with everyone else the same). Quality of the food was outstanding and the cocktails were made with such creativity and care. We left at 10pm and the bar was packed!!! Perhaps show up early if you don't have reservations...",
