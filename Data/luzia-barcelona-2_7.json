    "First time at Luzia. Food was excellent. I had a tagliolini \"Cipriani\" with cherry tomatoes, dried tomatoes, pesto something else that can't recall at this moment. In one sentence, that's a tasty tagliolini you have. I also had a cup of green tea.Menus are also in English. When the waiter has taken your order, don't forget to ask for some bread, because she might forget to bring that for you. That's one minor point, but I'm willing to forgive her, because she was very friendly. You don't have to wait very long for your food to be brought to you.The place is very inviting and nicely decorated. There is a cozy atmosphere.The staff is very friendly and having fun while doing their job.The odds are high that Luzia and I will meet again during the rest of our stay here. In short, I would highly recommend this place to others.",
