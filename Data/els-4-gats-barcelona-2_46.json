    "We arrived close to 10pm. Seemed as the dining room was Separate from where we sat, as we only wanted tapas. \u00a0The room was beautiful, though I was actually hoping that it would look more authentic. \u00a0With a fresh coat of paint I felt it lacked its true history. \u00a0The tiles on the wall were very beautiful. \u00a0The waitstaff was very help full but when we ordered martinis (a drink he suggested) he came with a bottle of pre-made martini. Disappointed. \u00a0The food was really nice and would definitely go back for a full dinner.",
