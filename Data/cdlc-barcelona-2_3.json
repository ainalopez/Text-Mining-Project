    "Do they not check IDs in Barcelona ? Is that not a thing? I'm not sure but we just walked in around 1:30am. No wait. No hassle. No mandatory coat check. Music was house/ deep house. I loved it. Decor was sultry/ indie style. Which I digged. Comparable to TAO NYC. 3 DJ sets from 1:30am -3:30am. DJ booth is in the VIP section over looking the crowd. Similar to all New York clubs. Drinks were a bit pricey. 1 vodka red bull and tonic water was 18/19 euros. A LOT of older men tho. But I found that a consistent observation from all the clubs/ bars I went to. Older crowd in nightlife for sure. Dress code: ranging from girls in rosche Nike sneakers to girls in office clothes, to girls in stilettos and skin tight dresses. Guys: younger guys --slick back model wavey hair with basic tee and a leather jacket. And the older gentlemen in more formal wear. Has a smoking area outside that overlooks the ocean. In the summer this place would be awesome. It's known to be a Beach club. Mostly the clubs on this strip in barcelonetta are a beach clubs. So 100% recommend in the summer. No complaints would come back here for sure !",
