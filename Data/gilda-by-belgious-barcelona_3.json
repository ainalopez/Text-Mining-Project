    "Last day in Barcelona, Good Friday and we just got back from a day trip to Andorra. \u00a0This place was right by our hotel so we decided to stop in knowing it would be busy for a final meal in Spain. Fantastic choice. I had the beef filet cooked rare and it came out perfect. \u00a0The vegetables were cut like sticks and then tied together with a piece of seaweed. \u00a0My wife got the mussels which were the biggest I've ever seen. \u00a0Damn! \u00a0The service was excellent all around and I would recommend stopping by for a nice sangria (watched as they made some and it's a lot stronger than your typical sangria -- like a Long Island sangria) at the bar or a nice meal in the restaurant. \u00a0Since this was off the beaten path, the prices were MUCH more reasonable than eating on Les Rambles, and tastier!",
