    "This is also known as Bar Brutal. \u00a0Don't know why there are two of them as everyone seems to call it by the bar name, but same diff, my review stands the same as Bar Brutal.The worst. \u00a0Don't get the appeal as it's just full of tourists who are willing to pay these crazy expensive prices. \u00a0Staff are uber annoying, disorganized, and arrogant. \u00a0I guess this just keeps getting written up because they probably pay for advertising and everything else has already been covered to death in Barcelona. \u00a0But seriously avoid it if you want to hang to your euros and want to have an enjoyable time in Barcelona because you won't find it here. \u00a0Not going back like ever.",
