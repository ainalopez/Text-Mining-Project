    "This place is amazing. \u00a0We stalked it b/c we discovered the night before that Cal Pep and El Xampanyet are very popular. \u00a0We got there before it opened and waited and got a great table. \u00a0There were four of us and we had at least 12 tapas each one better than the last. \u00a0The service was great, the atmosphere was invigorating and the wine and food were delicious. \u00a0You can't beat this.",
