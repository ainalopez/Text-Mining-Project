    "The best chickpeas I've ever had in my life! This little eatery is in the Boqueria Market and has very limited seating. It is located right at the main entrance of the market. The staff are super friendly. We also ordered shrimp and beef cheek dishes. The flavoring of the shrimp was very good. All the dishes were solid but the chickpeas dish was exceptional! The prices were average but definitely worth a visit.",
