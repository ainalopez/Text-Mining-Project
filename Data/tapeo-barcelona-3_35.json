    "Small place, best to make reservations online via email, our waiter spoke perfect English and he was more than willing to explain the specials and make recommendations. We ordered the Rabbit ribs and it was surprisingly delicious and more meaty than what I expected ( my first time trying rabbit ribs). The had octopus on their daily special and it was incredibly fresh and soft (not chewy), the eggplant with honey was a surprisingly delicious combination. Another favorite was the leeks with olive tapenade.",
