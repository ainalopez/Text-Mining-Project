    "THIS IS A MUST DO IN BARCELONA FOR SEAFOOD FANS! We asked the guy to mix it up and he asked us how much per person? We figured since its seafood it may be a little more expensive so we said around $20. Next thing I know there is over 15 pounds of seafood on our table! We could not finish it but oh man was it worth it. Seafood is super fresh, some still moving and placed right into the kitchen. Don't forget about all the sauces they have! I would get one of each!",
