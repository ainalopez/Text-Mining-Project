    "Awww yelp, you really let us down. Went for blueberry pancakes but they came out swimming in syrup which should have been on the side and were over cooked and burned in the middle. My friend got the berry banana smoothie which was good but tart, probably unripe berries and didn't compensate with sugar. Her french toast came with big mound of yogurt on top, again best on side. It had no flavor but tasted like they just dipped in egg and cooked. No hint of vanilla, cinnamon, sweetness nothing but egg and bread. No syrup but it had so much yogurt on it, couldn't really put on it anyway. Waste of time and money, very disappointing",
