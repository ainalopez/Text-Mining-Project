    "The tapas here were terrific. We stayed away from the seafood and focused on the meat selection. We were not disappointed! The ribs were fall off the bone and the potato balls should be ordered two at a time as you won't want to share. The food came quick and the staff was very helpful. Sitting at the bar I believe helped. Oh... Don't pass on the sangria.",
