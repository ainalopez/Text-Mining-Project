    "Really great restaurant that we found through Yelp, otherwise I may have very well walked right by it since the exterior is low-key. The guys working here were really friendly too. We came for dinner and a small parade was rolling through El Poble sec on a holiday and they gave us a brief explanation in English about the significance. As for the food, totally great. I had the \"Ropa vieja de la abuela\" and it really hit the spot. Simple meal, but very delicious.",
