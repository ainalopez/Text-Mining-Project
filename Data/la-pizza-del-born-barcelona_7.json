    "This was by far the best priced lunch we had! \u00a0You could get either 2 slices of pizza & a soda for 3,90 euros, pasta & a soda, or a salad & soda for 3,90 euros! \u00a03,90 euros for that is a GREAT price for BCN!!! You walk up to pizza counter & tell them what two slices you want. \u00a0Then you move to left(bar & register area) & pay! \u00a0The mushroom pizza was good! \u00a0I had some of my friend's pasta salad (which was a nice size) & it was really good too! \u00a0Definitely a place to stop if looking for good food on a budget!! \u00a0Like most places in that area, the dining area is small but they have bar stools too.",
