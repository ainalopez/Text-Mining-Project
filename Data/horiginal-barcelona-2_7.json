    "We happened upon this restaurant while wandering around Barcelona's Raval neighborhood. Unable to translate the Spanish yelp reviews, we trusted the 4 stars and were very pleased. The paella was excellent, the best I've had maybe ever. The gigantic prawns were tender and juicy. The wait staff were bilingual and friendly. I loved this place and with so many choices in Barcelona it was great to have yelp to guide us.",
