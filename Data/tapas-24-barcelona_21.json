    "This was my first time at a 'real Spanish tapas joint' (as in I've never been to Spain before but have had tapas elsewhere) and I'm in love!A friend who I went with picked it and and I'm happy to follow here wherever now! Our party consisted of 5 and we ordered 2x Bomba, 2x Bravas, 2x bikini sandwich, 1x Spanish omelet, 1x lamb skewer, 1x tiny pasta dish and we were stuffed. Our waiter was brilliant and helped us with the menu and his desert suggestions were brilliant!The price in total (including more than a few glasses of wine) was about \u20ac27 each which was jaw droppingly great. We all left full and happy after.",
