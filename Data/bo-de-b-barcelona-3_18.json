    "This place definitely has cheap sandwiches and has a variety of combinations that you can make, but it is just not that great. If you are visiting Barcelona, I would say to just \"splurge\" on better food instead of this place. It is pretty bland and not memorable whatsoever. However, I do like the location, and there are plenty of places to sit around the cafe.",
