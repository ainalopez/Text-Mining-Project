    "We dined here on our last night in Barcelona. I wish we would've visited sooner! STELLAR.We ordered a bottle of the Clos Mogador - a fantastic price and amazing taste.We went nuts ordering, but got the pan con tomate (spanish staple, and quite tasty), mushroom croquettes (so creamy and full of flavor!), tuna with tomatoes (wish the tuna was raw, but still tasty), strawberries and foie (who knew they would pair SO WELL together? Trying this at home, drizzled with balsamic it was heavenly)... We also ordered one of the \"broken egg\" dishes. It was blah and simple with the Catalan sausage, but not horrible. THE DUCK CANNELLONI IS RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING! So amazing we ordered two. Full of flavor, almond slivers, hefty, just awesome. So if you go, I'd recommend that absolutely!I was very full after all this food, but they're small portions which makes it easier to order and try more.They hid us in the back near the bathroom, so it was quiet and comfortable. Loved the decor with the dangling lights, bottles of wine everywhere, and the menu plastered on everything!!!",
