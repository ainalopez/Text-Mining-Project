    "A great date spot!The Mister and I wandered a little off the beaten path to find Sensi, and it was well worth the walk.The restaurant is fairly small, dark, and romantic. We arrived early - around 7pm - so we had no trouble getting a table. But as the night went on, the place really got filled.All the servers were very friendly, low-key, and helpful. They were attentive with our food and our drinks. Here's what we had:* Potatoes with a spicy sauce - delicious, but beware of the cilantro!* Chorizo sausages* Sangria* Spinach and ricotta ravioli* Cheese plateEverything was really good except the ravioli. It was just kind of ho-hum.",
