    "Bilbao Berria is a must! I always come here for lunch when I visit Barcelona and I make sure I bring new friends to experience this wonderful place. After walking all around the city seeing the sites, stopping for an afternoon bite to eat and glass of chilled wine is must. You cannot miss this place and try your best to come here.",
