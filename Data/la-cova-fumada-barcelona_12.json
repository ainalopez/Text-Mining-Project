    "In two weeks of finding every well reviewed and secret awesome food spot in Barcelona this is the only place that I found and ate twice at. The food is fantastic and you can tell every member of the staff has so much passion for the food they serve you. Every dish is well prepared and the consistent quality of each dish is apparent. A must visit. Eat there as many times as you can afford during your time in Barcelona.",
