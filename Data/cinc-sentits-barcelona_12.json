    "Cinc Sentits is literally my favorite restaurant in the world. It has only recently in the past few years garnered a 1 star from Michelin Guide and it works hard to keep its rating. Cinc Sentits means Five Senses. For 3 hours, we settled into a very minimalistic setting -- good because it focuses on the food and service. Maitre d speaks perfect English, Spanish and Catalonian. Good job on the hiring! They have a shorter menu called the Business Lunch .. specifically for customers who want to experience Cinc Sentits but at a lower fare and less courses. ... I think what makes this place so wonderful is that it serves dishes with a local Catalonian flare. Everything from .. to the smoked sole, parsnip foam, suckling pig, cheese plate, truffles, \u00a0foie gras (hugeeeeee!!), to the amuse bouche, petit fours, desserts... everything was above and beyond any 2/3 star resturant here in the States. Reservations can be made online. BUT I highly recommend asking your hotel to make the reservation for you \u00a0--- hotels can help pull strings and perks. ;) Plus -- it assures you of your reservation. ** You can easily find Cinc Sentits by hoping off the closest metro station to the University and walk less than a mile.** total (w/ tip) was about $250 for 2 people. Worth it -- it was the only high end resturant we went to, and after going we have yet to find anything as good as this (and for the price).",
