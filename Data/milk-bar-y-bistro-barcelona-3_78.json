    "Delicious! \u00a0I was thrilled to see that home potatoes were on the menu with all of the savory brunch items. \u00a0Being from the USA, I miss home fries. \u00a0I didn't have such a big appetite today, so I opted for something lighter than what my eyes wanted me to order. \u00a0Next time I go I'm definitely trying the triple whammy burger, and maybe a side order of pancakes. \u00a0So much to choose from, and it all looks delicious!",
