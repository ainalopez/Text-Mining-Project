    "Sagardi is a popular tapas bar on the tourist route from the old town (Barri Gotic) to the lovely church of Santa Maria del Mar. A perfect excuse to stop and rest your feet, in other words. The bar itself is yet another of those with a busy counter at the front (where you stand) and a restaurant area to the rear, although there are lots of chairs and tables in the delightful little square outside if you prefer. The decor is simple: stripped stone and brick arches, with lots of wood. Their speciality is the small type of tapas on cocktail sticks (also called pintxos or montaditos), all priced at EUR1.60 (as at 2007). You order your drinks and are given a plate, and the bill is calculated by the number of sticks on the plate at the end. There are a decent number of vegetarian options here (in contrast to the restaurant, which concentrates on hearty Basque dishes and fish - I've not eaten there, so can't comment on the quality). Service is brisk and friendly. In keeping with the Basque theme, there is plenty of cider on offer, served from huge barrels - strongly recommended - but don't overdo it...",
