    "My favorite meal in Barcelona! We arrived to our hotel from Paris around 11am - tired, hungry, and salivating for our first authentic tapas experience. Luckily we were staying right by the La Boqueria so we decided to head over there. I had read about this place, and to my delight was literally stumbled upon it right as we walked in. \u00a0As all of the seats were taken, I have to admit, I was intimidated at first. There is no hostess eager to take our names down on a paper list like in the US, but one thing I've learned from my 10 days in Europe is that patience pays off. The bf and I hung around the bar for a minute or 2 and then alas!...the famous bartender/owner motioned us over to 2 empty chairs. As we sat down, we must have looked bewildered as he asked us \"carne or pescado?\". Luckily we knew enough about spanish and both yelled out \"carne!\". A few minute later delicious, salty, flank steak and a chickpea dish were in front of us, with some cava to wash it all down. \u00a0From there we ordered the dishes our neighbors were eating using the little spanish we knew. All in all, yummy food, great service, and an authentic experience. Can't beat that kind of first meal in Barcelona!",
