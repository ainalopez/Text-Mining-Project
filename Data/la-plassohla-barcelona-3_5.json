    "We popped in here for some tapas one afternoon. The atmosphere is really nice and there were a lot of intriguing dishes on the menu. We ordered patatas bravas and tuna and roasted pepper dumplings. Service was slow (even by Spanish standards). The food was definitely good but not memorable. Prices are on the high side. The lady next to us was on the phone the whole time and spoke to people in no less than three languages. That was impressive.",
