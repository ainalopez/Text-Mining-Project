    "Delicious and great service, what more could you ask for? Try the nachos- I've brought many people here and they have all said the nachos are the best they've ever had. It would be a huge and unfortunate mistake not to order them- trust me!! With that being said be careful the area can get semi-sketch (meaning that keep your belonging near and dear to you). Once while I was here some old suspicious man came in asking for a beer but left without one and the owner, Pepe, told us that sometimes people do that because they are trying to snatch away a purse or other valuables. Never happened to anyone I knew or myself but just be careful.",
