    "Run the other way. I gave it three stars because the place is beautiful, full of history; Picasso had his first showing in there and the restaurant is truly a legend. The staff is old and grumpy, not at all helpful. WAY overpriced. \u00a04 people 159.00\u20ac, for a very very disappointing meal. Starting with the bread, 2.50\u20ac per person, two appetizers; a tomato salad and some kind of esparagus salad ( Amanida amb Puntes) 10.90\u20ac each. 4 tasteless main courses; cod 21.82\u20ac, casserole of cuttlefish 16,36\u20ac each, a veal dish 32.82\u20ac. I don't quite understand the pennies, be that as it may it was awfull. Bottle water 3.64\u20ac each. The best and only good part was the wine 17.27\u20ac. A can of diet coke for our non drinker 2.73\u20ac. DO NOT WASTE YOUR GOOD EARN MONEY. Just peek in and look around if you really want to see the place, trust me, I'm telling you just run the other way. There are plenty of better restaurants in Barcelona...",
