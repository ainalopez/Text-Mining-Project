    "I almost dropped a star due to the presence of aggressive thieves nearby when we departed at 1030pm. \u00a0Scary - 2 encounters while walking up Via Laietana pedestrian walkway to the road at Placa Catalunya. \u00a0I didn't drop the star because I wanted to focus this review on the in-restaurant experience.Work buddy and I had dinner here. \u00a0Most of the diners appeared to be tourists. \u00a0Other nights might have a higher proportion of locals; the night we went there was a soccer match between Barcelona and Madrid that attracted the Catalonians--which made it easier for us to get a reservation.4 Gats accepts most credit cards - except American Express.FOOD: \u00a04.0. \u00a0- I had lamb shoulder. \u00a0Excellent.- He had roast chicken. \u00a0Excellent.- For appetizers we had warm octopus, salted cooked peppers, foie/mushroom croquets, and manchego cheese. \u00a0All good.SERVICE: \u00a03.5. \u00a0Very efficient. \u00a0A bit arrogant but prompt and courteous.AMBIENCE: \u00a03.5. \u00a0Only downside is the volume of chatter. \u00a0We sat at a table on the balcony and had a great time. \u00a0A small band (sax, bass,...) started playing about 9:30 or 10.",
