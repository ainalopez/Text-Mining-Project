    "Bar upstairs is very cool! \u00a0Sexy atmosphere, great cocktails and friendly service.The atmosphere and vibe in the restaurant was as cool as the upstairs Lounge. \u00a0However the Food and service at the restaurant did not live up to the hype and was severely overpriced for the portion size and quality of the servings and the service.",
