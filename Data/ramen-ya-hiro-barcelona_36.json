    "We are a ramen crazy family living in the San Francisco Bay Area We were on a cruise for my in laws 50th wedding anniversary . We did some research and from what we found it seemed like only one ramen shop in Barcelona .The food was great! Shop is perfect and owner and staff friendly and efficient . It was the highlight of our trip according to my son Enzo and while I did enjoy Italy, Greece and Turkey , I have to admit we do talk about the noodles when recounting our vacation. If you are in Barcelona this is a must go to shop.",
