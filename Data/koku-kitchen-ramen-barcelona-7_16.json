    "I know the urge to only try the local cuisine when you're travelling, but you need to throw that hesitancy away when you see Koku Kitchen's neon red 'RAMEN' sign. \u00a0Absolutely delicious ramen, drinks and desserts:+ Ramen: we tried 3 different types of ramen and each was great in its own way. \u00a0My favorite is still the classic Miso option+ Drinks: the homemade lemonade was super sweet just the way I like it, and the local Barcelona craft beers serve as a nice reminder of where you are having this awesome meal+ Desserts: we got the lunch special and the banoffee was the only option for dessert that day, but boy was it deliciousThe influence from the Irish owners' background shows itself in the Irish ciders and desserts offered. \u00a0The attentive staff and great playlist solidify Koku as 5 stars!",
