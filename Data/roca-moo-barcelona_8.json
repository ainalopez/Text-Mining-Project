    "We were seated promptly for our reservation. I think we dealt with 4 different employees during our meal, and they were all extremely friendly. We would make small talk and light jokes, and they would join in. It was pleasant. We did the tasting menu and I couldn't believe the flavors and how amazing everything was!It was neat to sit and watch the chefs do their magic. They have a great system.They were very efficient with timing of the meals. I lost count and couldn't believe it when they'd bring out another set of silverware. Never ending it seemed. And they would make sure your wine glass was never empty if you purchased a bottle. Everything about this place amazed me. Definitely expensive, but definitely worth the splurge.",
