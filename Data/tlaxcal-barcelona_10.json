    "Perfect for a Mexican craving in Barcelona! The tacos de bistec were phenomenal and the nachos were great. We wanted a side of guacamole with the nachos which wasn't on the menu, and our waiter was very accommodating. My friend ordered a margarita de guayaba which she really enjoyed. The signs around the restaurant are funny and entertaining too, with detailed instructions on how to eat a taco. Highly recommend!",
