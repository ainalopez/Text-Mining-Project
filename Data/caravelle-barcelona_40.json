    "I went to Caravelle with friends for an impromptu Saturday brunch and was totally charmed. \u00a0We ordered some drinks in order to kill a bit of time until the 1pm lunch menu became available (which overlaps with the breakfast menu) and loved peeking around at the people and the decor. \u00a0The staff is very friendly and the balance of people in the joint when we were there tipped more heavily towards locals; lots of young, fashionable people who knew each other from the neighborhood and a couple of families with tiny children. \u00a0Caravelle is bright, simple and beautiful and the food is absolutely delicious. \u00a0I had the baked eggs and they were scrumptious; the tomato sauce was sweet and delectable and the toast that came alongside was perfectly golden. \u00a0Caravelle is also known for their taco deals and their pastries, which are made fresh and according to what's available that day, are not to be missed. \u00a0I will definitely be coming back, especially when I have visitors!",
