    "I really liked this place despite the ramen being different to what I am used to. We got there 5 minutes after opening time and had to wait an hour for a table. Probably best to get there 10 minutes before opening to get in the first sitting.The gyoza were worth coming for on their own, but when paired with the deliciously hearty ramen broth, they were heaven. Definitely a place I can recommend for true ramen lovers.",
