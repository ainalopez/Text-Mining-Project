    "I once took a bunch of people here when a friend's birthday reservation fell through. Probably 15 people or so! This is just to illustrate how much I trust these guys for an amazing doner kebab. I studied in barcelona during 2006-2007 and ate there easily over 100 times. I was happy to hear that they have expanded since. This is how you run a successful fast-food business!
