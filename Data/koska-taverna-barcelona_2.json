    "Found this place via yelp, really close to our hotel and after a day of exploring Barcelona my feet weren't up to a wander to more touristy areas of the city for dinner. The place is quaint and wasn't busy - but then we arrived at about 7.30pm, it was certainly busier when we left around 9. We had the chorizo, salami, omelette with potato, onions and chorizo and the potatoes (can't remember the name of the dish in Spanish, it's boiled new potatoes cooked up in salted water and served with a spicy sauce). The potatoes were delicious - a definite recommendation. I've had better chorizo but this one was fine for a casual dinner. My husband enjoyed the omelette too. Decent prices, we had our tapas and some wine and beer - total cost 27 euros.There were plenty of pintxos to choose from but we weren't feeling adventurous. There was smoked salmon, jamon iberico, tuna stuffed into a pepper and many more. All in all, I'd have given it 3.5 stars but I don't have that option. Fine for a casual meal with good food, attentive service and a nice atmosphere.",
