    "The Quick: Seafood lovers only. The boiled octopus served with paprika, sea salt, and olive oil is a must try. The Details: The boiled octopus is so fresh and simple, we had it every day in Barcelona. The sangria is good, the croquettes are also worth a try, but the star of the show was obviously the octopus. The \"small\" portion (pictured) was a good tapas size for two. The Damage: About 10 Euro.. SO worth it.",
