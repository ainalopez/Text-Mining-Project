    "Els Pescateurs. \u00a05/5. \u00a0Truly fine dining in a part of Barcelona dominated by touristic, unserious food hawkers. \u00a0Deeply serious about the Catalan food tradition, Els delivers intensely fresh seafood interpreted by local techniques, with a deep regional wine list in an elegant, sophisticated setting. \u00a0The restaurant is in a beautiful small courtyard with three (fig?) trees with white tablecloth set tables outside and two food preparation tables directly in front of the tables. \u00a0The courtyard was quiet and serene when I dined there at 10:30pm on a Monday night in August. \u00a0It was lit by streetlamps of the square. \u00a0The wine list was extensive and almost exclusively consisting of wines of the region. \u00a0I had a Xarel Lo (grape) from Penedenes (region) that blew my mind. \u00a0Tomato soup, if one could call it that was incredible. \u00a0It was a puree of tomato, cucumber and Catalan aioli with Jamon silvers and a crunchy piece of toast. It really showed off the quality of the ingredients. \u00a0Clams in white wine were delicious though somewhat conventional, and a seafood (anemone/jellyfish??) was like an oyster crossed with an urchin, served fried and mind broadening. \u00a0The main dish I had was a fisherman's rice, which was essentially a risotto made with fish stew. \u00a0 This place was like a school devoted to the investigation of how to use local fish, produce, wine and make innovative but traditional dishes. \u00a0 Its not cheap so be ready to pay for the privilege of the education into Catalan food.",
