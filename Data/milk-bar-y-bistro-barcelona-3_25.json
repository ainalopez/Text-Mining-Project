    "Great place for breakfast! Had vegetarian omelette - typical European smaller portion, unusual for an American but actually large enough and, of course, very yummy. Good coffee, which is normal here in Europe, even chain coffee shops brew very decent java. Very friendly staff and nice ambience. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Catalonia's capital. Unless I stay closer to Sitges, in which case I'd drive to Sports Bar there for breakfast buffet;-)",
