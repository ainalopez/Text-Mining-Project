    "This place is fant\u00e1stico. Rapid service, excellent tapas, great bar seen, and tasty desserts (postres). My hotel recommended this tapas bar and I am extremely glad I came here. I'm staying in Barcelona for a couple more nights so may have to come back at least one more time. The bar tenders are very friendly and they speak English which helps with my broken espa\u00f1ol. LOL. Be sure to order their grilled langostinos and their shrimp with garlic. Very tasty! Pair it with some vino tinto and you should be set.",
