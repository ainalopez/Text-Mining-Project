    "Like most have said before, \u00a0Barcelona does not have a shortage of \"tapas\" places to choose from and most being tourist traps at best, \u00a0but this little hidden gem off the beaten path was a welcome surprise. Somewhat inconspicuous in its locale, as are often some of the best places to eat at, \u00a0the experience here did not disappoint. The flavors within the dishes were superb. \u00a0We had patatas bravas (cooked to a slight crisp with an amazing sauce drizzled over them), \u00a0fried calamari (typical but still very good) and the salteado, \u00a0which was heavenly. You will not be disappointed at all. And the prices were fair to boot!",
