    "After searching all over Barcelona for something to eat, we decided on going to this Buffet where we can try a bit of everything. You really can't go wrong here. Everything we had wad good and you definitely can't beat the value. All You Can Eat steaks and sausages cooked right in front of you. My only regret is that we didn't find this little gem earlier on our trip. I highly recommend it for anyone traveling to Barcelona.",
