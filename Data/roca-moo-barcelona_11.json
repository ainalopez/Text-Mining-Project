    "Ate at Moo on the recommendation of our go to person at our hotel, they were right on. Our evening was enjoyable, comfortable and everything we tried was wonderful. I did the gourmet tasting menu and my companion did the seasonal. Starters were brought out consisting of different deconstructed nibbles and some little mojito flavored bubbles which popped in your mouth. Beautiful Golden Egg, brittle shell with lovely filling , Pigeon Carpaccio paired with an amazing Jerez. Palamino Fino, Bread tray offered through out the meal with fresh hot rolls and herb coated crispy breads, course after course followed with standouts being an offering of red mullet perfectly cooked crispy skin stuffed with cherry tomatoes, prawns coated in a batter with shavings of crispy pig trotters, it melted in your mouth. The wine pairings \u00a0were excellent and perfectly accompanied the food. The service was friendly, not stuffy and the tables were far enough apart that you could feel very private, all in all a wonderful experience.This is in the Hotel Omm fairly central location. Would go back",
