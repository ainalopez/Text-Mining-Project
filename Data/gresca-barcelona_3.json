    "With so many good restaurants in Barcelona, it was not an easy task to pick just a few restaurants to go in our Weekend in Barcelona.When I asked my \"foodie\" friend to give me one recommendation for a unique dish to try out when in town, she said Gresca Tasting Menu or their Egg Souffle.Making the reservation was a little challenge as the only way to contact Gresca is by calling them the old fashion way. There is also no information on their website \u00a0gresca.net aside from their name and phone number. Lunch Special for 19 Euro is an excellent value. We were presented with a menu in Catalan but our nice waiter was able to translate that to English for us. But it really didn't matter as we just going to order everything from the menu as there is 2 choices each for the 3 course meal. And of course the Egg Souffle on the side. Everything was delicious and of course the Egg Souffle is really interesting both in taste and texture. I even enjoyed my Mackerel and even the vegetarian appetizer of stuffed onion with nuts was interesting too. We spent 2 hours enjoying our food and shared a bottle of wine. I wish I can have such an leisure and enjoyable lunch more often.The restaurant has a really unpretentious vibe. Simple but just made me go wow. Gresca is one of the best example of the Bistronomia Movement of offering high-quality cuisine at an affordable price: a combination of bistro and gastronomia. That does sounded good to me!",
