    "The decor was cute. The seats are white leather, the walls and tables are white. There are black pictures of the owner (lady) holding a camera everywhere on the walls. The bulbs and lighting is the \"FLASH\" of the camera. Very cute theme. Bathrooms were bright red and very modern and nice.The food however was TERRIBLE! As husband and I were seated the server brought our olives for us and it was extremely salty. We ordered two \"tortilla\" (spanish omelets) One with iberian Ham & Cheese and the other was Mac and cheese.It was brought out to us very WATERY and dripping wet. So wet that our omelets were soggy and we were literally slurping. It was so gross we couldnt finish, paid our bill and left.",
