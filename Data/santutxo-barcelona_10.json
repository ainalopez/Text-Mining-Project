    "Being silly American tourists, we came here for lunch at 12:30 pm. It was like walking into a ghost town. We were soon greeted by the chef/ possible owner, who was the only one there. He was very welcoming and kindly let us know that we should come back a little later for the best experience.We came back at 1:30. The meal consisted of an appetizer, main course, desert and free drinks (water, soda and beer!). It was a set menu with a few options for each. I ordered a rice dish and the cod. The appetizer was a little disappointing and was rice, a fried egg and some plain tomato sauce on the side. However, the fried cod and the amazing chef definitely made up for it.Will definitely make a point to make it back here if I'm ever in the area. It'll seem like a hole in the wall from the outside, but you should give it a chance, especially if you're staying close to the Sant Jordi Sagrada Famil\u00eda hostel.",
