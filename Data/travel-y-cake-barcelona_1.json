    "Small and cozy local to have breakfast, brunch, lunch or an energy boosting snack. The cakes and cupcakes they make are quite good for a snack matching a vanilla or matcha latte (which I personally recommend if you are a matchaddicted like me). For lunch, the mango avocado chicken salad is one of the best options you can choose, it is tasty and healthy. One negative thing is that they have a poor variety of cakes because they only have two staples, the carrot cake and a red berry velvet cake. Also, I'm a little upset with this place because they never have beetroot latte (and I came specially for this like 3 times) so I have not been able to try it yet. About the staff, they were normally nice and caring but today I felt a little cheated by one of the waiters. The thing is I cannot drink regular milk because I suffer from a slight lactose intolerance so I ordered my matcha latte with soy milk (which has an extra of 50 cents), as I usually do. When the waiter brought my beverage I asked him again (just to make sure) if it was made with soy milk and he said \"yes, of course\". Okay so, I believed him and drank my matcha latte and minutes after my stomach started to feel sick, that was when I knew he lied to me. I wasn't sure 100% that my pain was because of the milk until I saw the bill, where the 50 cents extra for the soy milk were not included. This may sound stupid for some people, but those who can't drink regular milk like me know how annoying is to pay for something that is going to make you feel not good.",
