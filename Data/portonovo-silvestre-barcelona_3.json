    "The food was good, but the waiter we had was excellent. He was patient with us while we tried to ask questions in broken Spanish and he tried to answer in a mostly non-English. I'd left the restaurant without my bag of souvenirs -- he came racing down the street after us with the bag -- we really appreciated that! On to the food:The seemingly ubiquitous tomato-topped bread was pretty average, so we were a little worried from the start. However, we ordered the massive tray of miscellaneous grilled meats and veggies (two of us -- for the record, it probably could have fed 3 or 4). The goat, rabbit, and chicken were all cooked perfectly, and the veggies were tasty, too.",
