    "A new place is always fun! Pleasantly surprised by the low-key burger+chips bar for the vegan lovers out there and for the non-vegans, their tastebuds will be tantalized! The place is laid-back (feels like a SF bicycle bar) with a creative spin on bravas and vegan burgers. The local artisan beers (por fin, we have more than Estrella+Moritz!) are worth the trip, plus a great way to attract the veg weary. The burgers are good, not the most incredible in the world, but good. They were out of a few so we all tried the same one (black bean), grand portion presented with more potatoes and a nice selection of sauces. Curious about the other burgers, will be back soon with my carnivore partner who loved this place!! Great for dinner with a small group of friends or for a chill lunch.The more veggie friendly spots, the better!!",
