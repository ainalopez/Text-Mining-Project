    "Absolutely delicioso!!! The food was very authentic and I'm happy to say that it doesn't cater to the Spanish palate. Which is probably why there were so many Koreans eating here. \u00a0 The people are nice, but they seemed a little overwhelmed. I guess that's to be expected of a new, family-owned restaurant. I hope they stay in business for a long time. I'm definitely going to do my part to help them.",
