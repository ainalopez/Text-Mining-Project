    "Being Americans, we arrived early (just before 8:00 for dinner) which wound up being fortunate as the restaurant was already 3/4 full and was completely full 15 minutes after we sat down. Food was good and reasonably priced, the vermouth was nice and the staff was very friendly. My wife & I, and more importantly our kids, liked everything we ordered. Atmosphere is great if a little cramped. By the time we were leaving it was a mob scene with a wait outside.",
