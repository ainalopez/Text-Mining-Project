    "If you can't speak English, do not go here! I went on a Wednesday night and it was packed! You order at the bar but there are lines at each end of the bar and people all over yelling out their orders. When I finally got to the front, the bar tender just kept overlooking me. Guess I needed to scream but I don't speak Spanish. It's a shame, I really really wanted to try this place. It was so confusing and everyone was so rude. I walked out. It's definitely a place for locals. I'm sure the food is great.",
