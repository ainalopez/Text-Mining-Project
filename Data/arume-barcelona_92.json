    "My girlfriend and I use Yelp religiously on our travels. We were in the mood for Paella in Barcelona and Arume looked amazing. They did not disappoint at all!! We had the duck and seafood Paella. (Two separate dishes) The duck had more of risotto feel to it but havIng both styles really brought multiple levels of complexity. Rooney behind the bar was an awesome guy. He made great drinks, referred to us as sir and ma'am and was extremely personable. I would go back just to chill with him. However, the team there definitely deserves some love too. You guys got some fans for life. We'll see you the next time we come back.",
