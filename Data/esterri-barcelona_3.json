    "The food here was really great, and the staff was incredibly helpful. \u00a0We speak very little Spanish, and they didn't speak any English, but because the dishes were showcased in a glass case behind the counter, we were able to point to what looked good. \u00a0The meatballs and empanadas were really tasty, and we ate outside at one of the restaurant's cafe tables, which made for a great experience. \u00a0We tried this place because it was one of the few restaurants within walking distance of our hotel that had been reviewed in English, and we are so glad we did!",
