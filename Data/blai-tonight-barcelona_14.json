    "This was a great place for dinner. The ambiance was just what we were looking for, low key with excellent music playing in the background. The wide selection of tapas was laid out in front of the bar (vegetarian and dessert options included). They had a toothpick counting system whereby each person had a cup where they deposited the toothpicks that held their tapas together, and which marked the total of the bill (each toothpick = 1 euro). The choices were filling and my friend (she's a pescatarian) and I ate until we were stuffed for under 20 euros total. The draught beers were super cheap at only 1, 80 euro each. The staff was super friendly and knowledgable about the contents of each of the tapas options. You must try the dessert of phyllo dough with goat cheese stuffed inside and a raspberry marmalade on top, it was excellent!",
