    "Both Maitea Taberna and Pinotxo seem more highly regarded in Barcelona's Basque-style \"toothpick tapas\" scene. Unfortunately, Pinotxo (in the Boqueria Market) was closed for most of the summer and Maitea just seemed too far to walk from my hotel. Txapela is a corporate concept restaurant located on the upscale shopping street of Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia. The warm wood interior and lively atmosphere draws you in and makes you forget about the nice, large terrace out by the street. Just a five minute wait even at 9:00 peak time in August.All 50(!) of their \"pintxos\" are priced right around E$2 each. This is a good and a bad thing. It's easy for less expensive products like veggie skewers to meet this target price, but it forces them to compromise on more expensive items such as seafood. For example, my \"crab salad\" was actually imitation \"krab.\" Tasted good, but still...What it perhaps lacks in \"fine dining,\" it more than makes up for in \"fun dining.\" Best sangria price in town around E$10.25 per liter. Avoid the too-sweet cava sangria and just go with the red (\"tinto\"). This place was fairly close to our hotel, and I'm bummed that we didn't get to it until our last night in BCN.",
