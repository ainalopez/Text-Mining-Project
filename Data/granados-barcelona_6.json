    "Great place for a nice lunch with friends. We all loved the food and the presentation. The service was great, too. We had a very comfortable and large round table which was perfect for a small group of family or friends. Loved the beef with caramelized onions.Only negative: white cheese dessert. It was very overpriced for a scoop of Philadelphia cream cheese with a drop of syrup on top. Tiramisu was better, but small.",
