    "A great place to sample a huge variety of cuisines that you can find in Barcelona. And what's better, it's a food court where you can buy beer affordably, though it's all the same type of plain draft beer. But it goes great with pimientos padron, which almost all the stalls sell. They are deep fried without coating and salted, they are the edamame of Spain.My only complaint is that if you're not careful, you can easily spend 20 euros for 2 people here even if all the individual items are quite affordable.Try the huevos estrelladas near the '3 o clock' side of the food court. So good!",
