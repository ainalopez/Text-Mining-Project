    "By far the best Mexican food Ive had in Barcelona. The chef is an extremely friendly Mexican man who is obviously very passionate about serving authentic Mexican cuisine. All the food is very reasonably priced, and very very delicious. We indulged in flautas, nachos, and an assortment of tacos. Needless to say, I was incredibly satisfied with my experience at pachucos and I will definitely be back! A must go if you're craving an authentic taste of Mexico!",
