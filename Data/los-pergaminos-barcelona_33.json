    "Located in a gorgeous part of the Gothic Quarter, this restaurant boasts beautiful d\u00e9cor, a lovely story (be sure to ask about the history of the \"scrolls\") and is family run. \u00a0The food it outrageously good - we had the seafood paella, stuffed figs and grilled pork. \u00a0Everything was delicious. \u00a0A true find.",
