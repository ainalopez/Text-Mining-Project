    "Stumbled into this restaurant while looking for another and I'm glad we did! Great little place with indoor and outdoor tables, great food, and nice staff. Food was delicious and huge portions for the price. We got 3 tapas, 3 entres, and 2 bottle of house wine all for 50 euros! Cooked well and tasty. Going back before leaving Barcelona :)",
