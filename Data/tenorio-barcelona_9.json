    "My friend and I have been traveling through Barcelona now, just finishing our fourth full day. \u00a0Normally, I'd be yelping after every meal, but the restaurants here have been so mediocre that until this evening, I've had no urge to write a review. \u00a0This restaurant changed this.Coming from New York, we have been disappointed by the overall lack of variety in food here. \u00a0But Tenorio was a perfect meal, in every way. \u00a0We stumbled on it because we got out of bed late, and it was around midnight...things were all closed. \u00a0This place was open, and we were starving. \u00a0We were greeted by their staff. \u00a0It took a while for someone to come to our table, but he really took care of us. \u00a0No pressure sell, no hassle. \u00a0No gotchas. \u00a0We had 3 entrees and two were amazing (entrecote steak, macarroni bolognese), and one was just very good. \u00a0(chicken terriaki). \u00a0The cappuccino was among the best we've had, and the tiramisu was light and just right.And also very much worth mentioning -- this was by far the best deal we've had so far in Barcelona. \u00a0The food here is expensive, but this place under-charges and over-delivers. \u00a0Going back tomorrow.",
