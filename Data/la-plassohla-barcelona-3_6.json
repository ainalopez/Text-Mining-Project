    "Oh la la la....What a gorgeous space. Loved the 3 course lunch and went twice during my stay in Barcelona...appetizer, main , dessert for 14 euros....a very very good deal considering the quality of the meal, includes the best bread in all of Barcelona and the beverage of your choice...The house wines by the glass are very fine. I probably had the best sweet item of my entire stay in this wonderful city....lemon cream...thin almond cake bottom ..crispy cookie top (see pic).Very upbeat ,happy service.As an aside, the people of Barcelona are delightful...",
