    "Quiet place off the beaten path in Barcelona. \u00a0Amazing suckling pig done in their huge wood burning oven. \u00a0Friendly service but know very little English. \u00a0They also have tapas and the few we tried were decent. \u00a0My favourite dish after the suckling pig was the beans and bacon.",
