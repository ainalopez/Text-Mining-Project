    "Having been rather pleased on previous visits to their sister cafe Brunch&Cake I thought that this would also be good and since we were staying close by it felt like a good option. First of all service was however very lacking - after trying to get the attention of the staff for a while I ventured up to the counter to order but was almost rudely told to go and sit and wait for someone.After a while someone came over and I tried to order. My first option was sold out and the next one I was informed that the ingredients were totally different from what was on the menu (it had information of turkey and gruyere but it was now only ham instead). Since my two first option were not available I asked if she could tell me what was actually on the menu and then just got a blank stare and then a statement everything was available...Settled for the eggs Benedict hot dog and others went for a chicken salad and the mango bagel with chicken. I also made the mistake of going for coffee - the coffee was definitely better skipped...Food eventually came and when I got the eggs Benedict with the hot dog it was clear that the ingredients were very cheap and low quality. The hot dog was clearly the cheap store bought one and it was wrapped in the type of thin turkey slices that goes on the sandwich. Taste was fairly flat and nothing really stood out. Disappointing. The bagel was ok-ish, best thing was the fresh and nice mango but everything else was pretty bland and the chicken was sort of rubbery in texture.Not sure if it is the same owners as it really feels as if the sense of quality has just disappeared and the service was disinterested at best (and rude at worst) so will not return. Prices are also at the higher end for Barcelona.",
