    "If I lived in Barcelona, \u00a0I'd live in the El Born area. \u00a0And Bormuth would be my local bar. Located on a sloping corner, \u00a0Bormuth occupies 2 floors, \u00a0and has an outside terrace. We went here a few times - it was always really busy, \u00a0mainly with locals rather than tourists. The staff were extremely friendly and were able to recommend some great local beers to try out. We didn't eat here - but when we visit again, \u00a0we definitely will - the food looked and smelled amazing! It puts me in mind of a Spanish version of Brutti Ma Buoni, \u00a0back home in Glasgow.",
