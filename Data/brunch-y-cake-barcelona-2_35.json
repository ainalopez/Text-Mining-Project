    "The food was outstanding - delicious combination of sweet and savoury in my eggs benedict with salmon on a waffle. The truffle eggs were also divine!The decor and layout was cute and location also very picturesque. The only downside was te smoothies simply seemed to be juice (from a bottle) blended with ice. Didn't taste fresh at all.Apart from this - think I'll be coming here again very soon! (Tomorrow's breakfast!)",
