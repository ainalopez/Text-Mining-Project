    "Who doesn't have an appreciation for Picasso? This place is full of history!Having the privilege of dining here was like a dream. I went with my mother when she came to visit me while I was living in Barcelona. We didn't make reservations, and although it was quite busy, they were able to accommodate us fairly quickly. We got to sit on the upper level at a table for two with a great people-watching view over the piano and lower floor. The atmosphere was lively and the food was delicate. To eat: We had their tomato bread, olives, and prosciutto to start, followed by their fish and ravioli (highly recommended) for dinner. Heads up- the restaurant does leave the fish almost fully intact (if you're not a fan of bones)!Not only is the food great, but the people were friendly and its location in the gothic quarter is perfect for spending time roaming the streets after you eat.",
