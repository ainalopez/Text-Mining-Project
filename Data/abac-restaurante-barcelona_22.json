    "This restaurant has ruined me forever.Jordi Cruz, the head chef, is a culinary genius and artist. \u00a0The meal I had here was the best of my entire life, I can't really point at anything that was off - from the impeccable and warm service and attention of the staff, to the masterful sommelier who carefully paired wines to match each dish, to the serene and modern setting, and of course to the beautiful and rigorous menu of Chef Cruz.. \u00a0It is worth a flight to Barcelona just to eat here. He also has a wonderful book out, \"Logical Cuisine,\" which will leave you in awe.",
