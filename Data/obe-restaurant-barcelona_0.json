    "Daughter and I had a super lunch last week, outdoors. \u00a0Warm service, waitresses couldn't have been nicer, \u00a0Really super food, I had the one of their daily lunch specials - it was just crazy, 3 courses for maybe 12-14\u20ac (I can't recall), excellent food. \u00a0 This is high-style food served in a more casual atmosphere and with great quality. \u00a0 We are definitely fans - highly recommend for a great lunch, and it's around the corner from the Mercado de Santa Caterina if you have any room left.",
