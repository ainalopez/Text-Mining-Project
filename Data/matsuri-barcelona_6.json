    "Really fresh sashimi, great ambiance. The standout dish was the Bare roll (chopped salmon with lime juice on a bed of rice) and also the California Especial. But I could see all the rolls being made and they all looked delicious. I went on my own and sat at the sushi bar, pretty attentive service until they got really busy and the place filled up. Lots of people without reservations waiting or turned away by 9:30 pm so come early. I would definitely come again.",
