    "WE love you Gonzalo!!! \u00a0I wish we have a restaurant like yours here in LA we would go every day!!! What an amazing place! The presentation & quality of their dishes were something that we still remembering! We had a foie gras with artichokes that it melt in you mouth..mmmmmmmmm I wish I was there one more time. My boyfriend had Pig Legs that were exquisite ! we seriously keep talking about this place. It was so good we were here twice in 3 days!! The servers were very friendly, and the chef came to greed us! He was so nice that we tough he was a server too, until he said he was the chef! lol He definitely went the extra mile for us; he suggested a couple of great restaurants that we could visit during our stay in Barcelona. However, IGUELDO was soo good, we had to come back =) TIP: Try their Cheese Ice cream!!!!",
