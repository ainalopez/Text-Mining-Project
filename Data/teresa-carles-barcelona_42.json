    "The food was excellent. The flavor of the salad and quesadilla were both wonderful I also had the green medicine juice. It was packed with veggies and tasted delicious. It only gets 3 stars because the service was horribly poor. Slow to take your order, slow for the food to arrive and clearly not enough to staff. Only visit if you \u00a0don't have time constraints.",
