    "This was our favorite dining experience of our 10 day vacation in Barcelona, and we visited several Michelin starred restaurants!You could tell Pau was passionate about his menu and about your time there. \u00a0His English was amazing (our Spanish was subpar) and he took the time to explain each item and its intricacies to us.As someone with a shellfish allergy, it was no problem at all to find something delicious. \u00a0The foie was one of my favorite dishes ever (-:We loved it!",
