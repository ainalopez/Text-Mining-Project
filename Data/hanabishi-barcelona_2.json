    "First class sushi, very fresh. Ingredients are also fresh. What is really nice is the Udon soups they make here. If you order a Tempura Udon, make sure you ask to have your tempura on the side! The lunch menu is also very nice, and the Miso Soup they serve is exceptional. The cook is Japanese, something you don't see much nowadays. Overall, I give them a 4,7/5,0. I have been coming to this restaurant for almost 10 years and the quality has never changed! Amazing food with a very spacious dining hall. Come try it ;)",
