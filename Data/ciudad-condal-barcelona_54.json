    "BY FAR THE BEST RESTAURANT WE ATE AT IN BARCELONA. I am glad I followed my cousin's review and ate here for our first dinner in Barcelona. Oh boy, did totally set the bar high for dining in Spain. First, the service was excellent. We had an amazing waitress, who was Filipina. Which made it fun to speak in my native tongue in a foreign country to me. Our waitress was nothing but helpful; she gave awesome recommendations. The food was spectacular. Seriously, everything we ordered was super flavorful and cooked perfectly. The cuttlefish and squid were delicious! They were cooked so perfectly. The squid was not chewy and the cuttlefish melted in my mouth. \u00a0The braves and the aioli served with it was the best thing ever; we didn't want to stop eating it. We also ordered some cheeses and a few more tapas based on our waitresses' suggestions and all of them were beyond delicious. The desserts were divine as well.Seriously, if you end up in this corner of town, choose this restaurant. You won't regret it and you will regret going to the other places. It was a great experience.",
