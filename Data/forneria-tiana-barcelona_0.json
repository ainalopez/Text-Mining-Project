    "My boyfriend and I shared a sandwich and a pastry. The sandwich was a hearty brown bread roll with tomato sauce and brie. They cut the sandwich and warmed it on a panini press for us. Delicious!The pastry was insanely good. Flaky, filled with chocolate, topped with whipped cream.Service was very friendly and efficient. Had fun eating at the small table and seeing locals come in to buy bread and chat.",
