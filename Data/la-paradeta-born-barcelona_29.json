    "Not exactly tourist friendly. You have to step in and pick the seafood from the front and they will cook it how you ask them to. We weren't sure about serving sizes (you have to order whole octopus, whole cuttlefish, etc.) and didn't get much help from the staff. But the food tasted great when they came out. We ordered the seafood soup, either cuttlefish or squid and giant prawns. The prawns were pricey (about 10 Euros for 5 prawns). Delicious though. Very fresh. Also, very clean bathrooms.",
