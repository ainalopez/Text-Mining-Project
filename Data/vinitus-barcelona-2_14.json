    "3.75 stars... \u00a0Like to give it more but didn't get to try too many dishes. Cool little joint. \u00a0Good food, good size restaurant with sidewalk seating. Good service..Clams and Calamari dishes I had were pretty good (see photos). \u00a0Like I said, I let them pick and it was pretty good.",
