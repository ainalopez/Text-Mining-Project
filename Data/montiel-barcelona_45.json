    "Using Yelp in Barcelona was a little challenging since really only tourists are reviewing but this one turned out to be a truly good find. \u00a0We stumbled around Barcelona trying to find someplace to eat since our first choice had a line out the door and around the building. \u00a0Yelp led us here and we are happy it did. \u00a0We happened on the last table of the night. \u00a0We didnt realize it was a set menu and it was much more than we had planned on spending for the night but it was a great experience, especially after having so many tapas. \u00a0We were ready for an actual meal. \u00a0Everything was outstanding. \u00a0The wine that our server recommended was perfect, the leek soup was amazing, suckling pig was rich but so good, only thing that we didnt think was the best was a steak special that was not cooked enough. \u00a0It was pretty rare inside but the flavor was good and it definitely was like butter. \u00a0This is an expensive dinner though just so you yelpers know, especially after eating and drinking at tapas bars for a total bill of $50 you need to be ok tripling that price here. \u00a0If not then this isnt for you.",
