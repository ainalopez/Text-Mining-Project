    "One of the best meals and experiences we had during our short three days in Barcelona.After a long day of walking and exploring Barcelona, we hopped into Ciudad Condal and found ourselves at the bar with an overwhelming variety of food on display before us. We were first given a menu to look over, but after a quick observation of the diners around us, we just started pointing and ordering whatever looks good.We started off with a pitcher of Sangria, which was strong and delicious. With the heavy rain pouring outside, it was the perfect drink choice for the evening. We then had the grilled razor clams, pollo croquette, fried baby squids, camembert, salted cod, smoked salmon on baguette, grilled anchovies and shrimp octopus skewers. Favorites are the razor clams and shrimp skewers! Seasoned lightly and grilled to perfection. Our bellies were stuffed and happy at the end of the night. What's best is that everything came out to be only 50 euro!Definitely a fun and tasty tapas experience and a must-go in Barcelona.",
