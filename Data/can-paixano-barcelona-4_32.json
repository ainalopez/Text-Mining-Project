    "Some of my favorite things in life are cava, cured meats, sausages, marinated fish, and pickled things.Can Paixano is one of those special places where you can spend less than 10 euros a person and get a meal composing of all the things that make me happy.Not only that but I can be in and out and left feeling completely satisfied in less than 30 minutes. This place is super efficient and that makes me happy too.True there are lots of other tapa shops in BCN but this is one of my favorite because it was tasty, fast, easy, and cheap. Great quality from what I could tell too.",
