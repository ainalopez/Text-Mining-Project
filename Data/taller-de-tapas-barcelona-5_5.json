    "food is okay. they gave is cheddar cheese with our supposedly meat and manchego plate. sangria is too soda tasting and not much alcohol in it. service was slow but the staff were nice. it is probably just how they are. not a place i would recommemd to try. but if your hungry and its close to you then go ahead its not all bad either. food is mediocre so it is pricey for its quality.",
