    "I can't rate this any higher because I had such wonderful food at Cantina Mexicana near the Sagrada Familia that there simply is no comparison. If you want real Mexican food go to Cantina Mexicana. This meal started with nachos that came with what looked and tasted like melted Velveta cheese and a slither of beans at the bottom of the plate. Not a good start. The enchilada dish we ordered had an interesting red sauce but not authentic and concerning because how can you mess up enchiladas. In fairness the arachera steak was good or very good and that alone could be a four except for the entire experience. They also gave no tortillas and that is a must for any arachera even if not hand made at least prefab tortillas. The folks at Cantina Mexicana are from Mexico and here not so maybe that made a difference. I would pass on this experience.",
