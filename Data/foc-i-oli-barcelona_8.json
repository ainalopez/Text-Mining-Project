    "This little place is amazing and has lots of character. Met the owner/chef who is so friendly and patient. Menus are in Catalan so he sat and translated all to English for us.Most of what we saw were burgers and sandwiches. I tried the beef burger and my husband had the foie gras one. Both served with a side of patates - simply delicious! He took care to make an onion 'confit' with wine reduction, meat was cooked exactly as we ordered it (medium).Really enjoyed our meal - even more so with a small Estrella on the side. Though burgers aren't the first thing that comes to mind when you think Spanish food, this isn't a bad idea at all. The patates and Estrella helped give it a local flavour, and the burger themselves have been tweaked (sauces/bread used). Definitely recommend this to someone who is over eating tapas! Prices are great and the owner is super nice! Would be back if I returned to Barcelona :) thank you for a wonderful meal.",
