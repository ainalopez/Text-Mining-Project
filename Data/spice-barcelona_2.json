    "Best desserts! We were already stuffed after dinner but had to try the 3 desserts, carrot cake, coffee cake and orange mandarin pudding. All of them met my high expectations. Desserts were eel made with lots of flavor but yet not super sweet or buttery. Perfect cream with the carrot cake! We plan to go back again!",
