    "In our recent visit to Barcelona we were told we had to eat at this spot. When we finally got there the line was out the door, due to its bar style seating of only maybe 20 seats and its popularity. I wasn't too excited about waiting 45mins in line but it was definitely worth the wait. When we got seated the gentlemen asked us how many tapas we wanted and if we'd like what he recommended, which was fine with us and definitely a perfect choice. The food was amazing, the best clams and squid I had on our trip. Chef Pep was also extremely friendly, shaking hands and taking pictures with people. This was overall a great experience!",
