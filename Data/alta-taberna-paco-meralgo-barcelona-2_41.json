    "One of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona !! \u00a0The atmosphere is welcoming and the environment is super clean. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. The tuna steak was so delicious that I ordered it twice - yum!! \u00a0Patatas bravas and pimientos al padron were perfectly cooked. The solomillo ( Sirloin steak) was excellent. Pan con tomate was the best I've ever had - delicious ...... \u00a0We got there around 130pm and had no trouble finding space. I would recommend to find a seat at the bar - this way you can see all the delicious tapas pass you by and you can make a better decision on what to have. :-)Go around lunch time or around 8p-830p before the place gets crowded.",
