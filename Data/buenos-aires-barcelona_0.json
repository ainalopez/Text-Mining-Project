    "What a wonderful wonderful restaurant! This should be the number 1 restaurant in Barcelona! Reasonable prices and excellent steaks! We started out with the empanadas and another started that contained delicious chicken. I was so surprised when Daniel stopped over to check on us. We never had anyone check on us at a restaurant in Barcelona! We sat outside and it was very delightful as well as well as the service! They even took American Express which was appreciated.",
