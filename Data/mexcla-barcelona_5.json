    "My fianc\u00e9 and I are staying in Gracia for a month and are thrilled that we found this fantastic restaurant so early in our stay. \u00a0As a Texan, I was surprised to find that the Mexican food is exceptionally good and the Margarita is very well made. \u00a0The tacos al pastor and the carnitas were perfectly cooked and well presented. \u00a0We will enjoy the food and the cocktails here several times before we return home.",
