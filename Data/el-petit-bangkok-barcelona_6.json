    "El Petit Bangkok was one of the best (if not THE best) meals we ate during our week in Barcelona. I know, I know...Thai in Spain? But hey, makes as much sense as Thai in America, so whatever.You HAVE to make a reservation ahead of time, as the restaurant is extremely small (maybe 10 tables in the whole place, most of them 2-person tables, I'd guess). They have a 9pm seating and a 10:30pm seating.Also, give yourself plenty of time to get there as it's not super close to a Metro stop. Walkable from the Metro for sure, just not close.Affordable, delicious, hole-in-the-wall...perfect!",
