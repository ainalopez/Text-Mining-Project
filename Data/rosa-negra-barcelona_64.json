    "This was recommended to me as authentic Mexican food. \u00a0I live in California, and while perhaps the food we have in that state isn't always fully authentic, it comes close. \u00a0What I ate here tasted more like Tex-Mex to me, and none of the dishes had much flavor or interest. \u00a0I do recall that the cocktails were good, though, and the service was exceptionally friendly. \u00a0Good atmosphere.",
