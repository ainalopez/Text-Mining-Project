    "It's been a year since the last review, so perhaps things have changed for the better. I ordered an empanada (speck, scarmorza, champignon) and the Sta Fabiola (mozzarella, berenjena, calabacin, tomate gratinada al pan, champignons and cebolla caramelizada. Shove that into your translator program!Their menu features classic, vegetarian and vegan, and house piadina selections. I found my piadina stuffed with delicious vegetarian ingredients. I had my choice of 5 breads, so I chose tomato and oregano. The empanada wasn't a packed as I would have liked, but the dough was excellent. There were also piadina \"chips\" on the smaller high tables. Overall, I enjoyed this pleasant surprise and consider another successful lost field trip in Barcelona.",
