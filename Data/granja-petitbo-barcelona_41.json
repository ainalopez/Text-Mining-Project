    "I've passed by here dozens of times and finally decided to go on a Tuesday afternoon. There were only two other tables so they obviously weren't overwhelmed with customers. The girl behind the counter completely ignored me for a couple minutes before I finally asked if I could order something. I was going to order a juice but opted for an iced mocha which have been harder to find in Barcelona. When she brought it out I was expecting it to taste as good as it looked but it was probably the worst mocha I've ever had. It was basically water with a little coffee, huge chunks of ice, and chocolate syrup frozen to the sides of the glass. I read my book for about 15 minutes but there was no wifi and it was extremely hot with the sun beating in so I left promptly. The weekend brunch here must be exceptionally good for this place to get such good ratings but I would not recommend it for a snack/drink on a weekday afternoon.",
