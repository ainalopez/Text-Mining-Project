    "Everything we had was very tasty. The portions were definitely on the smaller side which was nice so that you can try more dishes but it was priced on the higher side compared to other restaurants in the area. Still worth a try, don't forget to make reservations; just make sure you're not starving when you go. Favourites were liquid olive, sea urchin, razor clams, bread with tomato and Iberian ham, smoked mackerel variety dish and beef and tomato stew.",
