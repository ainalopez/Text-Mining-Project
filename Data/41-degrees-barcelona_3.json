    "Creme de la creme. Best of the best. Unique. A gastronomical journey. My palate went around the world at 41 degrees. I could talk for hours about this meal however I will put the main points here.On our honeymoon my wife and I splurged for 41 degrees and took a journey through 41 amazing, incredibly detailed tapas that journeyed the world. Each tapas was a unique creation that almost was to beautiful and delicate to eat. This dining experience is also \" an audio and visual experience\". As you go through the various tapas the sounds and sights around you change to compliment the meal. The taste was even more amazing then the presentation. The kitchen and waiters are in sync as your eat your meal. The wine pairings are a must and they complement the meal exquisitely. We left full, satisfied, and in awe. My wife and I could not stop talking about the most delicious and beautiful meal we have ever had.",
