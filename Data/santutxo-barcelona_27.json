    "We were looking for a late night dining spot near our apartment on carrer de'independence and found Santutxo on Yelp. Wow, what a great place. Cozy atmosphere, with lots of pop culture memorabilia from the USA, which made us feel very much at home, but not nearly as much as did our host, whom we presume to be the owner. All of the tapas we sampled were awesome, particularly the Pinchos Marunos, the cheesy potatoes, which were suprisingly spicy, and we topped this off with an amazing chocolate lava cake like concoction and delicous espresso and coffee with cream. Highly recommend this spot for anytime dining....",
