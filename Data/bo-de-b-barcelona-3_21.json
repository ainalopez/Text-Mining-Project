    "Delicious!!!!!Anticipation made it better. Seeing all the food laid out and watching them prepare it was an experience in itself, at least for me. I'm a little ashamed to say I ate my chicken bocadillo in one sitting, partly because it would have been too messy to wrap up and save for later. But mostly because it's just that good. The bread, the meat, the avocados (costs extra), the veggies. Will definitely go back before I leave.",
