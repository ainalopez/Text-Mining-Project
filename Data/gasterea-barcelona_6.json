    "One of the best meals I had in Spain, and all I had were pinchos, which in this case were like canapes: bread topped with 2-3 ingredients. \u00a0They were so good and fresh that they almost seemed like a tasting menu.I don't love shrimp, and still had two orders of an incredible one paired with arctichokes and some delicious sauce. \u00a0I think we had two of sobresade which had some manchego cheese also, and was outstanding. \u00a0I loved the butifara negra, which had a quail egg on it, and was as good as most morcilla I have ever had. \u00a0Can't remember all of them now, but there was nothing we didn't like.Melanie had a couple of great glasses of red wine...for 2.20 euros, which seemed like a ridiculously good value. \u00a0The whole thing was a great deal actually.",
