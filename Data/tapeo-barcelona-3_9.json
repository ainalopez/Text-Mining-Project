    "Is this place worth the wait and sitting at the bar? YES! This was one of our favorite places to eat when we visited Spain. While there was a short 15-20 min wait, the time passed quickly as we ordered a cava sangria and got to drink on top of a barrel outside on the street. We mostly stuck with the usuals (croquettes, patatas bravas and the honey short ribs) but all of them were delicious. The ribs are definitely as good as everyone says and you definitely need to order them. After we left Barcelona we went in search of finding equally good ribs and every place fell short. We were dreaming of the ribs after we left. We tried both the cava and the wine sangria and definitely felt that the cava sangria was much better.The restaurant also takes credit card which is good because this place is definitely on the pricier side, especially compared with typical spanish pricing. But it's so worth it!",
