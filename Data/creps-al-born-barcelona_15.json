    "Very yummy crepes, quality ingredients and expertly prepared, plus with gluten free options a-plenty. \u00a0Super yummy cocktails, too. \u00a0I had one made of red pepper and vanilla vodka, plus who knows what else. \u00a0Sounded weird... but was very refreshing and delicate. \u00a0Decor is delightful, service is speedy, and prices reasonable (for Barcelona). \u00a0Only downside was that it was a little bit warm and stuffy inside. \u00a0Other than that, I would return for sure!",
