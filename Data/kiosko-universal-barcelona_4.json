    "Love this place...2nd time back and still loving it! The killer dish for us was the beef stew (not on the menu). We saw someone ordered it and we just pointed to the server to order that for us. It was to die for! We also ordered the grilled scallops and that was good as well. We went at off peak hours so we didn't have to wait.",
