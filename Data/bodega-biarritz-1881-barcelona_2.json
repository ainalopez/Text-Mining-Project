    "Stumbled upon the place during a walk through the gothic quarter. \u00a0We weren't even that hungry but once we saw the food, we decided to eat.Service was excellent - the woman serving the food was patient with all our questions about the food. \u00a0It was very quiet when we first arrived so she was devoted in her time with us.Basically, they have lots of individual food items on plates and you choose what you'd like and they'll heat it up for you. \u00a0Items are categorized (vegetarian, beef, etc.) but they'll happily tell you what's in each one. \u00a0I can't decide if little signs to alleviate all the questions would be helpful or tacky?Food quality was delicious and we left feeling very satisfied. \u00a0Prices weren't cheap but they weren't expensive either. \u00a0Overall, this was a great find on the street.",
