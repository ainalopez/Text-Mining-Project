    "Part of the extended Las Ramblas street, MasQMenos makes its home here. \u00a0If you want to get away from the super crazy street but still be a part of the action, come here. \u00a0I stumbled across this place because another popular restaurant was completely packed, and the wait would be over an hour - no thank you! My family and I decided to do the outdoor seating because when in Barcelona, it's all about the outdoor patio seating. \u00a0All the tables were full, so we had to wait about 15 minutes for something to open up. \u00a0The host was so kind, but I felt so bad for him because he was the only one working the patio area and had to walk back and forth from the restaurant to the patio area constantly - I was sure he was going to pass out!We ordered a bunch of different things but I opted for a tapas seafood platter (picture attached), but we also ordered a salad, Iberian Ham, and sandwich. \u00a0I'm starting to get a sense of Spanish food and will say it is quite salty especially the ham and fish. \u00a0I did enjoy the food, sangria, and atmosphere and would recommend it for anyone who's looking for something kind of touristy but still local.",
