    "We stumbled upon this looking for a cute place to grab some cava and chill. \u00a0We ended up have several glasses of cava and had to order the patatas bravas with all that cava. \u00a0The patatas bravas was among the best that we had in Barcelona. \u00a0We very much enjoyed the bodegueta to sit inside among a delightful crowd, enjoy the tapas, the cava and the lively staff. \u00a0I highly recommend stopping in for just a drink or tapas too. \u00a0Great experience! \u00a0Cava on...",
