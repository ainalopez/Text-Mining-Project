    "Chose this place mainly because of the view. Looks like it was straight out of a movie. Looking down you see all the shops, all the people, it's just great.I got the yakisoba and the portion was small, but the flavors were delicious. A bit on the salty side thou. The waiters were friendly. My friend ordered a dish that had a chili pepper in it and she ate it unknowingly and when we asked for milk, they just gave it to us for free. They probably felt bad when they saw how red she got ;)",
