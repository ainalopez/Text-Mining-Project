    "OMG What a night we had at CDLC. First thing that gets you when entering this place at 11pm on a saturdayevening is the huge amount of beautiful women. (and off course all the buddha's and VIP beds, secretly hidden with white curtains). We got the best table of the house, the round one in the middle of the veranda with beachview. Even before taking orders the massage ladies come and start to treat your neck and shoulders ..... To keep things easy (we were party of 8) we ordered all the Chef's Menu (a surprising five-dish menu that blends the best of the Orient and Occident). \u00a0WOW WOW WOW the best choice you can make, tuna, hamashi, wagyu, ..... only the best for the best ! \u00a0They have very good wines and nice big cocktails. At 01AM they take out some tables and the centre part becomes the club where we danced and drank till closing which is at 4AM. But no worries, the neighboring club Opium stays open till 6 .... ;o)",
