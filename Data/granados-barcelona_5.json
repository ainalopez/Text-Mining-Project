    "Granados is a really nice little tapas-place that changes their wine menue so often that they write it on the wall instead of printing it out.There is free Wifi and we are here to drink a few cappuccinos, cavas and eat a little. The food is ok, but I wouldn't go here only for that. However, the place is cozy and modern, so it's very nice to sit here a little while.Don't forget to visit the bathroom with its moustache-art when you're here.",
