    "I enjoyed this place. \u00a0Some tapas were better than others for sure, but overall the food was of a high quality. \u00a0The bread it was served on was perfectly toasted and tasty, which added to the toppings greatly. \u00a0It was certainly better to wait for plates of tapas to come out and take the new ones, rather then picking the old ones that have been sitting out for a while. \u00a0This restaurant did seem to cater mostly to tourists, but I was a tourist, so that worked out fine :) \u00a0We got filled up for cheap.The pick-what-you want thing is great for people who may be reluctant to order something new at a restaurant; they can just sample one little tapas here and stop if they don't like it. \u00a0 Also good for those struggling to speak the local language, as you just serve yourself - in any case the waitresses all seemed to speak English.",
