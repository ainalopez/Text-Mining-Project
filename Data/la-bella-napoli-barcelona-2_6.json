    "After walking about Barcelona for four days and seeing so many (so many!) pizza joints around, we took a break from the tapas to try some wood-fired pizza. Good service and open late (I think we sat at 930, left around 11), with reasonable prices and good service. Ingredients were fresh and of good quality, the crust crusty and chewy just like you'd expect from brick oven.We didn't really have room for it, but ordered dessert and we're quite pleased with the cannoli",
