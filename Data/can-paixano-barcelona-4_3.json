    "About as authentic as it gets, muscle up to the counter and order whatever off the menu you can pronounce.This place recommended to us by a friend who studied abroad in Barcelona. It was certainly the most stressful restaurant in Barcelona, as coming around lunchtime you'll be greeted with a wall of people packed into the extremely space. You will have delicious Cava spilled on you, but if you make your way to the counter and get attention of the one of the cooks, you'll be treated to some of the best sandwiches and wine in Barcelona. Just make sure you brush up on your Spanish - no one is going to help you and the menu is all in Spanish. Just order whatever you can pronounce, some Cava, and enjoy.",
