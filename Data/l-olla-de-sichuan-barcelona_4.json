    "This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant in Barcelona. You definitely have to try the \"Sichuan hot pot\". Basically it is a hot bowl with two different types of broth (go for the Taiwanese flavor, is awesome) served with lots of fresh vegs, meat and fish to cook directly in the broth. Yummy!",
