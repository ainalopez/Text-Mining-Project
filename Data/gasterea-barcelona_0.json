    "I spent three days in Barcelona and combed yelp for reviews on good tapas spots and EVERY SINGLE one was a tourist trap. Vaso de Oro is too old school. Senyor Parrellada has shitty food. Basically anyplace anywhere close to the main drag is going to serve you a concept of tapas that is too antiquated and contrived to meet the standards of gastronomy today. Instead, head to the outskirts and pick up something that fits the soul of the contemporary patrons around you. The Gracia area is exactly that and is going to be a great place to find some food that retains character. No anemic looking patatas bravas here. The service is amazing. The owner is a true gentleman who wants you to have a good experience at his restaurant, which is beyond affordable and a bargain for the quality of the product you get. We had multiple dishes, but the stars are the cazuelitas, which are braised dishes. I had the matambre which was a beef tenderloin stewed in onions and garlic as well as a friedcodfish that was baked in a tomato pepper sauce. Super comforting! His montaditos are also great, some notables were those that included cheese, as well as the codfish and crab salad.I highly recommend this place. Highly. Highly.",
