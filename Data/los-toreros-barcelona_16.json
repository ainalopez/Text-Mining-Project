    "One of the best places for tapas and paella! Must try in your visit to Barcelona. This place has a very Spanish feel, with traditional decorations and cozy lighting. Our party of 3 ordered/shared the pulpos, pimientos rellenos con queso crema, morcilla con cebolla and la paella mixta for 2 people (min 2 people to order a paella), all delicious and plenty of food for all. We tried the sangria, a bit stronger than what we were used to but still very good, and the house wine, which is sold by the glass and half bottle. Prices are very reasonable. I totally recommend this place, in fact, I plan to go back before leaving Barcelona.",
