    "Let me start by saying i live in Southern California and eat excellent Mexican food at least once a week. My wife said she wanted Mexican and I was a little hesitant we are in Spain, not Mexico, but Tlaxcal was AMAZING. Tlaxcal is as good or better than my go to Southern California spots. The staff is awesome and has a very laid back easy going style. And awesome beards. My wife and I started with a tortilla soup and ceviche. The soup was excellent and the ceviche was some of the best I have eaten. For main course I has green enchiladas which were the best I have eaten in years. My wife had the steak tacos which she devoured. Large servings of steak in each tacos and fresh vegetables everywhere. We shared a strawberry margarita which was extremely strong and tasted excellent. They give you your bang for your buck here with the tequila!! The atmosphere was very nice and the restaurant was very clean. This is some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. Super traditional and tasty. They even had Jarritos!!! If you love Mexican, you have to try TLAXCAL.",
