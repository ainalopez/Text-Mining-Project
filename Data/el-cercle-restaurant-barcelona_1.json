    "Great restaurant set in pleasant venue. The review is for their European menu not the Japanese. Food and wine were all good, everything was enjoyed. Service was slightly slower but that seems to be the norm in the area. They let us enjoy the meal for a long period of time. The outside terrace looked nice although they didnt have space for our group.",
