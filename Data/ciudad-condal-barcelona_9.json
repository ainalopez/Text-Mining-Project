    "Great place. Love the ambiance of it being outside. Service was quick and the food was great. I only rated it a 4 because I didn't get a chance to try more food as we had eaten somewhere else and came here for dessert.Flan de Coco- Amazing ! Great flavor, sweetness and overall soft and delicious. Croquettes were also tasty, moist and good size, Cappuccino was great..flavorful..",
