    "Since my slow but sure migration toward Montj\u00fcic's hillside (Poble Sec), I've been yearning for the good, quality pizza you can find more centrally in Barcelona (read my review, for instance, of NAP). \u00a0As a true pizza addict, then, I was absolutely *thrilled* to drop in last night at Pizza del Sortidor, an impressive pizzeria in the heart of Poble Sec.On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, *all* of their pizzas (some ranging in price up to 12 or 13 euros a pie) are available for 7\u20ac...Amazing! \u00a0I ordered the Caprese and a glass of wine. \u00a0The pizza was massive, with a deliciously authentic, chewy, and charred crust and a particularly exciting savory tomato sauce. \u00a0The pizza was overflowing with arugula, mozzarella, and fresh tomatoes. \u00a0WOW! \u00a0Absolutely delicious. \u00a0What's better? \u00a0The red house wine goes perfectly with the pizzas--I am in love.There are a couple of oddities about this place (the lack of silverware and plates, for instance...you'll see when you get there) that make it a bit quirky, but their pizzas are spectacular. \u00a0I will be back to Pizza del Sortidor, and I can't wait!",
