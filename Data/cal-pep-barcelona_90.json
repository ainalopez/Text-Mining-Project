    "We arrived toghether with another couple and after about an hour of waiting were we seated and we were treated with a 10 course meal of amazing quality. The Tuna tartar was together with the Monkfish the highlight of the evening. The rest of the small tapas dishes close behind. The food were made fresh as you sat by the counter. I have to dwell with the Tuna Tartar - it had such a wonderful divine taste and it was such a joy to eat it. We had a fantastic time at Cal Pep and even that we had to wait for an hour or more was it so worth it. Do not get freighten by the long queue - it is so worth waiting to be seated.FoodServiceAtmosphereValueLiked: Disliked:",
