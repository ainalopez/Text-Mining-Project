    "It was great to find some Venezuelan food in Barcelona. We ate here twice and both times the food was great. They cook daily dishes with no fixed menu, but always seem to provide a variety of items. Try the cachapa w/ cheese accompanied by the pork. All the food was good overall and I recommend giving it a try. The atmosphere is very simple and local which is what we like. The negatives were only two... the waitress was not overly friendly and when we went back a third time she did not seem to want to serve us for some reason so we left. Also, we ordered bottled water and it was so expensive it blew my mind. Other than that, the food was very delicious.",
