    "I'm so excited to have found this restaurant! \u00a0Tasty, authentic Thai food. \u00a0Both my partner and I really enjoyed our dishes, and I was pleased to find that the spicy dish I ordered was properly spicy (almost too spicy for me, and I have a higher spice tolerance than most Spaniards, so be careful with the spice levels)!Service was prompt and friendly, and the decor was nice as well. \u00a0They had English translation on the menu and the staff speaks English as well as Spanish.It's not a very large restaurant so I'd recommend making a reservation on weekend evenings to make sure you get a table promptly, however they have a few tables to seat groups of 6 and even 8 people, so I wouldn't call it tiny either.",
