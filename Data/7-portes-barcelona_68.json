    "Hello.I just dined at 7 Portes tonight for dinner. I recommend you avoid this place at all cost. If you are having second thoughts about this place, good. You should dine elsewhere. This place is definitely a tourists location (i am one of them) and locals definitely do not come here. They definitely skimp on a lot of stuff such as the Paella Manolete dish (two shrimps - actually it was one shrimp cut in half, one mini sausage, two mussels, tons of chickens here and there - thats it) and still charge 22 euros? Couldnt taste any truffels on the Festival Truffed Canneloni dish either. Way too salty and overpriced. I am sure there are better Mediterranean / Seafood / Paella places than 7 Portes. But I've heard La Fonda del port Olimpic has great Paella at a reasonable price. If you decide to come to this place, great. I highly suggest you make a reservation in advanced. Just dont come with high expectations and be prepared to open your wallet.PS. The service / waitstaff arent as friendly as other restaurants in Barcelona. They could smile a little more. =)",
