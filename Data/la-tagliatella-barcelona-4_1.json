    "Catalan food is very good. \u00a0But if you're used to eating a variety of cuisines, you will eventually crave something different. \u00a0Something without surprise slices of ham or anchovy, perhaps. \u00a0On a night like that, American Tourist, you will really appreciate La Tagliatella. \u00a0La Tagliatella is a chain restaurant, and the decor takes a page from the American Franchise Handbook (i.e., lots of framed art, pasta in frames, faux aged paint, etc.), but in a way that's not too silly. \u00a0There are locations all over Barcelona, but this one is right around the corner from the Mutaner Metro station. \u00a0And you won't feel too badly about being such an Ugly American when you realize that everyone else in the restaurant is Spanish. \u00a0They like this place, too.The service is warm and efficient. \u00a0The food is fresh and DELICIOUS. \u00a0And the portions are huge. \u00a0Splitting your pasta would not be a bad idea. \u00a0But if you don't, they'll actually give you a doggie bag. This may be the only place in Europe that will. \u00a0I felt like a conspicuous American jackhole carrying my logo plastic \u00a0bag out of the restaurant, but the rest of that gorgonzola parpadelle and I had a date with destiny. \u00a0Tomorrow. \u00a0At lunchtime.",
