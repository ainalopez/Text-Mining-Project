    "Great food, prices and friendly service. The team here was extremely patient and kind. Just FYI it is a tiny little place. There is no menu, the dishes range between 1.50-4 euros a piece. \u00a0They seat you and you must go along the bar and let the 'waitress' plate the items you would like to be warmed up. Once an item is off the bar, it is gone! There isn't a running kitchen that will cook more of your favorite item, so grab it while you can. This was some of the better food I had in Barcelona! The service also made us feel welcomed to the city.",
