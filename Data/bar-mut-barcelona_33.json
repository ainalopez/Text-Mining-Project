    "We have been traveling in many European cities over the past 2 weeks--never have we experience such an awful culinary and service experience. \u00a0Everything we ordered was below average quality, extremely high priced (eg a plate of just mushrooms grilled was 26 euros). \u00a0The waiters were inattentive, service slower than slow and power/lights in restaurant went out twice during our meal. \u00a0All travelers need to stay clear of this place",
