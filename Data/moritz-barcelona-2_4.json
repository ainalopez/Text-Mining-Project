    "Dropped by Fabrica Moritz for a night cap after a late night dinner...The place was really empty but music still so loud. Service was slow and lukewarm compare to other bars we been to in Barcelona.Moritz and Moritz Epidor were the only beer available for the evening. I prefer Epidor, a strong pale lager over their pilsner maybe for the stronger ABV content?Not worth a special trip but not bad if you are in the neighbour to drop by for a quick drink.Did not try the food but seriously with so many good restaurants in Barcelona eating at Fabrica Moritz was not at the top of our list during our short visit.",
