    "The only reason I came to this restaurant was for the historical aspect- I'm a sucker for a historical restaurant and this place didn't disappoint. Without a reservation I went in on a Sunday afternoon at 230. Was told the wait would be an hour for just me, so I put my name down and went for a stroll. Arrived back after an hour and they sat me promptly. The service was impeccable. Honestly- haven't had service this good in ages. The care and attention to detail and making sure you were well taken care of was without fault. The had the salad which was my favorite! And the Richman's seafood paella. I'm not a fan of paella but tried it as this is the place to get it. Not bad- but I have had better Paella. Not overpriced- but lots of asian tourists. Lots. So you do feel like you're in a tourist trap. If you want good food in a classic location with ridiculously good service- go here. Most other places you'd stumble upon would be worse food in a worse setting.",
