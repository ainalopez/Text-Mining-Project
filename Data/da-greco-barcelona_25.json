    "Was talking about the pasta for days. And I loved that they brought out tasting plates of my dining companion and I's dishes, so we could try each others without sacrificing any of our own. AND they overheard me saying I was torn between what I got and another dish -- and they brought me a tasting plate of the other dish for gratis. Great service and food",
