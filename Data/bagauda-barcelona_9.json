    "On my last night in Barcelona, my boyfriend and I decided to try Bagauda, recently opened by the same owners that founded Barcelona Reykjavik.We ordered 3 croquettes -- cheese, ham, and onion/orange (because they ran out of mushroom). The onion/orange was surprisingly delicious, and I would suggest requesting it as an off-menu item. The tempura Icelandic bacalao was really, really delicious. The cod is salted for preservation, but re-hydrated prior to preparation (I believe). The end product tastes fresh, tender, and not too salty. High recommended.We also got a small order of ham - it was the most delicious ham I had in Barcelona, and I ate ham every meal the 2 days I was there. It was a lot less salty (a +) than the other ham I had -- in fact, it was almost sweet.To finish off the meal, we ordered Gretel cake, which was made of ground almonds and poppy seeds. I'm a huge fan of sweet things and I can honestly say that this is in the top 5 slices of cakes I've ever eaten. It's almost better than the 16-layer crepe cake from Lady M in New York City. I highly, highly recommend getting this cake.I ordered a Brioche as a last desert item, and as all the bread items are from Barcelona Reyjavik, it was amazing as expected! I expected to eat half and save the rest for later, but I downed the whole thing without thinking twice.The service at Bagauda was great! They even offered us two free tapas.If you need more information on the food at Bagauda, read this article (the original reason for why we frequented the restaurant):culinarybackstreets.com/\u2026",
