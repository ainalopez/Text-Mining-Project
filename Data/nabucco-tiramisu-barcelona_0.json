    "Myself and 4 other ladies were staying nearby on our Barcelona vacation. We loved this place! The coffee was great as were the desserts! There was a petite, lovely young lady with short hair who really stood out (even though everyone who helped us was awesome)... she was very friendly and thankfully she spoke decent English. Wish I could come back!",
