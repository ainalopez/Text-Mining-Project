    "I don't even know where to begin! My friend and I wandered around and ended up on Plaza del Sol and found this place. \u00a0Honestly you can never go wrong with tapas anywhere in Barcelona... Until you get to this place. \u00a0They had tables outside and we saw that it was packed so we decided, had to be good. \u00a0We ordered croquetas de jamon, sausage de casa, patatas bravas, lasagna de bechamel. \u00a0The waitress goes on to say they only have croquetas de bacalao. \u00a0Now for those of you who have been to Spain, you know this is very odd. \u00a0It's equivalent to walking into a McDonalds and them saying they are out of fries. \u00a0Anyways we said ok we'll take the bacalao croquettes. \u00a0She puts in our order, comes back and says we don't have any croquettes left. \u00a0Perfect! Ok no problem we'll enjoy the other tapas. \u00a0Right? Wrong!! When we started eating the sausage we realized these were barely heated up! We told the waitress, she apologized and said she'll bring out another portion. \u00a0Well, the top part of it was hot, the inside however was fridge cold!!! Meanwhile, the patatas bravas never arrived! \u00a0We gave up on this place. \u00a0We didn't touch the sausages! \u00a0We asked for the check and will never be returning. \u00a0I started observing closer and noticed that everybody there only had drinks in hand. \u00a0This place is definitely a drinking spot! If you are hungry do not come here!!!",
