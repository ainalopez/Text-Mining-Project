    "I have tried some other piadina places in Barcelona, and this one is so far the best one! They have whatever ingredient you might think of, and everything is really good, and fresh. One of the best things about this place is that they have got piadinas made of whole wheat flour and spelt! They don\u00b4t have a lot of space inside, but this is probably for the best - you can take your piadina with you and have it while enjoying the views on St. Pere\u00b4s church and the square around it.",
