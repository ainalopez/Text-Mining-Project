    "This was our best meal in Barcelona. We dined in November 2014. It is a mid-sized restaurant for sit-down dinners. It was a quiet night. There were only two other tables and a few locals that stopped by for a standing drink at the bar. The interior was very pretty. There is a brick wall with an interesting array of framed mirrors and art. The opposite walls were a pretty Mediterranean blue. The tables were marble and the features were tarnished metal. Very well done.The food was fresh, interesting and well-seasoned. We split a salad, pasta, entr\u00e9e, bottle of wine, dessert and dessert cocktails. The total cost was 70 euros. The standout was the house special steak tartare. At our table, the server mixed raw beef with a variety herbs and olive oil in a large bowl. He then split off four portions and mixed it with four different types of liquor. We were told to eat it like a flight, with the lightest flavored mix first to a build up of bold, spicy flavor last. The flavor profiles were interesting and the texture of the beef was amazing. It was served with bread, butter and ice cream to cleanse our palette between each mix. Truly amazing dish.",
