    "Awesome experience! Loved almost everything we tried. Had the server (who we nicknamed Spanish Adam Sandler, amongst ourselves) pick for us off the menu since we arrived at 9 and could still order off the menu. Later they walked things down the line and we picked off the plates too. Husband and I each had a couple beers and stuffed ourselves for \u20ac33! Fun!",
