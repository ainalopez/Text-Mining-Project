    "This is a great little restaurant to eat for some delicious tapas! It's another small restaurant that's popular in the area, so we did have a little bit of a wait. Fortunately, the wait was only about 20 minutes. The host came to us to see how we were doing every once in a while to chat. He kept us entertained during our wait.When we were finally seated, we were at the bar and the restaurant was pretty packed. He explained to us how the restaurant worked. After a couple minutes, the waitress came to serve us. All of the food is displayed on the bar. We went down the bar with the waitress explained what was being served. She explained each item that we asked about, then she put anything we decided we wanted on a plate. After we'd chosen what we wanted, she took the plates of our food to the cook to be plated. Everything was plated so nicely, and the food was delicious! I enjoyed our whole meal! We definitely ate with our eyes when we picked out food, so we were completely stuffed by the end of our meal!The only thing I didn't like was having to go behind people while they were eating to choose my food. It felt like it would be a little disruptive having people constantly standing behind you and pointing at the food to choose what they want. But I did really like the concept of being able to see all the food and getting to choose each item individually.It was really a great experience, and the food was delicious! If given the opportunity, I would definitely go back and eat there again!",
