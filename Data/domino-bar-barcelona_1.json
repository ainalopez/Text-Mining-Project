    "If ya want something kinda hidden and just off the main path this place is perfection. We came by sun 8ish so relatively early and grabbed a few drinks and were on a semi search for pizza to try cause there are just so many p-joints in Barcelona that ya kinda just wanna know after a while. Nice bar set up w a few stools but there are six or seven table seats as well. Yayyy allll I want to do after a long day of touring around town is to sit n binge. HehJust over 27\u20ac for three drinks, pizza (one size only but the equivalent of a medium), salad, chips n guac. All of which were freshly made n delic. total steal, esp compared to the crap joints out on the main strips. Plus, they have a mostly English (read carefully if ur a veggie eater!) menu for food so it's pretty darn easy to order \u00a0-- strangely, not for the drinks tho but it's easy enough to point to the pics on yelp or G translate it lol. Service is really friendly. Seems like a family owned joint and most people coming by seemed to know them. They also have a 40% off something checkin offer which I used. I couldn't understand the deets cause they were all in Spanish but when I got the bill it just looked like they comped a drink wooooohoo!",
