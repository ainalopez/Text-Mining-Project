    "Realllyy, really good vegan/vegetarian place. Loved the cute decor and low lighting! House wine was phenomenal and the stroganoff was to die for - it's been forever since I've had it (as gone vegan recently).... The server, Deep, was great, and totally in tune with what we should try! Thank you again Deep. If you are vegan or vegetarian or even in the mood to try something new this is def. the place to try for a nice dinner! I could only imagine breakfast at this place !",
