    "Been here multiple times, never disappoints! Great for an afterwork get together! In the summer it is packed immediately but still in a good way cause it's \u00a0in a pedestrian street only, so it has great atmosphere and people meet up there but not for too long. So one way or another you always find a spot, unless you're with a big group",
