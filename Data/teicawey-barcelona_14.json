    "Man. I *wish* I would have found this place sooner. I've been in Barcelona for four months and unfortunately only found this place with a week to go! Anyway, this definitely checks the box for awesome food at a good price. I've been there twice now to get burritos, and each one I've had (the Supercarnes and the Cubano I think) has been very good.For the Americans out there, if you want a Chipotle comparison, I would say that the burritos here are unquestionably better, and taste more natural and have more flavor. As another reviewer commented, the hot sauce selection is really good as well. In Spain, it's very difficult to find *actual* hot sauce so it was nice that this place had an assortment of them. Anyway, if you are here long term or even just swinging by Gracia for the day and hungry, I'd say it warrants a visit.",
