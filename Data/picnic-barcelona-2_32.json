    "Quite small but it wasn't packed when I went at 9 pm (they re-open at 8 pm after a break). Small-ish menu like everyone else has said but it has some good choices. I got the chile with beef that came with corn, chips, brie, and bread. The cream brie was really good and the chile/sour cream was quite good as well. Really liked the jazz music they played too.Portions aren't huge though!",
