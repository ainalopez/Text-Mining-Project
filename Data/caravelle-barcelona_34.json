    "Everything is made fresh and the menu is always reliably fantastic and unique but be prepared to wait a long time for it. The essence of Caravelle is hipster with poor/often rude service but I've kind of just had to try to accept it because especially their tacos, corn on cob and craft beer is just so good. It's probably the only place we've gone to multiple times and left because it is randomly closed or we weren't served after 15 mins sitting at a table (not so unusual in Spain) but that we keep coming back to because food is great.",
