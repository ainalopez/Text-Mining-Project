    "Delicious pizza, and I love that you can buy it by the slice for only 2 euro! My favorite is the potato rosemary with a white sauce. The sauce tastes authentic and not too garlicky like some white sauces. The pizzas with red sauce are also delicious! We've eaten there several times while I'm Barcelona, and after the first taste we were shocked at how good it was for being so affordable. Definitely our go-to place for pizza on the go! Also tried the tiramisu, but didn't care for it, as it tasted like cream with chocolate wafers, not espresso or cocoa or liquer. But the pizza is great! :)",
