    "It is everything that everyone says it is- loud, crowded, crazy, inexpensive and a fabulous experience! I would have gone back again but I think my friends were not really into waiting in a crowd for a place to stand in a crowd to eat (in a crowd) I also think that they felt lost because they could not order as there was no English menu and no one was speaking any either. The menu was actually in Catalan but I know enough Spanish to order sandwiches and wine. This place is not for those who can not push up to the front or make their needs known. It is also hard to find if you are not specifically looking for it.Pollo and queso Sandwhich toasted was fantastic along with a bottle of the blush cava. I thought I would have more than one Sandwhich but it was really all I could eat. My friends had the ham and cheese which was also good and made better with a squirt of the red sauce in a plastic bottle (roasted red pepper sauce maybe?)If you want relaxing move along. If you want to feel like you are at a Spanish house party this is your spot.",
