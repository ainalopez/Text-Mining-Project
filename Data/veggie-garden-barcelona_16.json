    "This place was amazing. I came twice when I was in Barcelona just to have their toasted bread with sundried tomato spread and arugula one more time because it was sooooo delicious!! and also to try their fresh squeezed juices which i had not done the first time. And oh man, I couldnt have made better juice myself. It was so fresh and delicious, and there is basically every combination you can imagine, the section for juices on the menu is endless! and you can also create your own. i like juice but its not something i would brag about, unless it was this amazing. and i cannot stress how delicious the appetizer is (toasted bread with sundried tomato paste and arugula - its a must have!)the first time i went i had an organic beer though, and a veggie burger. The beer was whatever, you can find it at any store that sells organic beer (its bottled), its definitely way more worth your money to get a juice. and the veggie burger was really good but its one of those really sloppy meals because they bread it made out of i dont know what natural product and comes apart easily. I didnt try anything else but the menu had a lot of options and i saw a lot of people ordering the indian dish, it seemed to be extremely popular. but i was not in the mood for indian food.the place also has wifi for those of you who travel with no service and only have connection through wifi!cheers!",
