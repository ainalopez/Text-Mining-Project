    "SEAFOOD PAELLA. We only had paella once in Spain and this was amazing. For the three of us, we got this huge pan with shrimp, clams, calamari, the rice that comes in paella, I'm drooling just thinking about it. We couldn't even finish it was so much. The only downside about this place is the lack of waiters who can speak English because we asked if we had to pay for bread and they said no but they ended up charging us in the end. Oh well. The view of the pier is beautiful and the restaurant is lovely",
