    "AN ABSOLUTE GEM! EARNS ITS 5 STAR REVIEWS!!!We went there for dinner just before 8, and thankfully had reservations because this restaurant fills up. The staff was very courteous and all played with our 2 year old even though they were super busy.The food, however, is truly the star of the experience. If I could give it 6 stars, I would.Right off the bat, the olives served before the meal set the tone. An incredible assortment of Spanish black and green olives each more delicious than the other (we ordered seconds of that too :) )We selected the ceviche and scallops as our entrees and the paella (for 2) as our mains. Without question, the best tapas we have ever had. Hallelujah! Perfectly cooked scallops with a killer sauce, and the most flavorful and refreshing ceviche that had layers of flavor even in its simplicity.If it was even possible, the paella was even better than the tapas. We were just blown away by the freshness and seasoning of the seafood, and the perfectly cooked rice (that tasted like the ocean) to accompany it. Even the color of the paella was incredibly appetizing (see our pics).Our bill for the dinner was about \u20ac60 without alcohol. Very reasonable for the seafood we ate, and a steal considering the skill of the chef/kitchen.We will be going back to this restaurant again in a day or so.",
