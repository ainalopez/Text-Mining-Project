    "You can get tapas and a sandwich anywhere, but if you want something that might change your outlook on life then come here. The chipirones (squid) omelette is the marquise item and is worth every penny. Ill probably have dreams about this place in the future. Even if you don't like sea food then you can get the classic jamon omelette sandwich and it'll be the best you've ever had. Can't say enough or give thanks enough for this meal!",
