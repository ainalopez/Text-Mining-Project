    "This is truly a great spot, especially for lunch. It's such a cute restaurant and there's outdoor seating in an adorable piazza. The food is good but not outstanding. I ate the cod with pistachios and it was nice but nothing to remember. the service was great too. Honestly I think it's a terrific place to have a nice lunch in a beautiful place. I went alone and it was perfect to just relax a little and be comfortable.",
