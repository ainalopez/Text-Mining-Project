    "I have to eat as much \"tapas\" in Barca as I can when I'm there. That means I try to eat pinxo at bars whenever I can, more \"tapasy\" places like Cal Pep (or whatever u like) when I can, and more modern takes on the tapas concept like are found here. This place was great. Often reviews mention the friendly waitstaff and we found that to be 100% true: follow their guidance and they will steer you to some great dishes. I am particularly happy with this place for one major reason: it's open on SUNDAY when 9 of 10 Barca restaurants are closed. So if life finds you here and hungry on Sunday (or any other day) you will be pleased to be here.",
