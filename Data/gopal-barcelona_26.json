    "This was a really cute place me and my sister found in Barcelona. I'm most definitely not vegan at all (I loveeee meat) so I was a little skeptical at first but the food definitely changed my mind. The burgers are delicious. So are the donuts! And I definitely recommend ordering some patatas bravas if you've never tried them before. Everything here was really cheap too. There are also fruit popsicles which are refreshing on a hot day.",
