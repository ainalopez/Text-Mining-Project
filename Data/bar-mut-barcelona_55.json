    "Just ate there tonight. Do not eat here unless you want to be completely ripped off. While the food is pretty good, the service was incredibly rude and unhelpful. Our waiter refused to explain how dishes were prepared beyond tryig to get us to order fish, steak etc. - even though he spoke perfect English. I can't remember ever being treated that badly in a restaurant, EVER!",
