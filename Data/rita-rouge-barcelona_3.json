    "A sexy looking, more esteemed restaurant and bar. My wife and I stopped by late one evening and the patio seating was still very busy at 10:30pm. We both had an appy and a drink, very disappointed. The quality of the food here does not seem to match the high prices compared to the many numerous food options around the Las Ramblas area. Huge disappointment, would NOT recommend this restaurant.",
