    "We went here after hearing about this place from some friends who visited Barcelona a few weeks before us. It's a little dark inside, but this doesn't detract from the experience. The food here was excellent. Everything is fresh and very tasty. We had a plate of cheeses which were all great. The bread with crushed tomatoes and olive oil was excellent, too, and the Hummus here was one of the best I've ever had. The wine choices are good, and bottles are not expensive at all. Two people can have a meal and wine for under \u20ac40!",
