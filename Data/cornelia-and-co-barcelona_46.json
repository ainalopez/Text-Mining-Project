    "Looks are deceiving. Restaurant is beautiful but the eaitstaff is not! I am not referring to how they look because that is of no consequence. How they behave is another matter. The word that comes to mind is non-commital. You order it or you don't, you like it, eh maybe you won't but who cares! Also, be wary of the man and woman who carve the complementary bits of ham and bring to your table; they cough alot , pick their noses, scratch their ears, rub their faces and then serve you your food! Yummy, right?, watched the ham man all afternoon scratch face snd sneak bits of ham. Too many other places to try.",
