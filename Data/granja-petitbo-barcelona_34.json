    "Big fan! I didn't peg Barcelona to be a great brunch city, but it keeps on surprising me. This place has a great menu and lots of tasty juices to choose from. I had a pear, spinach, lemon and ginger juice which was on special that was fantastic. My friend ordered the huevos rancheros which in her words \"are the best you could get in Barcelona\" while I had the caesar salad and was not disappointed. I'd definitely go back!",
