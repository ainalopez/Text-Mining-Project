    "Hmmmm... Still a great place but looking a little tatty on the outside now (graffiti all over the shopfront). Also, I had the seitan burger and the bread was almost inedible. It was so dry and difficult to swallow that I needed to take the burger out and eat it without the bun. A shame as my non-Vegan friend had ordered the same and wasn't impressed. The other dishes and drinks were great though and it's still excellent value for money.",
