    "This little cozy restaurant has found itself one of those secret charming spots in Barcelona, in one of the most beautiful streets in Les Corts. The restaurant holds no more than 30 seats, yet what it lacks in space it makes up in charm. The food will satisfy those who look for the not-so-exotic but also those looking to fill their mouths with the taste of southeast Asia. The price is reasonable and you can have a lunch menu for just 10\u20ac. The only con I can think of is that they serve little (33cl) water bottles and given that the food can be very hot, you will need to order at least a couple.",
