    "Gasterea is always there when you need it! For a pintxo fix, when you want to show visitors an authentic spot without leaving the neighborhood, for an upbeat personal dining experience with txakoli!!Don't expect a sit down meal, expect to stand and laugh and let the waiters recommend the hot out of the kitchen pintxos or the cold ones on display while pouring Basque wine across the room into your glass!",
