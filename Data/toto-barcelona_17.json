    "Great Italian food with a Spanish twist. \u00a0The marinara sauce in the pasta dish we had was simply superb, as was the roasted lamb. \u00a0Enjoyed the service -- polite and helpful even with the language barrier. \u00a0 (some reviewers below found the service to be stand-offish, but that's just the European flavor of service \u00a0:-)).",
