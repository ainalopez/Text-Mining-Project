    "We had a fantastic paella lunch here over looking the water. It gets quite popular around 2pm and seafood is definitely the go to item. We started with the most phenomenal clams in a garlic and ham sauce that was reminiscent of a gravy. They were probably the best clams I've ever had.Then we shared 1 order of the fishermans paella. They present it in skillet and it's filled with an array of shellfish: mussels, clams, shrimp etc. It had such a wonderful flavor, and we devoured it!Service was fine and the people watching is great. It is pricey! I definitely recommend sitting outside!",
