    "This lounge restaurant is pretty much one of the coolest venues I've been to in Barcelona. It's hip and trendy to the max and is located right along the beach \u00a0 \u00a0just steps away. You walk downstairs into the restaurant and you're immediately transported into another world. It morphs into a variety of feelings from exclusivity to romantic- this place just exudes luxury but in the most inviting way.Food is somewhat of a fusion between Asian/Japanese cuisine and Mediterranean/Arabic with your choice of either or. Staff is cutting edge- Hostess and waitresses are trendsetters and attractive. Two very sharp combinations that leave you wondering if you're in a James Bond film. While waiting for our meal, I noticed two of these bond girls massaging people at the table. This of course peaked our curiosity so we called them over to ask. Massages are about 5-10 minutes and they work on tips. Reasonable tip would most likely be anywhere from $10 euros and up depending how much you enjoyed your head, face and ear massage...LOL Meals were excellent and we moved over to the lounge area afterwards where they had cleared up the area and had a DJ set up. It was house music and there was not much changing from there, which was my only setback. I would have enjoyed a little more variety but again the place has such a cool vibe I won't dare knock a star off because of it. This place is a definite must if you're in Barcelona!",
