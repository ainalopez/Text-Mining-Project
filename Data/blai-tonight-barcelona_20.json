    "We went here based on Jodie's review and weren't disappointed. It was a little intimidating at first as the place was jammed when we got there around 10 PM, but my wife and I just plowed and went for it. \u00a0Here's what you need to do:1) be confident and work your way up to the front if it is crowded.2) ask for a plate (they'll give you a little plastic cup for your toothpicks too) and order your drinks/beer.3) just grab the tapas you want (or ask them to get one if it is far away) and save your toothpicks in the cup (you can ask to have your tapas heated in the microwave if you want)4) When you're done, give your cup to one of the guys behind the bar and tell him how many drinks you had.It's all based on an honor system which I really like and everything is only 1 Euro per toothpick. \u00a0My wife and I stuffed ourselves and had two big beers each and we spent less than 20 Euro total.Food is constantly coming out so I recommend grabbing one or two things at a time and seeing what else comes out. \u00a0If a plate comes out and you see everyone going for it, get in there and get one. \u00a0The best stuff goes very quickly. \u00a0The food that is on bottom level is usually older so I would suggest only getting food on the top of the counter if you want the best/freshest food.We went to a lot of restaurants and bars, but this one will be the most memorable for us. \u00a0If you're in the area, this is definitely worth a visit.",
