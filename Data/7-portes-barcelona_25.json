    "I heard this was one of Barcelona's most famous restaurants. I'm guessing with its long history and presence in the community - they no longer have to emphasize quality or service. Food was overpriced and meh at best. Definitely overhyped and under-delivered. The rich man's paella was the only reason this place got an additional star. Otherwise it would have been one.Here's what we ordered:- Catalunya spinach starter (so like steamed, frozen? spinach for \u20ac12)- Mariner mussels (not bad actually)- Catalan sausage (good, if you want high blood pressure)- Vegetable paella (so like Campbells soup over rice?)- Rich man's paella (we ordered two but only got one? This was good though so if you fall for this place, I'd get this)Service was muy mala. Like pretty shit because let's be real - you always justify paying for higher end dining for the service.Nah no - I wouldn't come here.",
