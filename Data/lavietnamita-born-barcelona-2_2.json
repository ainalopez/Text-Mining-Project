    "I wanted to love this place, the decor and ambiance is great, friendly staff, everything looked great on the menu. But food was meh - not bad, but just not very flavorful. It seems like food is lacking seasoning and def lacking spices. I wouldn't turn down a meal there, but I also wouldn't take a visiting guest there.",
