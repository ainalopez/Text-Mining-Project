    "Eggsellent brunch (pun intended). I had the huevos horneados (baked eggs), which came in a ramekin mixed with very flavorful chorizo, cheese, and grilled peppers. Utensils consisted of two generous slices of hearty toast, and so a beautiful relationship between grain and huevos was born. I also consumed a salted caramel latte in record time. Our server was lovely and the atmosphere was very modern but comfortable, and it seemed like everyone else eating there was from England, which is \u00a0great because Brits have sophisticated taste. Ace!",
