    "Ambiance is great and nice servers. Very helpful and multi-lingual. Service is pretty normal in BCN--long wait for cheque, have to flag then down for things. But sill attentive. The food was fine but not memorable. BIG PROBLEM is, the prices on the menu were different from cheque. Salad with shrimp & bacon-VERY GOOD! I recommend. Listed for two at \u20ac11 but on the bill it was \u20ac13,90 or \u20ac13,somethingPakora tapas-pretty good. Listed for \u20ac7 and was \u20ac8 or \u20ac9 on the billPaneer Tikka-basically just fried cheese dish. Better to mix this with something like lamb or veggies. Listed for \u20ac8 I think and was charged \u20ac9,something.I can't remember exact prices but I know they were all \u20ac1-3 more than listed and that's before tax.We didn't want to ruin the evening by arguing over a bill. It was a nice ambience and good service. But really, keep the bill honest!Also the music is terrible, even for Indian music. Too much whistles in the songs and screeching. I've been to India, it's not like that",
