    "I don't know how this place has 4+ stars. Had the worst meal of my week in Barcelona here. I asked for tips on what was good and was given a selection of three items:Croquettes, which were deep-fried balls of mashed ham and some other mystery. Not good. A pizza-like thing, flavorless and tasted/looked like it was just in a plastic bag and frozen minutes earlier. And some sort of cheese plate/Brie thing that I actually don't remember too much about. Fortunately my brain didn't retain many memories about it. These were the best three things on their menu, apparently. Staff was very nice and the Estrellas are cold. I'd recommend coming for a cold beer and nothing else.",
