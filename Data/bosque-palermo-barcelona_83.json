    "Great place! We came with a group of 8, and they gave us a table upstairs that was completely secluded (although the AC was off and it was pretty hot). We got a bunch of seafood paella, the assorted meat platter, the assorted fish platter, and the prawns. The seafood paella was very good although it was my first time trying paella and I'm not sure that I'm a huge fan of the flavor. The assorted meat platter was pretty good, and the assorted fish platter was DELICIOUS and only 16 euros. It came with soooo much seafood: mussels, clams, a king prawn, salmon, baby octopi, squid, etc. The prawn dish was definitely overpriced and just okay. We also got 3 750ml bottles of wine for 3.50 each (what a deal!).Our waiter was also very nice and very impatient with us Americans, and he also let us split the check was was great. Overall a great restaurant with very reasonable prices!",
