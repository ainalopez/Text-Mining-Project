    "went here on a Rick Steves recommendation, and was so glad we did! \u00a0We were looking for a small plates dinner, and this turned out to be the perfect thing. \u00a0They had all of the tapas on display, which made me really excited to try things! \u00a0We had wine, and the house wine was quite good. We sat at the bar, and our server was very nice and helpful. \u00a0 Great place to enjoy a meal or for a quick drink and tapas before continuing your evening!",
