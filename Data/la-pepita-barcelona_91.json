    "Well I was referred to this location food is good but not as other places around is more like a fancy restaurant with super expensive tapas and pepitas. I spent more than $145 + 18% tip sucks .Euros is like $165 dollars for 4 people we all enjoy food but wait for 45 minutes to be seated another 30 minutes to be served at the end we were hungry very small plates not coming back.Previously to this restaurant we pass by xiutat congal we eat loy more many plates , calamari, belloya, paella, 2 drinks each assembly delicious super cheap $115 with tip 18% euro's for all $ 117 dollars .The point is look around don't go for the first place that impresses you there is so many restaurants around ahh I forgot SPANISH FOOD IS REALLY GOOD just find the right price for you. \u00a0Madrid has MUSEO DEL JAM\u00d3N MY FAVORITE.La pepita. LA CARITA= THE EXPENSE ONE.",
