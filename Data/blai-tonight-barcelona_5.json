    "Amazing tapas for cheap. It's an honour system where each tapas is 1 euro (the ones with red on it are their special tapas for 1.50 euros) and you have to keep your toothpicks (1 per tapas). When you pay they just count your toothpicks and drinks, then charge accordingly. They take credit and the food itself is amazing. I went here two nights in a row and was not disappointed. The great thing is that they have so much variety that you could eat here 4 nights in a row and still be trying out new things every time. Went around 9 and 10pm both nights and the place was busy each night, but not packed - you could still get a spot. This place is a must to get an authentic tapas experience.",
