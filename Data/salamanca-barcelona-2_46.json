    "This is really a fabulous place -- one of the best seafood meals I've had. \u00a0I have not seen lobster prepared so nicely, cut in half so it's easy to pull it out, and very fresh. \u00a0The traditional Catalan fish in the seafood platter was wonderful, as was the wine. \u00a0The waiter recommended wines based on our tastes and did not push us to the most expensive ones as so many others do. \u00a0Quantities are enormous -- think about ordering less than the number of people you have and sharing. \u00a0It's expensive, but you get what you pay for and this is worth it. \u00a0There is music at the table with traditional Catalan songs, and photos of your party. \u00a0It's an experience, one worth trying.",
