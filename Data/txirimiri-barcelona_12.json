    "Solid place near Jaume I. They serve up pintxos for 1.50 euros each I believe, which makes it the cheapest pintxos place I've seen to date. Their prices don't get too high either...if you decide to get their most expensive dish it may be around 15 euros. The quality is quite decent, and they have pretty good burgers there as well.",
