    "Stumbled into this place looking for a snack and it was really good!!! Nice people, bright and sunny! We got the mini hamburgers which were amazing. Cooked perfectly and had some yummy caramelized onions on it. Everything else we saw at other tables looked pretty impressive too. We were very happy to find this place!",
