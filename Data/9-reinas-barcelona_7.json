    "Good steaks, and side dishes. The size of the dishes is very large, so we shared dishes and the number of the main courses was 60% of the number of our party, and it was enough.The service is amazing! Very friendly staff, and they keep checking on us predicting what we would need next.If you are in town and have the time, then you would enjoy lunch in here.",
