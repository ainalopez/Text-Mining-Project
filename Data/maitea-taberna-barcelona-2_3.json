    "\u00a1Bienvenido a Espa\u00f1a! What better way to kick off a series of Spain reviews than with a tasty tapas location? Maitea is a Basque style restaurant and tavern. You can order tapas and Pintxos to your heart's content, and even pick up some items from the bar if you like.So what to order? I defaulted to Yelp, as usual. As a result we ordered 3 good choices. The **Dates with Bacon** appeared in several reviews, so we tried them and they were pretty much what we expected. Very similar to the U.S. version. We also got the **Artichoke Heart Croquettes** and these were pretty mind blowing. Such juicy goodness! You can't go wrong in Spain with the third and final Yelper-recommended dish, **Jamon Iberico** with the traditional Tomato Rubbed Bread.The highlight of the meal for me was the **Codfish with garlic mousseline au gratin**. I've never had anything quite like it before! The garlic mousseline perfectly complimented the fish and wasn't too overwhelming. This dish was actually recommended by the server. Good call! Service here is helpful and has a decent comprehension of English.One of the things I love about Barcelona is they offer peach juice everywhere. The stuff is deliciously refreshing after a long day of walking and shopping. This place is about a 5-10 minute cab ride from the Passeig de Gracia shopping area.TIP: The tapas/Pintxos here are larger than at most other tapas places in Barcelona, so plan accordingly. Four of us were stuffed after 5 tapas.DATE TIP: There is a check-in offer here for a free shot. Impress your date with your Yelpiness by checking in and getting the hookup for free booze!",
