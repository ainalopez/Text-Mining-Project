    "Great evening with some good food and a relaxed atmosphere. \u00a0This was a recommendation from the concierge of the hotel and it did not disappoint. \u00a0Food was reasonably priced and the quality was very high. Service was good and the usual Barcelona pace, although I must say the food did come out relatively fast. We chose the tapas option and went with a medley of choices. \u00a0Starting with a tomato and mozzarella salad with basil pesto style dressing.. \u00a0Tomatoes were firm and juicy and mozzarella was soft and yielding but clearly fresh fresh.... \u00a0The octopus was on a bed of sliced potatoes and was cooked with some zest op red pepper. \u00a0It worked well and gave the calamari a nice flavor. The fried eggplant with honey was tasty although at times felt too oily...perhaps a side of something or more honey would have helped. Anchovies were very tasty indeed and were served with some toasted bread. Salty as expected but deep flavor and not overpoweringly fishy. The grilled artichokes with chopped Iberia ham was delightfully complex with the salt of the ham draing out the grilled artichoke flavors. \u00a0Great experience. \u00a0Will be back.",
