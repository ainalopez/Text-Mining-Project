    "This restaurant was located across the street from my hotel.i stopped by for dinner twice wine it was very convenient and was not a tourist trap along La Rambla. The food and service was very good. I rated as 3 stars simply because I had as good, if not better food for a lower price within a 10 minute walk of Lobo. \u00a0One added benefit was that I was close enough to pull a wi-fi signal from my hotel. \u00a0Very helpful when trying to post several pictures to Instagram using my international data plan.",
