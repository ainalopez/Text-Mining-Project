    "This place is perfect for when you do not have time to dine until late and want something quick, healthier and filling. Yes they do only offer a falafel, salad or potato fries, but this narrow selection ensures rapidness while maintaining the freshness and taste. Plus, you can top your falafel with as many toppings as you can fit onto it! And all for a very good price. The salad toppings were fresh even later in the day and were all refilled. The place was clean and the service was great. This is how I imagine the ideal fast-food restaurant.",
