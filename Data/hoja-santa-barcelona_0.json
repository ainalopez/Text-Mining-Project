    "Amazing 1 Michelin star restaurant!!! It's mainly Mexican food, but definitely has fusion influences from other cuisines. We had the tasting menu at \u20ac98 and that's the way to go. It gives you a chance to try out all their famous dishes. Each course is a bite size sample, and all beautifully presented. My favorites are the crispy Hoja leaf (also the name of the restaurant), avocado gazpacho, sea urchin guacamole, and their beautiful desserts. Their cocktail menu is also quite delicious. Ask the waiter for recommendations!",
