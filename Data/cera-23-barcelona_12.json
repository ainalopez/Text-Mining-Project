    "Nice and cosy restaurant a short stroll away from the busy Ramblas. Be early or get a reservation as it fills up quickly in the late evening. The food was quite fine for the price but don't expect a fine dining experience. We had the foie gras ravioli, mushroom risotto, tempura shrimp, tuna tartar, and some desserts. Both the ravioli and the risotto could have used another minute in the pan and some more salt, but again, this is not fine dining. The signature blackberry mojitos were awesome.",
