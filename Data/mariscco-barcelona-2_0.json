    "This is honestly my favorite restaurant in the city. \u00a0Every visit we come here, this last time we even went two nights in a row! \u00a0You choose your own fresh seafood so you can have a selection of everything if you want. \u00a0The lobster paella is out of this world! \u00a0Our go to meal for 2 of us is always fried calamari, lobster paella, a bottle of Pero Verde and dessert. \u00a0That adds up to about \u20ac75, which is a bargain for the quality. \u00a0Service is always good and prompt, never any complaints there and the food comes out quick.",
