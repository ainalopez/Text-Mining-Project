    "Every time I visit Barcelona, this is the restaurant I must visit. Reservations are mostly a must because the place becomes packed on weekends after 3 pm and also after 8pm. I had the bacalao with lemon sauce which is just amazing. When you order a burger rare...it is literally cooked for seconds and served pretty much raw. The quality is so great that you can taste the freshness. I would highly recommend you make your way out of the main city into this somewhat quiet Poblenou neighborhood for some amazing restaurants away from tourist traps.",
