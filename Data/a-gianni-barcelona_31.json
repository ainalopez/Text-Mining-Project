    "Outstanding food and service. Had the bruschetta, fried cheese and warm bread for starters. Salad and filet mignon were delicious for entres. So was our well-priced bottle of red wine. Service is charming and friendly. Desserts outstanding as well, and more diverse than just tiramisu. Prices are fair. Hope to return soon!",
