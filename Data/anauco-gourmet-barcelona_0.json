    "Definitely the best burgers in all of Spain and one of the best burgers I have had anywhere in the world! The staff were very friendly. The restaurant carries a nice selection of local beers. Only negative from my experience was they happened to run out of tequila the day we were there so I did not get the chance to try the margaritas which they make using a lemon sorbet.",
