    "This is one of the best tapas place I've tried in Barcelona! Everything the waiter recommended was delicious. They seem to have the tendency of mixing sweet and savory together and the result is marvelous! I would recommend their foie gras with white chocolate(I know!), patatas bravas, and pumpkin with honey and fresh cheese!",
