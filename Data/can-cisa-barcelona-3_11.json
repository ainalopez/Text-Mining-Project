    "Found this small hole in the wall by luck. So we didn't have reservations l waitress let us sit at the Bar. We didn't know what to order. Our server Borja was awesome told him the kind of Wine we wanted. Picked out a nice white. We ordered a few tapas and he had them for us within 5minutes. We weren't planning on ordering Desert but Borja started telling us and they sounded great. When we return to Barcelona. We are totally coming back here. The vibe was great my kind of spot.",
