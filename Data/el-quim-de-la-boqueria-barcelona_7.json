    "I ordered the BocaQUIM even though my seat mates were eating everything from fish and eggs with beer, to chocolate desserts with coffee and cognac! It's wonderful to eat with people who will eat and drink anything they like at 11 AM :)The BocaQUIM may be the best hot sandwich I have ever eaten! It's the perfect brunch combination of toasted bread, caramelized onion with Modena balsamic, asparagus, egg, and pork loin. I'm craving it again!For only 6.50 EUROS or about $7.50, it was quite large and I only finished this because it was so good, and also because I had a wonderful glass of natural cava with it for under 4 EUROS or $5 USD. Most of their other specialties are in the 20 Euro range but they are generous servings and my neighbors at the counter all finished their dishes with relish. I had already devoured half the sandwich by the time they delivered my glass:)",
