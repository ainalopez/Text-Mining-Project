    "One of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona. Yes it is on the more expensive side, but it is also one of the best meals you will ever have. For starters the restaurant itself has a really nice vibe to it. It is exactly like an upscale bodega. It is incredibly inviting, quaint, and stylish. \u00a0My boyfriend and I ate our lunch at the piano with the piano stool as our table, which I actually found innovative and charming. The service was also very attentive, which is not incredibly common in Barcelona. I have been to upscale restaurants in barcelona where that is not the case. Now on to the most important part- the meal. We started with a small glass of beer, which they told us every meal starts with. I am not sure if this is always the case, but they immediately gave it to us. \u00a0We then ordered a delicious white wine that the waiter suggested (their wine list is huge) and paired it with octopus, egg carpaccio, and the best lobster I have ever had. Yes this place is expensive, but it is well worth it. \u00a0However it is important to note that there is no menu, or at least we were not given one, the waiter tells you what they have for the day, but does not tell you prices. (I am sure they would if you asked)Our lunch for 2 was around 120 euro.",
