    "This place was a recommendation from a friend and we were not disappointed. \u00a0It is a hole in the wall and is very crowded with tight, close seating. \u00a0It is very noisy as well, but for some reason pleasant. \u00a0We each ordered the lunch special which consisted of wine, soup or salad, main course, and dessert. \u00a0Everything was delicious. \u00a0The pig leg is very fatty, so I don't recommend that, but was tasty nonetheless.",
