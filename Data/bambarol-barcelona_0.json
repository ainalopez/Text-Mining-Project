    "I sure being ranked #6 on Trip Advisor has something to do with this place being fully booked with reservations every night of the week that I've come here so far. \u00a0So as to be sure you don't get turned away, try to snag a table at the bar right when they open at eight, or be sure to come with reservations. I saw at least 3-4 couples turned away each night I was here this week. Definitely better than your average Tapas restaurant. \u00a0Dish recommendations can be a bit difficult since some of the items are seasonal. \u00a0If they still have the Cappesante which is the scallops, asparagus, and pork jowls, this is a must order. The pork ribs yakitori special was also exceptional. If you're on a budget and have a hearty appetite, the patatas bravas can help tide you over. \u00a0And if you're not on a campaign against carbs, you should order the patatas bravas as well. Finally, while the lamb and the steak tataki were well prepared, I would recommend trying some of the other dishes if you're looking for something more adventurous flavor wise.",
