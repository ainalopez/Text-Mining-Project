    "Wow, I'm really shocked that 1) there's only one other review of this place, and 2) that it's such a bad one, considering that our experience was so good! They're located right near the entrance to the La Boqueria Market and we were told they get their ingredients fresh daily from there. Our waiter was super friendly, helping us decide on dishes and always checking back to make sure our food was to our liking. We had the paella, a mushroom dish [delish!], patatas fritas [ordered this twice!] and a bean and bacon dish cooked in olive oil that was uh-mazing! Oh, and their version of the tinto de verano [a popular summer drink in Spain] was so good we almost went back just for that! We'll definitely be returning for a meal the next time we're in Barcelona.",
