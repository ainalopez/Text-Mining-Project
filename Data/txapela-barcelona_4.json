    "TAPAS. TAPAS. TAPAS. \u00a0BCN is known for this, and this place really showcases it very well. \u00a0Went here for a light lunch, and they sell tapas only! No main courses! \u00a0If you opt to sit inside, you will pass by a bar of all the different cold tapas they sell, and they're made very fresh with such complex ingredients and flavors. \u00a0Instead of a traditional menu, they have a placemat of all the different tapas they offered both hot and cold. \u00a0I want to say there were about 80+ different types ranging from a traditional potato dish to octopus. \u00a0Each of the tapas ranged about 1-4 Euros each. \u00a0I really enjoy seafood and raw items, so all of my items came from the cold section (pictures attached). \u00a0I will say that the price per tapas is a little on the steep side. \u00a0You might be wondering why I say that as 1-4 euros doesn't sound like much but the portion is super tiny. \u00a0I ordered an octopus skewer, and that already was 3 euros for such small pieces. \u00a0It really felt like super mini appetizers and not traditional tapas where you can share with others. \u00a0It's definitely a single person thing.",
