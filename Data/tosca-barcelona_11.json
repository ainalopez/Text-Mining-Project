    "Given the good reviews here on Yelp, we were a little disappointed. The tapas was indeed yummy and initially the service was friendly but once we ordered the food it felt like we were being rushed to churn over the table. Each plate of food was plonked down in quick succession with no introduction and empty plates quickly taken away. There was no friendly interaction to be had with staff after that initial order. Without an offer of dessert or coffee, we just paid the bill and left, buying ice cream on the way home instead.",
