    "Great location just of the ramblas near the market. Very nice interior and relaxed atmosphere. Very busy during lunch, but the friendly waiter took our reservation and told up to return after a quarter of an hour, which worked for us. They serve very nice tapas (tempura asparagus) and seafood rice dishes and have a wonderful selection of cakes.. Definitely worth a visit!",
