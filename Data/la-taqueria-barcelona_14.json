    "We are from San Diego, California, so we have eaten some pretty good Mexican food. Our group rated this among the top Mexican food that we have eaten. The owners are from Mexico, and they bring the culture and authentic food with them to Spain. The hot sauces are very spicy, complemented by the soothing taste of the guacamole.",
