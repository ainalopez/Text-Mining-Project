    "I want all the Flautas! O and one of those eggs and chips.. It may sounds odd but it's delicioussss! The food was served quickly and it was delicious. If you are in the area come you have to try it.. The sangria was refreshing with good fruit garnish and not to sweet. Try to call and make a reservation because this place gets busy. The service was great!Enjoy,",
