    "Discovered during my first stay in Barcelona, I did not hesitate and went again each time we visited Barcelona.In a comfortable place, with a sober but chic decoration, we always envoyed fresh products, and yummy tapas recipes, either traditional or innovative.We also enjoy the good wine selection.A very satisfactory tapas experience !However, I need to say we did not like that much the same Taller de Tapas located in Ciutat Vela...",
