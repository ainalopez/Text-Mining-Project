    "This place is just plain amazing. Everything we had was just so delicious and tasty, even deceptively simple looking things like chickpeas - best chickpeas in my life. ever. It's really popular, and there isn't a lot of seating, but definitely wait your turn for a seat and you won't regret it. We ordered the clams with egg, chickpeas, a sausage and for dessert the cheese with honey. The clams were so so so tasty, I've raved about the chickpeas, and the sausage was just oh so juicy. The dessert and coffee were a perfect way to round off a perfect meal. Don't miss out on this culinary gem!",
