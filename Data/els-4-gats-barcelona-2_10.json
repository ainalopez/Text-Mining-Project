    "This place looks like it has a lot of character, but I'll never know about the quality of their food. The host was about to seat me when he turned his back on me and walked away to help a massively large tour group. That told me all I needed to know about this place - poor service and an emphasis on catering to tour groups. I walked out and never looked back.",
