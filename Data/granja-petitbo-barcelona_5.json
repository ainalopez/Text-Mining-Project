    "A relaxed yet trendy cafe with that mis-matched chic vibe that is associated with hipsterdom. \u00a0We sat a big sharing table with a cute family.The juices are awesome here. Creative flavours that work perfectly. The cakes in the display cabinet looked so tempting but \u00a0we decided to order some brunch off the menu. The heuvos ranchos were awesome - spicy and generous! I loved the smoked salmon pizza - it was very light and refreshing but again, a massive serving.Prices were slightly higher than normal but no where near what you would expect to pay for such large servings of delicious brunch food where I am from (Melbourne.)The waiters were also lovely and only spoke spanish with a little bit of English, which I loved as I got to practice my Spanish. They were so friendly and welcoming too. This is a great place to experience a trendy Barcelona brunch!",
