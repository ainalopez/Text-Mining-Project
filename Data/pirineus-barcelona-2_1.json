    "Had a few tapas here with friends during a temporary tapas route that was going on in Gracia. This place looked really good, and was certainly packed full of people to convince me that it was a worthwhile stop. The servers were super friendly and bilingual, and the location of the restaurant was great, but the chefs seemed to buckling under the strain of so many orders. Our food was tasty, but it seemed to have been sitting out for a while (or had not been warmed up adequately). It was pretty good, and I would be keen to try out more of their menu...but might not go back on particularly busy nights. 3 stars for the food and an extra star for the super awesome service.",
