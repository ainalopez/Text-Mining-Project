    "Went here this evening off TA recommendation. Only about 16 covers with tables setup for 2 and 4. \u00a0Set on a corner with doors on both streets and ceiling fans helped move the air exactly enough to stay cool but keep the atmosphere often killed by air conditioning.It was an intimate setting and the host, Gabriella couldn't have been sweeter. After choosing some dishes off the menu & the specials, we weren't sure between 2 wines so asked for guidance. \u00a0Gabriella came out with the 2 bottles, explained the grapes and regions and had us taste the 2 to help with our choice - can't remember the last time that happened!Despite the kitchen being tiny we were served great food, dish after dish. \u00a0We explored some more wines, ordered some more food and then dessert.Highlights: Mango/goat's cheese/walnut salad; provolone cheese with walnuts; calamari croquettes (yes, calamari - exquisite and delicate); apple cake like a cross between tarte tatin and Norwegian apple cake - soft, warm with hints of cinnamon and a pastry-cakey base. Mmm. All in all 6 dishes, 6 glasses of wine, 57 Euros. What a great way to spend an evening. Thanks Gabriella (and chef).",
