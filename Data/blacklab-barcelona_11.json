    "Delicious lunch! The beers were excellent. I had the pink lady which is a fruit beer. It was delicious! We had spring rolls for an appetizer. They had tofu in them and were very yummy. I had the portobello mushroom burger. It was tasty. It also came with fries and some delicious dipping sauce. I also sampled the Reuben which was tasty, it wasn't like your typical Reuben more of a pulled pork, but it was still delicious. Staff are very nice and speak pretty good English. Overall, it was a good stop!",
