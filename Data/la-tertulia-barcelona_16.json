    "Decided to give a try ...seems this place got good reviews. Not our experience !!! Food was mediocre. The arugula already turned yellow and they still served to us!! The waiter came back and told us they didn't have 3 of the tapas we ordered. Meat of kebob was tough and dry...Very disappointed!",
