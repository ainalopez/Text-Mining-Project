    "There is very little not to like about Ziryab! I have been to many places for sheesha and this is hands down the best - the most serene, the most inviting, enchanting and 'out of a classic' picture kind of place. Nestled in a narrow alley within the gothic district of Barcelona, steps away from the sea yet miles away from all that Gaudi created though perhaps very aptly in Gaudi's city exhibiting artistic brilliance! Even if you do not smoke, come if only to have a drink on the balcony or the devan and to take in the space. The only regret I had was that the food was not befitting of the place. The hummus and the baba ganoush were good but not great - perhaps better to not be offered than to dilute everything great about this place. The sheesha was good also but then I personally think I make better(if I say so myself:)) and besides the place sets high expectations that are difficult to surpass!All in all I'm in love!!",
