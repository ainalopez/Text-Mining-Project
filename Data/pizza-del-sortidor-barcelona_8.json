    "My husband and I went here for dinner on the recommendation of our host, who lives in Poble-Sec. We were dubious when he mentioned that the owners were from Venezuela (not exactly a country synonymous with great pizza), but we were happy we checked it out. I had the Diavolo, which was slightly spicy and delicious, and my husband had the Margherita, another solid choice. Thin crust, quality ingredients--all served piping hot for about 6-8 euros each. We also loved the casual atmosphere. It was busy when we went, but we pulled up two stools at the bar, and the service was great. Overall, we couldn't have had a better experience.",
