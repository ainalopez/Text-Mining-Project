    "A chain offering basic Spanish cuisine (sandwiches, meat and cheese plates, drinks and pastries). \u00a0This is a restaurant that offers small plates but when you combine a few you can have a nice lunch or meal. We had two sandwiches and salads and left full. \u00a0The chorizo sandwich and legumbres salad were my favorites.",
