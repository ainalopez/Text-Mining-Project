    "This is a great little restaurant hidden in a alley way in the heart of Barcelona! The staff here speak little English, but are very warm and welcoming. They are known for their unique and authentic Spanish dishes. We had the Lambs brain and Rabbit. Both were delicious! Definitely recommended if you are ever in town!",
