    "Real talk: my favorite meal in Barcelona.After you walk in, you're greeted with a cooler of raw seafood beautifully displayed on crushed ice. You basically point at anything from lobsters to whole calamari, shrimp and oysters, they weigh it, you pay, they cook, you wait, you drink wine, they call you, you eat and eat and eat. So much food. So fresh. Go good.My favorite were the razor clams and the cold shrimp.",
