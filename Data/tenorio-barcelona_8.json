    "Nice appetizzers, had a beautiful escalivada catalana with a superb grated goat cheese topping. But the daily specials were somewhat not well put together. Grilled rabbit and potatoes and tomato sides were disapointing, even more as it was the house 'recomentat' dish. Excellent espresso and a fair wine list. Would recommend if, like me, you think Casa Batllo is too full and you need a place to hang out as the crowd disperses. As a destination? Seguro no, hombre.",
