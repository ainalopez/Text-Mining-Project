    "Nice and cozy place, make sure you book as it gets crowded in the evenings and its seems all tourists come at the same time when kitchen opens at 7pm. Food is prepared at open kitchen and all fresh. Great service and fantastic food. Aubergine Cake or Aubergine Millefeullie are my favourites , but there is a nice choice of pastas and risotto. It's definatately best and most intimate of all of Teresa's restaurants",
