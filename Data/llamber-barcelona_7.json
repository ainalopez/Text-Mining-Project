    "Short version: food, drinks, and service were all exceptional. Convenient location and menu available in multiple languages. Thoughtful presentation, good textures, and well-timed delivery of the components of the meal. I would give six stars if I could. The whole story: We ate here last night after reading the reviews. We didn't have a reservation and were seated at the bar - which turned out to be an excellent treat, as the bartender (Jos\u00e9) was fantastic. We got the artisan bread basket (served warm, crispy outside and soft inside), cod fritters (out of this world, perfect texture and great taste), beef carpaccio (great taste, good pairing with the bread too), and charcuterie (fine, nothing special). I had a cocktail with pimms and gin, strawberry and cucumber. I believe this was a Jos\u00e9 original and it was subtly sweet, with only a hint of the taste of alcohol (but you certainly feel it when you're done!).For the main course we had angus beef and veal. Veal was served with potatoes, carmelized onions, and a sweet/savory sauce. This dish was beyond reproach. The Angus beef was fine but far outshined by the veal. Both went well with a red bottle of wine recommended by Jos\u00e9.For dessert we had the passion for chocolate and the Catalan cream. \u00a0I LOVED the Catalan cream in both taste and presentation. My husband preferred the passion for chocolate, which had a nice smokey finish that went well with the whiskey/port cocktail that Jos\u00e9 created. We are only in Barcelona for a week and had never intended to see anything twice, yet we may have to circle back to this place again, at least for a cocktail and dessert.",
