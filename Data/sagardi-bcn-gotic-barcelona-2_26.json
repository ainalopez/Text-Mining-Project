    "This is in a cute little square that we keep walking through in and around el born/la ribera. \u00a0We had eaten at Taller de Tapas earlier (good) and then a day later stopped at Sagardi to snack on pintxos between Palau de la Musica Catalana and dinner. \u00a0We had a blast. \u00a0The cava was amazing, and we enjoyed the pintxos (although I'm finding that there is not a ton of variety - everything is some variant of cod fish, crab meat, or cheese). \u00a0We had an amazing asparagus/mushroom tart, a crab meat croissant, a baked pepper with codfish, and various cheese options. \u00a0It wasn't too crowded at 9 so we were able to easily get to the bar, and it was a slightly more mature crowd than Euskal Etxea",
