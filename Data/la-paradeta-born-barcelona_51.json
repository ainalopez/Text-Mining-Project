    "wow! \u00a0i am so glad we found this place!!! \u00a0A security guard from Sagrada Familia told us about this place and even though we had a hard time finding it (since he didn't speak fluent english), we didn't give up and was rewarded with the fresh and yummy seafood at this place!!!each seafood you order, you have an option of either grilling or frying it. \u00a0we had calamari (grilled), little lobster (grilled), some small squid (fried), and some steamed shrimp (so sweet!). \u00a0the dishes were so good that we went back to order a second round of seafood!!! \u00a0I wish we have a store like that in the states! \u00a0SO GOOD!!! a must stop in Barcelona!!! i wish we had more time in Barcelona so we could go back to this place again before we left!",
