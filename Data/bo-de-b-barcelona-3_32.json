    "Went here after reading positive yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Was craving a local sandwich for our last day in Barcelona on vacation from the U.S., and this little dive hit the mark with its fresh vegs, tasty bread and inexpensive prices. You pay slightly more than a Subway sandwich with about 3 times the taste and a bigger sandwich. I got the tuna (was really good) and my wife got chicken (even better). Only two things to be aware of: Be prepared to wait in line a little while to order as the place is small and takes time to get your food; don't expect to eat inside since it only has 3 tables.",
