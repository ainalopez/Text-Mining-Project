    "I used Yelp to find a place to eat while walking around the neighborhood. The reviews were excellent so we venture in and checked it out. The food was excellent, the service superb (especially for Europe) and the prices are lower than expected. It sends like a locals hang out so that'll tell you how good it really is! Downside... The restroom was miniscule! Haha",
