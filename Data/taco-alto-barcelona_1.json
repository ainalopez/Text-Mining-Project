    "Delicious tacos in a great atmosphere! Clean, modern, and colorful space with nice employees who speak English. The margaritas rimmed with salt are great as well as the variety of homemade salsas. As for the tacos, yum! They have interesting combinations of ingredients all with good flavor and for around 2\u20ac each. Great place to stop when around Ciudtadella and Arc de Triumph.",
