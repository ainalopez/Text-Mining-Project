    "My boyfriend and I went to here on our last night in Barcelona and this place was wonderful. We had such great service by a woman who seems like the owner but I can't be sure. Everything was delicious, and it was suggested by a local, so the crowd was a good mix of people. Definitely one of my favorite places we went in Barcelona for dinner.",
