    "Beautiful restaurant with rustic feel. \u00a0Wait staff was great. \u00a0Food was delicious with beautiful presentation. \u00a0Not strictly Spanish cuisine with some Italian/French influence. \u00a0Especially noteworthy was a potato/cheese/ham dish, the lamb, and salmon and cod tartar dishes. \u00a0Highly recommended if a bit hard to find.",
