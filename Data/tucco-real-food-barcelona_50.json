    "First time in Barcelona - visiting with friends. We had a few \"misses\" at other places in the city and also wanted something other than tapas. It was also a cold night so we wanted something warm...and delicious! This place came recommended from a friend and had great Yelp and TA reviews...which is well deserved!The gentleman working was so friendly and walked us though the menu, gave recommendations and answered all our questions! Everything (except the veggie burger patty) is made from scratch daily, yum! We landed on the lasagna and two kinds of ravioli. You get to also choose your own pasta sauce from a nice selection...the ricotta with pesto was AMAZING! The meal comes with a drink and dessert. The dessert was average but I cannot say enough about the homemade pasta - wonderful! Great price, fabulous food, and lovely service! Will go again before the trip is done!",
