    "I came here this past September with a friend when we were on vacation in Barcelona. \u00a0This place is very popular amongst tourists, so it was very crowded-- we arrived relatively early around 8pm on a Tuesday and had around a 40 minute wait. We started off with a pitcher of the red sangria. \u00a0It was a little sweet (although that's to your own preference), but very affordable (only around 15 euros for a pitcher) and strong enough to give us a sufficient buzz for the night. \u00a0For our meal, my friend and I split the pork loin flauta, the small squid, and the patatas bravas. \u00a0The patatas bravas were hot and crispy that was nicely complemented with a cool aioli sauce. \u00a0The squid and pork loin sandwich were also delicious, though not particularly spectacular.What stole the night for us, however, was the lobster paella that they served (perhaps a Tuesday special). \u00a0Midway through our meal, our server approached us and offered us some lobster paella from the fresh batch they had just made. \u00a0Despite being already full, we accepted the offer, which was possibly the best decision we made our whole trip because the lobster paella was to die for. \u00a0Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked lobster... even though I was there 5 months ago, I still fantasize about that lobster paella, and no paella has stood up to that one since. \u00a0Will definitely come back if (when) I am in Barcelona again.",
