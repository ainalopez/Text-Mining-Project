    "Amazing pizza! \u00a0Stopped in here for a couple medium sized slices which came out around 8 Euro. \u00a0The jamon y queso had little chunks of pork coated in some kind of tangy vinegar pepper sauce. \u00a0The other slice was something like buffalo mozzarella (super soft and fresh) with jamon and arugula. \u00a0It was damn good. \u00a0Pizza on foccaccia style bread is not something I'm used to (in the Boston area) but no complaints whatsoever. \u00a0One of the best and cheapest meals we've had in Barcelona so far. \u00a0I want to go back and try the slices which were LOADED up with jamon y brie.",
