    "Came here on a Friday afternoon with a friend to do some studying.Drink: My friend got cafe con leche and I got the infusion manzana turca. The tea was lighter than I expected but good. If I had stayed longer, I would have asked about getting more hot water. They do have an English menu.Ambiance: Very cozy and cute and clean. The back patio is a sweet spot to chat with friends and enjoy a coffee and dessert. There is shade but only for a few tables. Not sure where this would go under, but WiFi was a tad slow, so I wouldn't recommend coming here to get work done using the internet.Service: We received the menus promptly after getting situated, got our orders taken about 15 minutes after. Drinks came out in a timely manner. We asked for our check and waited about 15 to 20 minutes. After the server came out to the patio to serve other tables, we thought he had forgotten and he had. He seemed apologetic and we decided to pay at the counter so we could get going.All in all, I will be back because the food just seems too good to pass up. But I hope there will be less peering through the window to see if our server is coming and waiting idly for our check.",
