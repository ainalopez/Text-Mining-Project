    "Some of the best food. Ever. For the money, I can't think of what would beat it. Had the opportunity to eat here twice; incredible quality and comfortable, chill service were very consistent. The menu is a little strange as it seems pretty \"global\" for a tapas place, but nothing either of us ordered either night was out of place. 6-7 dishes + a bottle of wine is less than 60 \u20ac, for sure. Easy to find and approachable, a true gem of la Raval.",
