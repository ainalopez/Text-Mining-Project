    "I didn't intend on visiting an English pub while in Spain. But, It was the only place near my hotel showing the USA World Cup Soccer match.. The d\u00e9cor is fitting of an English Pub. But, the food was sub-par. The fish & chips was nothing to write home about, fish had no flavor & the batter was very greasy. The fries were decent. We also shared a burger, it was much better than the fish. I had a number of tap Guinness beers while watching the game, They were very good & priced fairly at 5 Euros each.Plenty of TV's showing the game, including a large projection screen in the back dining room. Great crowd for the game, must have been 75+ customers. The pub \u00a0is owned by an English couple, very nice & accommodating. Although, the daughter had a bit too much attitude for a waitress / bartender. A couple of other patrons confirmed the same negative attitude from the daughter.",
