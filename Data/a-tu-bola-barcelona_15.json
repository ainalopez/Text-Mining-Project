    "Tiny, very cool joint. It presents street cooking in a creative way. Their specialty is falafels and meatballs of all kinds. There is an open kitchen right in the center and you can watch chef Shira make her magic. Though I haven't yet tried everything there, sweet potato balls is something I dream about, and will always come back for. The consistency is soo perfect, with crunchy outside and amazingly velvety center. A perfect spot to take a break from tapas and try some original flavors.",
