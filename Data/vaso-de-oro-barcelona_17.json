    "One of my favorite places in Barcelona!!! It was my first time tonight, and my friends and I had a great time. Food is outstanding and freshly made. We were standing next the the flat iron grill, and we saw magic in the making. Beer was also great. The staff is very friendly. The place is tight, but very common in Barcelona, so we were ok. Steak with foie gras is a must!!!! Great ambience. I really considering going tomorrow again :)",
