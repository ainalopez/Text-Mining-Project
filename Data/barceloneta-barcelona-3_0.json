    "Beautiful views of the marina area of the Port of Barcelona. Upon entering the restaurant, there is a really unique Mediterranean vibe, the decor a bit quirky yet tasteful. We were greeted very promptly and the service was top notch.The food is exceptional and the menu extensive. This is a great place to come as a group so you can try the array of amazing tapas this restaurant has to offer. If you are looking for a place in this city that has the best seafood cooked authentically in the Catalan style, visit this place and you will not be disappointed. This was definitely a highlight during my visit to Barcelona.",
