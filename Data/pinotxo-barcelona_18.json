    "When my friends and I set foot in the Mercat de Boqueria, it felt like Christmas arrived for us. There was a glorious fare of meats, seafoods, tapas, fried things on sticks, cured meats on sticks, juices, pastries, spices, sweets...I could go on for days. Nonetheless, we chose Pinotxo for lunch and could not be happier with the simple but delicious tapas.We ordered clams, snails, rabbit, beef stew, fresh prawns, sole, anchovies and artichoke. The clams were steamed and drizzled with a bit of olive oil and salt. The taste was fresh and briny, almost as if they were taken from the water minutes ago. The snails were sauteed in some exotic spice/sauce we couldn't identify (similar to curry but not as strong) but so GOOD. My favorite dish was the steamed prawns because they were perfectly cooked and the meat was sweet--plus there was tons of roe on their bellies. :) The sauteed rabbit and beef stew were also richly-flavored, soft in texture and overall lip-smacking delicious.The guys who served us were extremely friendly and even joked around with us. I had a little crush on one of the chefs with the glasses--they were charming and lovely!",
