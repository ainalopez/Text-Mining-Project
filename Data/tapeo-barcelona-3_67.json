    "Stumbled upon this place after touring the Picasso Museum and getting stuck in an afternoon storm. More modernly devoted than a more crowded tapas bar across the street. Felt like we stumbled upon a secret the locals are in on while the tourists waited across the street. The skirt steak with chimichurri was our favorite but you cannot go wrong with the asparagus tempura or the potatoes with salmon and wasabi.",
