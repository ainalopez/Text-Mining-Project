    "Wonderful stop for a late breakfast in the pouring rain of Barcelona. Friendly service, delicious tortilla espa\u00f1ola with spinach, pan con tomate, real chamomile tea in a real bag and cafe con leche. The pan con tomate was made fresh in front of our eyes with the bread and beautiful tomatoes freshly sliced, olive oil drizzled and salted. \u00a0And it was delicious! \u00a0When we paid he informed us the pan con tomate was his treat. Does it get any better than that?!",
