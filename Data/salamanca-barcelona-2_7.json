    "We had yet another super late lunch and decided to try out Salamanca while wandering on the beach, partially since some other restaurants nearby were closed. Salamanca was packed with people in the heated tent outside. We figured it was probably a sign since so many chose it. We were also intent on hunting for paella, and Salamanca fit the bill on multiple fronts.We had grilled octopus as a starter and shared a seafood paella. The food was excellent, but we probably ordered a little too much for two people. The paella had a large size with generous amounts of succulent seafood, which I was thankful for, and we both felt completely stuffed towards the end of the meal. The only complaint I had was the lackluster sangria. Although luckily they let you order it by the glass (some places only do pitchers), it was very watered down due to the numerous large ice cubes in it. It also wasn't very well made and tasted rather bland.I would definitely come back for the paella and other seafood, and of course the view can't hurt (we didn't get to enjoy it this time even while dining outside since we were seated in a completely enclosed area with heaters).They give you complimentary cake after bringing your check. I can't remember what it was but we were seriously too full to eat it all. And supposedly as custom, we got charged for bread that we didn't order. The meal was really pleasant, and I guess the higher than average price tag is what you ought to expect considering the location.",
