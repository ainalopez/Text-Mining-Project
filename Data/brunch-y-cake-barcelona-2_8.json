    "Brunch & Cake is an extremely hyped breakfast joint and let me tell you why:I came here on two occasions during my time in Barcelona, but was disappointed both times.The first time, I ordered the acai smoothie bowl, which came out beautifully. It was served in hallowed pineapple, topped with kiwi, granola, strawberries, and slices of apple. It looked absolutely amazing and I couldn't wait to dive it--until I couldn't. The acai was incredibly icy, I felt I needed an ice pick instead of a spoon. I actually spent a good five minutes hacking into the acai ice sculpture before it was of an edible consistency. I was really disappointed because you can't really mess up a smoothie, but Brunch & Cake seemed to aim at proving me wrong.I left the restaurant thinking that perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, and I would give them a second chance another day. That day comes and I ordered the Ricotta Toast, which was described to be toast topped with maple syrup, ricotta, pistachios, and figs. And again, the presentation of the food at this establishment is incredible--simply gorgeous food. But once I took a bite in the toast, it was extremely dry--Grand Canyon dry. I figured the maple syrup would bring out the ricotta and balance the flavors, but I found the texture to be really unpleasant. I left, once again, disappointed.The best part of Brunch & Cake, personally, was the orange juice. It was freshly squeezed and by far the most refreshing drink I've had in a long while; but alas, this place is called Brunch & Cake, not Juice & Cake. Perhaps it was my food choices, but seeing as their menu wasn't that extensive to begin with, all their items should be hits--not just one or two.",
