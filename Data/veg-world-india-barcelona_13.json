    "What a great experience that was! It was our first time in this restaurant and \u00a0also our first time in a vegetarian place. It did not disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious and well priced. The restaurant is small and cozy. Service was outstanding. I could not ask for more. We'll be back!",
