    "Wow wow wow what an experience we had at Tickets.If you managed to get thru their complicated reservation system and pass the velvet ropes you are treated to an really amazing dining experience. \u00a0Tickets was #1 on our restaurant list when we were planning our Barcelona trip. \u00a0I won't get into that process because the system pretty much failed us and I was almost going to give up, but luck prevailed and I managed to score 2 reservations on two different days. \u00a0We came twice during our week stay in Barcelona because it was that good. \u00a0Make sure you have your reservation secured 60 days in advance to the day of your visit, or show up before it opens as I witnessed them letting a few people in with no reservations in this way. \u00a0If luck is not in your favor, Bodega 1900 across the street by the same people was amazing as well.We basically let our waiter order for us. \u00a0The menu is quite confusing and there are some dishes that we had that were not even on the menu. \u00a0It ended up being a 20 plus course meal \u00a0over 3 hours and it was out of this world. \u00a0Everything dish we tried was amazing. \u00a0The presentation and execution was something I have never seen. \u00a0 Everything was a surprise, dish after dish. \u00a0They definitely like their seafood here. \u00a0I tried their steak on the 2nd visit and it was amazing. \u00a0I came back the 2nd time specifically for that after seeing it served to another table on the 1st visit. \u00a0 Dessert was amazing as well. \u00a0I rather not go into everything dish by dish, since everything served was seasonal and I visited back in May. \u00a0I posted pictures so you can see how everything turned out. \u00a0Service is the best in Barcelona. \u00a0If you have been to Barcelona, you will understand that service is lacking in most places. \u00a0It is pricey and things add up really quickly. \u00a0If you are a big eater, don't expect to get too full since its all tapas and bites are pretty small.",
