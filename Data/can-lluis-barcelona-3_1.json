    "What a little gem, this place is so thick with history.... 3 generation in... We were denied at Cera 23.... And found this pretty place instead.... Sangria was just right, the olive was fresh, ordered grilled veggies and it's cooked perfectly, black rice paella was a hit, the baked typical pasta packed so much flavor it's not typical at all.... The steak we ordered was perfectly cooked with so much may juice we used the bread to absorb it.... The place was bombed as part of the history and the waiter are super friendly even we are Spanish challenged.... Next time when I'm I'm Barcelona I'm def coming back.... Highly recommended... They do have a second place up on the main street",
