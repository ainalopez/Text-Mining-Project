    "I was tired of bread and fried food I'd been eating while out travelling with my parents in Barcelona so I decided to grab a nice Wok take-away. This hit the spot. The veggies were fresh and cooked only to warm so they still had some crispiness and vitamins left in them. It was really busy and rather cramped... I would definitely Walk with it, and it took a little too long for them to get my food out (if they want to be a fast food place), but I would still highly recommend and I'd go back again.",
