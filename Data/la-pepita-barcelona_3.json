    "Today, I fell in love. Her name is La Pepita.I stopped into La Pepita during their lunch hours and had their menu del dia. The menu is an excellent deal- soup, salad, a thin sandwich (pepita), and dessert or coffee for 13 euros. I'll not say much about the soup or salad- they were both nice, but just basic appetisers. No complaints-- everything was very fresh and pleasant. I ordered the seared tuna pepita, which is served with rocket on a flaky, crisp bread bottom and topped with what seemed to be pickled daikon and sesame. There was an avocado sauce on the side. The tuna pepita was out of the world. The flavours in that dish were perfection. The textures were out of this world- everything was perfect. Well-- not everything. They did cook my tuna a wee bit more than I'd asked, and the avocado sauce was a tad too salty, but honestly, I didn't even care. It was all so tasty! The flavours were so addictive! I wanted another immediately. Instead, I had dessert. Dessert was sweet plantain topped with a dulce de leche sauce and some sort of nutty crisp balls as a garnish. It was tiny, but surprisingly filling. I think it was actually the perfect end to my meal.I left satisfied, curious about the gin tonics the people next to me were gleefully drinking. I definitely plan on coming back.4.5 stars for the small errors with the food-- but definitely closer to a 5 than a 4. I want more peptias!",
