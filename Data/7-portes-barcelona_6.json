    "So I did read the negative reviews before coming, but I still had hope! I mean all the restaurant guides did say that this long-standing institution is worth a visit, or perhaps I just missed the best things they had to offer? All I can say from my lunch rendezvous here is that the location is really good, and the decor is nice. Besides that, the restaurant itself is in many ways a tourist trap... and you know that because their menu comes in 7 languages lol. As a vegetarian, I suppose I could not have their specialties which were mostly seafood. But still, the salad and bread were a little tragic at best. I wouldn't say 1 star, because the staff was decent and accommodating.",
