    "Nice option in the gothic nabe. With a menu boasting crepes, burgers, sandwiches and other tasty bits it will be hard to decide. Both of my friends had the crepes and they seemed okay. I had the burger and it wasn't bad. They have lots of vegetarian and vegan options. Staff was nice. Great people and dog watching in the plaza if you sit outside.",
