    "There are no words to express how much I love love love this place. \u00a0It was one of the most memorable experiences I had in Barca. \u00a0Our first day in Barcelona and we hit up La Boqueria and managed to find El Quim. \u00a0Two of my friends and I were scrambling to get a seat, since it's purely bar tapas seating. \u00a0We find two, and I manage to stand. \u00a0El Quim himself grabs a chair from inside and brings it out for me. \u00a0We order the potatoes (I've honestly never had anything like this, AMAZING), artichokes, shrimp, to start with. \u00a0All of a sudden, Quim starts brining out other dishes to try such as their catalan style bread, octopus, mojito sorbet, and a glass of champagne for each of us. \u00a0Again, no words. \u00a0The food was amazing, pure, and delightful. \u00a0The service and atmosphere made this even more memorable.",
