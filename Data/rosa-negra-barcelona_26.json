    "Fantastic food, prices, and service!!! Mojitos and margaritas are only \u20ac3.50 and a huge and delicious chicken salad was \u20ac6.50. Every single taco that they had was delicious. Had to go again the next day! The only thing that upset me was their take-away smoothie. I ordered a pi\u00f1a colada that was \u20ac4 and it came in a tiny little plastic cup! Probably only like 4 or 5 oz",
