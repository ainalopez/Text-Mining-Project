    "Selected from our beloved Le Cool: Barcelona book, Kaiku was a great find and the best restaurant we visited during our stay in Barcelona.. Be sure to book in advance as this restaurant was already booked out by the time we arrived. Lucky for us, we were there before they were open for trading and the waiter was happy to squeeze us in. Right along the beach overlooking the W Hotel, the uninterrupted view of the ocean was another bonus to the incredible gastronomical creations on offer. Our friendly waiter suggested we try the crayfish in oyster leaf, which he insisted tasted just like an oyster. We were baffled yet extremely impressed. Any connoisseurs planning a trip to Barcelona must put Kaiku on their to-do list. I can't wait to go back again",
