    "PROS Awesome staff, delicious food, CONS A wee bit small, but so is every other place!Amaya's is a hidden jewel in las Ramblas. If you know anything about Las Ramblas, you would know that all food near this area is crappy overrpiced food for tourists, but this place is the exception. Yes it is a bit pricey (14 euros for Paella) but it is for a reason. They use fresh ingridients! Most of the Paella in other places is frozen and it is a add water solution, here they make it from scratch you can taste it! They also have their house Sangria which is awesome you need to try it! You can skip the Caprese salad, nothing special but the Ensalada con todo was delicious! I realized when we were done dining that they had the option to eat outside but the inside is actually nice as well, they have many awards they have won displayed and it is pleasant and a step up from street dining.",
