    "A really fantastic tapas joint. The prices vary wildly depending on which tapas you order, but at lunch with friends my partner and I spent 35 euros with a glass of Cava each.Since it's a large menu, here's some order highlights:Aubergines with honey and lime (5 euros)- Fantastic, large portion.Bombeta de la Barceloneta (2 euros)- Delicious, and my favorite overall. But it's 2 euros for just one!Tomato with buffalo burrata (9 euros)- Stunningly good, but expensive.Free-range chicken legs with soya and ginger (8 euros)- Super tasty, good portion size.Ib\u00e9rico pork ribs with honey and mustard (8 euros)- Yum yum yum (also, yum)Pro Tip: There's a small dining area in the back where a group can hang out and chat without having to sit at the bar in the front.",
