    "This place doesn't even deserve a star!I can't understand why this place has 4.5 stars on Yelp. Service is so scrambled and unorganized. Food and presentation is below average and it was very pricey. Maillet Chautagne: taste like apple juice with alka seltzer and soda water. This is their sparkling cava? Horrible! $5.5\u20acP Crues vino tinto: this is their best red wine by the glass and it taste like vinegar! $5.9\u20acEscoda wine 2007: good for its vintage $24.60\u20acBurratta Huerta: I could've bought this back home at whole foods market. It's just burratta and tomatoes seasoned with salt. $10.50\u20acEmperador Ahumado: Thinly sliced salted \u00a0fish with pomegranate and grapefruit. It was not satisfying. $16\u20acZamburinas: 6 itsy bitsy scallops the size of the nail bed of my thumb. Salty and sandy! $8.50\u20acCogollos: grilled romaine lettuce... Tasty? Nope! You should pass on this. $5.50\u20acAnd of course, Pan. 6 slices of baguette $2\u20acOverall experience, we left hungry and upset. The following day I had a big rash on my arm! Definitely got it after eating there! Never coming back again!",
