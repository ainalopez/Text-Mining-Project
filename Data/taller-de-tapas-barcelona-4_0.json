    "Great little place near Pl. Catalunya. \u00a0Took a chance on Taller on a Friday afternoon when city was hopping. \u00a0All the standards, jamon, queso, bravas, \u00a0pan tomato were very good. \u00a0But 3 dishes stood out; the fried aubergine and hearts of artichokes and pimientos Padron were outstanding. \u00a0The aubergine was sliced thin as a euro coin, had a light batter, and was dressed with honey and lime. \u00a0The artichoke hearts were sliced even thinner and flash fried to perfection. \u00a0Price was in line with the quality.",
