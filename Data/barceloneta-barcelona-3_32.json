    "This place was recommended by the concierge desk at the Hotel Arts. \u00a0It was a Sunday night and many places were closed. Very cool restaurant decor. The entrance is very well decorated and gives the restaurant a trendy feel. \u00a0Once inside it opens up to a multi level restaurant with great views. We were greeted by our waiter and assistant who were both very well dressed. \u00a0Their specialities is seafood and a great appetizer was the \u00a0sea snails. Grilled turbot was top notch. \u00a0A cup of espresso to finish it off to complete a great dinner. \u00a0This place was a great find! \u00a0Thanks to the concierge at Hotel Arts for a great recommendation.",
