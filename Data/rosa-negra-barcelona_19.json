    "The food & service were mediocre at best. My main issue with this place is that they advertise $3.50 mojitos and frozen margaritas, but what they should really advertise is $3.50 for limes mint and soda water. I'm a bartender and I watched them pour their liquor and it's so sad how much rum they put in their mojitos, a splash in each. I thought I missed something the first time I watched him make it, but then I watched him make 3 at a time and the combined pour time barely even made 3 seconds. This is barcelona, anyone can buy a decent bottle of wine for under 3 euro so don't waste your time spending 3.50 on a splash of rum at best. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.",
