    "My family and I went for a late breakfast on a Tuesday morning and we were all very impressed. The waitress was very attentive and friendly, and she tried not to laugh while I practiced my Spanish with her. I got two fried eggs with tomatoes and avocado with hearty toast and a light salad. It was very delicious and paired wonderfully with the pot of herbal mint tea. I would recommend going earlier if you have a larger group because there aren't many places to sit together. Overall lovely experience!",
