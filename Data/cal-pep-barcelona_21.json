    "The experience was what gave this 3 stars- waiting in line, meeting people and talking more with them was a plus. \u00a0I sat at the bar on a Monday evening and the wait wasn't too bad. \u00a0After looking around, it seemed like everyone got the exact same menu - over-salted calamari, some very delicious clams and ok monkfish. \u00a0Nothing to write home about and certainly not worth the hype. \u00a0I am guessing/hoping the dining room will be more enjoyable.",
