    "This place is well known for brunch and dinner and we tried the dinner here. we ordered the chicken burger which had the perfectly tender grilled chicken and some great sauces. We also got the shiitake mushroom croquettes and the vegetable spring rolls which were just amazing. The croquettes were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and still somehow felt very lite. The spring roll was accompanied with an Asian salad and really good soy sauce. They also had an extensive cocktail menu, but mostly all the classic cocktails. For the three portions we got, we paid about 20 bucks which isn't bad at all! I would definitely recommend this place!",
