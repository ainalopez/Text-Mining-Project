    "Went for lunch with a few friends and had a great time. The place was full of locals and was pretty busy but managed to find some counter space after waiting about 5-10 minutes. Both the food and cava (we had the rose) taste great and are so cheap. 4 of us ate and drank our hearts out and the bill came out to less than 40 euros. They don't speak any English, but they're friendly so you should be able to get by if you can at least speak even a little bit of broken Spanish.",
