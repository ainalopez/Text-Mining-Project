    "Not going to lie, I was a little let down by Paco Meralgo. \u00a0Felt like the prices were a little egregious for the quality and portions, and it seemed like the restaurant's waiters were being pushed to the edge.The vibe of the whole place is one of controlled chaos - tables are stuck wherever possible, and wherever open space would be, there are people waiting for a table to open up. \u00a0The whole thing creates a bit of claustrophobia, at least until you have a few drinks - then it just seems bustling!Service seemed disjointed, as we had 3-4 different waiters swinging by and none seemed to communicate with the one another. \u00a0Additionally, one of the busboys dropped a platter of glasses (understandable given the crowds) and the nearby waiter RIPPED into him in front of the entire room full of customers.Overall, the food was pretty darn good - the cod \"sashimi\" with tomato was great, and the patatas bravas were as good as advertised - but a few were disappointing; for example, we got some scallops on the half-shell and they were comically tiny and over cooked (and at over 10 euros, it was even harder to swallow). \u00a0Best pa amb tomaquet we had as well, though we had to ask for it a handful of times.Given how many quality tapas places there are, we'd probably not return to Paco Meralgo. \u00a0If you end up there, you probably won't go home disappointed, but in my opinion not worth the hype.",
