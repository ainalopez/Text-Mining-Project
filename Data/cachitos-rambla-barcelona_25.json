    "\"What is that!? Mexican?\" ... was how the hotel clerk responded when we asked for directions to this place we'd heard was great called \"Cachitos\". \u00a0Pretty sure I didn't say it like I was Cheech'n'Chong.Luckily, Google Maps was able to help us out and we arrived at a quiet corner of the upper Ramblas. We were impressed with the style and ambiance of the main restaurant but since it was a pleasant June day, took a table under a tent on the Ramblas.It was a lovely, leisurely lunch. Great food, perfectly attentive staff, and great people watching. I wish I was sitting there right now, glass of cava in my hand.",
