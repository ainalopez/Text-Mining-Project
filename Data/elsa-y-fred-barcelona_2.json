    "We really enjoyed our visit to Elsa y Fred. We went there after I found it on Time Out Barcelona in an article about patatas bravas which I am obsessed with. I am very glad we did walk over there after El Xampanyet. We had the house cava which was nice and dry. Loved the pan con tomat (the bread with tomato) which was crisp and flavourful. The bravas are indeed very good and a bit different to most. The porcini (cep) croquettes were fun but full on! More info here mylifeinsin.com/2015/04/\u2026",
