    "This was my absolute favorite restaurant/bar that we ate at in Barcelona. Hands down one of the best meals I've had. The fiance and I were having a late dinner and thanks to yelp, found this awesome little place. The restaurant isnt huge and was totally packed when we arrived. We only waited a about 5-10 minutes for a table though, and that was great.Our waiter didn't speak a lick of English which we were totally OK with. That's half the fun, right? My Spanish isn't very good, but we made do. We ordered SOOO much food...probably too much food, but hey we're on vacation! The cuttlefish was the standout dish. Incredible. Get it.We were able to mime our way through ordering dessert off of a specials sign and it was great. Our waiter was so patient, funny, and nice. He laughed with us and we really had a great time. I will be back here.",
