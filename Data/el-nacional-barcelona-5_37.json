    "Please note: the following words are from the perspective an an American with extensive travel experience.This place is cool! Very neat concept nestled in the middle of busy Barcelona. Apparently, it used to be a garage/car repair shop and was converted in 2014 to become a swanky, upscale drink and food place. Great background music--we thought it was live but not sure. There were five or six little places on the edges that were for food and a few bars down the middle. Great ambiance and environment. \u00a0An awesome place to grab a cocktail while shopping. The server at our little stop was irritated that we wanted to order and then a little irritated that we wanted to pay but she was friendly(ish). I ordered an Old Fashioned that was made with orange and chocolate (apparently a Spanish thing) but, if you like that combo--as I do--it was superb!",
