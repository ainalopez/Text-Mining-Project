    "the Teresa Carles restaurant is just wonderful. after many days in Barcelona eating delicious Tapas but being limited in choice to 2 or 3 things on a menu-- it was delightful to walk into this beautiful space and have a wonderful breakfast. so wonderful we went back for lunch:). when we arrived at 430 they were just posting a closed sign in the window. when the lovely woman saw our crestfallen faces she immediately opened the door and told us to come in. we had a wonderful meal-- not rushed. all fresh wonderful veggies and tempeh and greens. 2 of our party had the carrot soup. everyone was sighing with happiness. imagine my delight to find gluten free bread as an option-- because yes-- I'm a gluten free vegetarian!! if our hotel wasn't so far --and I wasn't so full I'd be back for dinner!",
