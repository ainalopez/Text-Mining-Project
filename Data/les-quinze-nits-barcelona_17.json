    "This restaurant was one of the highlights in Bar\u00e7a!! We ended up finding it when we were walking plaza Reial. There was a huge line in front (must be good) and we went for it!!The location is great, the prices were incredibly reasonable (cheap!!!) service was fast and the food was simple but delicious!!! I had the chicken with cheese sauce and apple!! Great choice! We ordered water, a bottle of wine, bread, 2 main dishes and desert, and our bill came at $41 euros!!! Sure enough we went back!",
