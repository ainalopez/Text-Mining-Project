    "This is a favorite spot of many locals for relaxing on the patio with some beers & smokes. \u00a0It has a huge interior (read: away from the street) patio with a resident cat, weird plastic sculpture, and a giant fig tree in the center. \u00a0There's not much to eat, just a small selection of bocadillos, but one of them is vegan!Beware that if you don't like to smoke or be exposed to second-hand smoke, this is not the place for you.There are also community arts events on a regular basis; pick up a calendar while you're there.",
