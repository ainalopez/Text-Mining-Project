    "This is a very popular tapas bar especially around Spanish dinner time ~10:00pm when the lines will wrap around the corner in this basement tapas joint (no reservations can be made ahead). Tapas 24 is known for its inventive / gourmet take on old tapas faves and is run by Charles Abellan who used to work for Ferran Adri\u00e0 at El Bulli.All the items we ordered here was delicious:-The bikini which is a toasted crispy truffle Iberian ham and buffalo mozza sandwich. (SO GOOD!)-The bravas doused in a spicy tomato sauce and a thick garlic aioli was highly addictive and hard to resist-The spicy tripe stew cooked with chorizo and chickpeas. I love tripe and it is hard to find this delicacy in non-asian restaurants in New York. The tripe stew had a very comfort food feel to it.-The bombes de la Barceloneta is filled with creamy potato and minced beef and topped with aoili and bravas. Really interesting crispy texture and meaty and tender texture when you bite into it.-Lamb skewer: spicy and tender lamb pieces packed with flavor from the curry and mint marinate.We didn't have any room left but I would have loved to try the McFoie burger that I saw the other tables ordering.The only issue I had with this restaurant was the service - our waiter was rude and gave us a lot of attitude every time he came by.",
