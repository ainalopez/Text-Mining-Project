    "Who doesn't love Brunch & Cake? At first it just seemed like it was the cool place to be, so I checked it out. Now I'm there at least a few times a week because their food is just that good. Don't miss the eggs Benedict on a waffle! One thing that I don't love about it is that it's basically like being in the States. Don't be surprised to only hear other english speakers inside, and be surrounded by plenty of basic sorority girls studying abroad. But hey, at least the food makes up for it.Had to update my review and give them a full five stars! In my last few months in Barcelona I have been to Brunch and Cake countless times and have NEVER been disappointed. Every dish is delicious( I've tried pretty much all of them) and the staff, aside from one non-Spanish chick who likes to rush people, is absolutely wonderful! What I love about Brunch and Cake, aside from the yummy and creative food, is its versatility. It's a great place for a weekend brunch, but also lovely for a weeknight casual dinner. Better yet, go on a weeknight evening, have some tea and cake and people watch from the benches. Thank you Brunch and Cake for a great semester!",
