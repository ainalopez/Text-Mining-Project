    "Excellent tapas with very affordable price. We loved almost everything we ordered, grilled peppers, mini burgers, grilled asparagus and mushrooms, shrimp. The foie gras with bread was different and on the heavy side. We got there 10 mins after opening, the entire first floor was already packed. It certainly was a popular spot!",
