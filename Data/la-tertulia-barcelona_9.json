    "I really wish I had wi-fi to check in to this place while I was there this past week. \u00a0The food here is AMAZING!! \u00a0you won't go wrong with anything on their menu. \u00a0i highly recommend the deep fried camenbert cheese served with the raspberry sauce, house crouquettes, the meat \"bomb\", both mushroom dishes, and the jamon iberico tapas. \u00a0the best part is, its in the middle of a neighborhood, away from the hustle and bustle of tourists so you'll see lots of locals sitting around and enjoying their family time. \u00a0i happened to be there during a FCB match and it was AWESOME! \u00a0the restaurant was filled with groups of families cheering and watching the game. \u00a0this place was so good i went there twice during my trip and it was a 3 day trip.",
