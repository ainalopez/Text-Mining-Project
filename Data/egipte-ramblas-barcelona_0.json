    "As we were at La Rambla around late noon and realized that we actualy didnt have lunch yet, we decided to try out 'Egipte' as suggested by my Travel Book. We gave it a try since it was easy to find anyway :DThe Venue is quite small at least seen from the entrance, but homey. We walked in passing the Tapas Bar and some tiny tables and went up stairs. Its rustically furnished with old drawings (noticed some places in Germany!) matched to the age of the building itself.Now about the food! Overall I was satisfied with the dishes, nothing surprising except the taste n presentation of their desserts! Very flattering indeed. Too bad didnt manage to take a pretty shot. :sAs it isnt marked as a high end Resto (around 15 Bucks for a complete menu), we were more than happy to get the bill and leave this place with a bright smile to the english speaking waiter who was very helpfull and friendly.",
