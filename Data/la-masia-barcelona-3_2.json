    "We walked by this place and it was packed and had a sign celebrating their 60th anniversary as of 2012. \u00a0We figured it wouldn't disappoint but it did. \u00a0As we walked in the pinchos did not look as good as the previous place we went to.But we decided to have a few beers and sample but were really let down. Not sure why it's so busy- maybe bc it's a popular spot for the young college student crowd. \u00a0The food isn't good here.",
