    "This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.Here's the concept: Every food item is made tapas-style, so it's a single-serving. \u00a0Each little dish has a wooden dowel sticking out of it. \u00a0Go around, pick however many little dishes you want and then place the stick in the cup in the center of your table. \u00a0At the end of the meal, the waiter calculates how many sticks you've amassed throughout the meal and then charges you for what you've consumed.Oh my, the food was delicious! \u00a0Every dish was well made and offered a taste of many classic Spanish dishes so you could try \"real\" food (this is why we travel, right?). \u00a0Since there was so much going on, you could test your comfort level without going too crazy. \u00a0You can stick to the familiar or try something totally insane (octopus, anyone?) and if you really don't like it, share it with someone at your table or go grab something else.Beer was cheap but the Pepsi expensive, so think about that when you're ordering. \u00a0I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Barcelona. \u00a0You should go, too.",
