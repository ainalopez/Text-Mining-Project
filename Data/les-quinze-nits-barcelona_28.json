    "Good food, good location, good price.We had tapas and the paella. The patatas bravas was good and generously portioned, but not the best I've had. Don't get the nachos, guacamole did not seem fresh. The paella was hot and steamy and delicious. it's a minimum two person order, so eat with a friend! Lots of seafood and completely satisfying. Extremely good for the price! Besides this, there's lots of variety on the menu, all fairly priced.Great location in the Plaza Reial. There's outdoor seating with heat lamps so you can enjoy the pretty palm trees in the square.My only gripe: the service. When we went, it was around 4PM so the restaurant was pretty dead, yet everything was still really slow. Took long to order our food. Understandably though, paella takes 20-30 minutes to make usually, so keep this in mind.Get the sangria pitcher!",
