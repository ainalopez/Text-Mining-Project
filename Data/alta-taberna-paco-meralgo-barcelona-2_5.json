    "Amazing seafood are aplenty in Barcelona. \u00a0We were on a mission to find the best and ATPM came highly recommended by a local. \u00a0We came early for dinner without reservations and were seated at the bar. \u00a0Spacious restaurant with a modern flair. \u00a0Friendly staff. \u00a0We tried the following tapas:-Bacalao- codfish drenched in olive oil, topped with tomatoes, and olives. \u00a0Fresh seafood that just melts in your mouth.-Fried oyster- \u00a0sweet, delicate, creamy-Anchovies- drenched in olive oil with some lemon zest, simply delicious and not too salty. \u00a0They were perfect with the house (tomato) bread. -Langostinos hervidos- \u00a0grilled sweet, succulent prawns -The dessert was an almond sponge cake soaked in a creamy rum brothWell worth the price given the premium quality of the seafood. \u00a0ATPM is also a supporter of the Slow Food movement in the EU. \u00a04.5 stars.",
