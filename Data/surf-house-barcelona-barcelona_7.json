    "Blown away with the food!!! See all the pictures I took that what we had. Must have the nachos! So delicious. \u00a0Layer of layers of layers of cheese.... so delicious!! The salad tasted very clean and healthy, the foccacia with mushroom is excellent. Even the ice tea taste so fresh and yeah I have to admit their overall food and drink are well presented. \u00a0Anyway, you must try if you are here in barcelona. Highly recommend.",
