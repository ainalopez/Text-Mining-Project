    "Wow what a fancy place! \u00a0Wifey and I made reservations for this place and was anticipating it to be expensive. Boy was it expensive. But don't get me wrong it's definitely worth the $$$$. The food the chef made was good. Love the fact that he used Catalan signature items to infuse with the food. \u00a0Gave me a really good taste of what Catalan people's palettes are, sweet )even the fois gra was sweet. The pairing of the wine also was a treat. Who would have thought of a rose(wine) tasting like bacon. It's definitely something to try if you have the $$$$ for it. Cost me and the wifey over $325 (US dollars) but hey, YOLO(in Barcelona-haha)",
