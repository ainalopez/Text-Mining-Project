    "Delicious, to-die-for quiche. Excellent carrot cake. Four stars because the service is, like most locally-owned restaurants, contingent on who happens to be working while you're there. My most recent experience was the one that gave me bad vibes.There was only one other customer I handed a \u20ac20 bill for a cappuccino & a quiche (\u20ac7,20) and was given \u20ac2,70 (three \u20ac,20 cent coins & one \u20ac,10, which can easily be mistake as the proper change i was owed of \u20ac,80, but I intuitively question her honesty based on weird vibes). When I asked for the remainder of my change, she looked disappointed but returned to the cash register, and gave me a \u20ac10 bill. But, the quiche was probably worth \u20ac20 anyway, so... I'm obviously going back.",
