    "I've been coming to Barcelona for years and this is absolutely my favourite bar! The tapas are great and the Craft Beer is excellent. But the real reason I keep coming back is the service! The staff are very friendly, chatty, helpful and fun! I feel I should give a big shout out to Aron, Kater\u00edna and Lidia! I really don't think they could of been nicer. This bar gets the \"Martin Kennedy Two Thumbs Up Award\"",
