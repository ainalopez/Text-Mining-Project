    "Their Bombas are the bomb! \u00a0When we arrived, we were so hungry, that I ordered a second plate of bombas, but really, after the padron peppers and mussels, and caracoles (snails), the 2 of us were too stuffed for the second round of bombas. \u00a0Everything was excellent and flavorful. \u00a0A bit on the heavy side, because of the potato \"bombs\" - but they were so good. \u00a0Not diet food. \u00a0But still, very good food. \u00a0Service can be, how can I put this gently - gruff? \u00a0But in a somewhat playful way... I guess it depends on who you get. \u00a0Prices are reasonable, considering the quantity.",
