    "If I lived in Barcelona, I would eat here often. The food was fresh and creative. The creative mix of ingredients resulted in a wonderful dining experience. The food was so good that we ended up ordering an encore of main courses. The tour guide books that we read said not to eat near La Rambla; however, they are clearly wrong when it comes to this restaurant.",
