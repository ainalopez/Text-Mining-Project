    "Loud, vibrant, inviting establishment with great late-night snacks. Most, if not all, of the tapas I had were satisfactory to great, and all at a pretty decent price. The highlights for me were all things calamari and, more importantly, the breaded camembert with raspberry sauce -- oof!!! That and some Estrella? A guaranteed good time.On the downside, the place does get quite packed, and the staff, bless their hearts, can barely keep up. So order a bunch of tapas and drinks to last you for a while.",
