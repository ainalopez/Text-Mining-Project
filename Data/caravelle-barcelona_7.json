    "Barcelona can be strange culinarily speaking because it's a city obsessed with tapas. So, I was very happy to be introduced to Caravelle from an expat I met. The interior looks to be more coffee shop than restaurant, but starting at 7pm their kitchen opens. I ordered the roasted chicken with Israeli salad and a creamy lemon sauce. For a side I got the bulgur wheat salad with grapes and goat cheese. Both were very tasty. Dessert was \"banana split\" which was more of a banana fosters with salted caramel, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream. I would like to thank Caravelle for daring to be different in a city that is drowning in sad tired tapas establishments.",
