    "Way expensive for the quality and service you get here. I did come here a couple years ago and portions where well served; tonight we came with a group of 9 to enjoy some good pasta. Total disappointment (we are actually from Barcelona); the caprese salad was worse than the one you could make at your house; the Porta a Porta salad....omg it's like the one I get at some cheap lunch menu...had absolutely no fun in it, was wattery. Now the pastas...huge plate (literally)...only 1/3 of it was pasta. Pisses me off to leave a restaurant being overpriced, but specially when I leave hungry!!!And the service...well if Spain in general is laid back, im telling you i was furious about them not bringing anything we asked for.",
