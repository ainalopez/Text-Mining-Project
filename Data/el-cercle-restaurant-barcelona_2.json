    "This place was just around the corner from our hotel. The 2nd floor terrace was the drawing point for us as it was a great view and cooler breeze. We sat watching the plaza below and had a great dinner. You can see some of the food posted. All were great and would go here again on future visits. The bar area outside looks very good and romantic setting.",
