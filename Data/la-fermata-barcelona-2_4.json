    "This is a great spot for a quick lunch. My favorites: \u00a0potato+pesto and ham+arugula+mozzarella. All of the pizza slices we tried were delicious, just not warm enough... Which is why I only gave 4 stars. It was also a little more pricey than what you would expect for just a few slices of pizza.",
