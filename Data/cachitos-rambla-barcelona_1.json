    "Although I had read all the mixed reviews on Yelp, we decided to give this restaurant a shot on a Sunday night. We got seated right away, on the second floor of this three story restaurant. It had a weird, almost confusing atmosphere. There were velvety, red couches and chairs on the second level. The music was different- it played 50 cent, Neyo, and Spanish music. We were a bit confused.. Were we at a club or a restaurant???We got the seafood paella and two oyster tapas. Turn offs:1. Over priced food. One oyster cost us 3.50 euros?! The seafood paella was 18.50 per person. 2. Paella was too salty!!! It had an ugly brown tinged color, not the bright orange saffron color I was expecting. 3. \"Seafood\" paella came with TWO clams, and four large shrimps. That was very disappointing as when I think of seafood, I don't think of only two clams. There were chopped up pieces of octopus and maybeeeeee a 3 or 4 pieces of fish- which didn't compensate for anything... Sprinkle the rice with some Tabasco, this kind of levels off the saltiness of the dish. 4. Raw oysters didn't come with any lemon, we asked for Tabasco to block off any fishy taste. Overall, restaurant was descent, but not worth the money I think. Too expensive for mediocre paella and basic oysters.",
