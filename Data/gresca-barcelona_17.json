    "The reviews convinced us that Gresca was worth a short cab ride for our last night in Spain. \u00a0We arrived a bit early for our 8:30 reservation, finding that the restaurant wasn't officially open yet, although they let my wife and her broken foot sit in the lobby for a few minutes. \u00a0Spain is quite a contrast to home, where all the local restaurants close at 9 pm.We were the first to be seated, and our two servers were outstanding, recommending a nice wine, and helping us with the menu. \u00a0The chef made a modification to one of our dishes to satisfy a dietary constraint, which was a nice accommodation. \u00a0Appetizer was ham and shaved artichoke salad, along with a complimentary appetizer of cod with shaved almonds (how they do the almonds is beyond me). \u00a0Entrees were scallops for my wife, and veal tongue with sage for me (in honor of my late father). \u00a0The food, presentation and staff were all outstanding, and made our last evening in Barcelona a memorable one.",
