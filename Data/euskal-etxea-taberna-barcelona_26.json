    "I loved this spot. It was packed, you grab a spot anywhere you can at the standing room only bar (there might have been a few tables, actually), and grab yourself some pintxos. \u00a0Then, when you're done, they count up your sticks and charge you for what you ate. I found it to be really inexpensive. And, while most of it was seafood based, we had a couple of lovely ones...some kind of cheese with I think quince, tortilla, some other stuff that to be honest, I totally don't remember. \u00a0Anyhow, I liked the idea, I liked the atmosphere, I liked the close proximity to our pad, and I liked the guy that brought us the drinks, Leo. Apparently, it's a pretty authentic Basque place in Barcelona, but that's something I don't know to much about. I would absolutely come back.",
