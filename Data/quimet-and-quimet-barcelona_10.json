    "Best tapas we had in our stay in Barcelona. As everyone mentioned, there are no seats. Expect to be assertive when ordering, and try to hack together some Spanish and the staff will appreciate it. This was probably the only place we went to that felt like we were getting tapas like they were meant to be. Don't miss it!",
