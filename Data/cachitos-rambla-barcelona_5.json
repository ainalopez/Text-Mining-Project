    "My favorite dish I had in Barcelona was at this restaurant. Get the zucchini tagliatelle with cuttlefish and shrimp. It is all zucchini (no pasta) and is incredibly tasty. Only complaint is that the shrimp were not cleaned so that I don't have to eat their poop. When we told the waiter, he said that's how they eat shrimp in Spain, with poop and all. Those Spaniards are round around the edges!You also have to get the cava sangria. We came here 3 nights out of the 7 nights we were in Barcelona. (So my family is a bit obsessive). The decor is beautiful and really enjoyed my experience is here.",
