    "Amazing restaurant - delicious food - friendly people (who kindly assisted with a surprise cake for the birthday girl in our group), what else could you ask for? Visited this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation and I have to admit he was not wrong! The food was delicious, the ambiance cosy and I loved the 'little' maze and numerous nooks and crannies. The cocktails were innovative and refreshing. I can't fault it anything to be honest! Most definitely worth visiting - especially if you are looking for something that doesn't scream touristy and has a local feel. I look forward to going back!",
