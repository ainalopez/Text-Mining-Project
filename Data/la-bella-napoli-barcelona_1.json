    "The secret of a good pizza is always on the dough, no doubt about it. It is easier to get good quality toppings than to make a decent dough, and after that you have to cook it properly. It's an art. This guys have it. It seems is not easy to mix flour, water and yeast, because I have seen so many epic fails in the pizza business, even I can remember one that cooked the fought with butter, seriously?. We started with some melted provolone, a must if you like cheese, and we had pizzas as main dishes. Mine was the pizza diavolo with spicy salami. It had the spiciness I am looking for in this kind of pizzas and it was perfectly cooked. My partner got the Sofia Loren pizza, with fresh bresaola. A really good combination indeed, done with finesse. Service was on the spot. Not to fast not too slow. Price was also right, it was what I expect to pay for a really well pizza. I am definitively coming back, maybe with a jersey, because I found the AC too cold for me.",
