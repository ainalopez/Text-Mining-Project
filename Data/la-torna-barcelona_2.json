    "I was wandering around the market at lunchtime and decided to drop in here for a bite to eat because the menu looked good and it was reasonably priced. \u00a0I sat at the bar and the service was very friendly. \u00a0I ordered the grilled clams for 7,50 and they were amazing! \u00a0She also brought a side of tomato bread which was great with the clams. I sat next to 2 couples from NYC who had eaten there the day before and came back because they loved it so much. \u00a0They had some \"items of the day\"--veal and a fish dish covered with onions and currants. He said the veal was amazing and she said the fish was just ok. \u00a0They have items on their hot bar where you can see them under the glass at the counter. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place especially for seafood since it is in the market!",
