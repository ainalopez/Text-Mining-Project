    "This was a great little find. I loved sitting at the bar and ordering from the display (much like a sushi bar). I was a little skeptical that a restaurant with a photo-by-photo menu of each item could impress... but I was wrong. The cold, dense cubes of tortilla (Spanish omelette) were my favorite the whole trip. You just can't beat an Estrella and an assortment of tapas this place offers.",
