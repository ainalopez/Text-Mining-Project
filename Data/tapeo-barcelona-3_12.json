    "While walking around the Gothic Area after visiting the Picasso Museum trying to find a great restaurant and avoid tourist traps Yelp lead me to Tapeo. I was most surprised by the quality of the food here along with the prices, a real value for such a quality product. With Sangria (which was pretty awesome), our bill was less than $50.Iberico Ham - Pretty standard but simultaneously delicious. The same prosciutto style ham that is found throughout the city.Iberico Pork Ribs - The tasty little riblets were fantastic. I really enjoyed the glaze on them.Beef Cheek - If you have tried short rib, beef cheek is very similar. In fact it may be hard to tell the difference for most. This was some fork tender beef that was slow cooked in a perfectly seasoned marinate.Catalan Cream - Catalan Cream is very similar to Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, they actually take a torch to theirs here making it even more like its toasted dessert cousin.",
