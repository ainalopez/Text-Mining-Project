    "This restaurant was recommended by a waiter @ another restaurant as having a good paella. We were a party of 13. I had read about the bread charge so it was cool when I saw all the bread on the table. They proceeded to put a couple plates of olives and Spanish ham we did not order so it must be comp right? \u00a0We ordered the special paella @ 36 euros and had asked for the seafood peeled (no shrimp heads please) which the waiter said no prob. We eat ... Paella meh it was tasty but the lack of seafood it was upsetting. The bill comes I start to look it over. We were charged 16 servings of bread when we were 13, minor error right ? Well we were charged a 40 euro \"marisco\" charge, 18 extra appetizer charge and 103 euros for the ham!I did not complain about the ham since we did eat but when I question the other items I was told oh sorry we will fix that (bogus charges). Upon leaving the waiter tells us btw service(tip) is not included. \u00a0That is all he had to say for me to turn around and say ... We r not leaving a tip because we were charged 100 euros for ham we did not order! The manager came over and tried to smooth things out. He gave us back the 100 euros and asked us to come back but the damage is done. We cannot recommend a place like this with its unethical behaviors. \u00a0Thankfully we speak Spanish \u00a0and were able to speak up and be heard but I can only imagine how many other tourists are tipsy after their free after dinner drink And get scammed left and right ! \u00a0STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!",
