    "The food (sausage and mushroom rice) was very good. The blackberry mojitos were just as good as everyone says, if not better. The service was somewhat lacking and frustrating (received two appetizers before even water or drinks 5 minutes later, timing on another entree almost seemed forgotten) even early in the evening, but overall would still recommend.",
