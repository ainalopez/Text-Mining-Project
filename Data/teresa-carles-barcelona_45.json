    "Delicious vegetarian food. I wanted to try everything on the menu. You can also make your own salad. You should definitely stop by. The service is great and everybody is very friendly. And the restaurant is appealing and comfortable. Try: spaghettini Tartuffe nero and mil hojas de berenjena.",
