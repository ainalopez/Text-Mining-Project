    "Veggie Garden conveniently opened in late 2011, just as I was starting an intensive masters degree. A healthy, affordable, vegan kitchen just steps away from my apartment? Clearly, I ended up here multiple time per week.This is a vegan Nepalese restaurant. The owner is a warm, super friendly man named Ramesh, who is an absolute gem and always waves to me even when I'm just passing by. His wife and young son are usually around to entertain as well. They have an extensive list of fresh juices and smoothes; my favorite is carrot, orange, and ginger. If you're in the mood for a treat the Canella Vanilla smoothie has pear, walnuts, cinnamon, vanilla... it's delicious but rich.The best value is the menu de dia, which includes a starter (usually a soup, salad, hummus, or momos, Nepalese dumplings) a main course (a Thali with 3 vegan curries, stuffed eggplant, polenta, for example), bread, water or wine, and a dessert for 8,25 EUR.My one complaint would be that the bread is usually on the stale side but the food is plentiful and the price is the best I've seen in Barcelona. Enjoy!",
