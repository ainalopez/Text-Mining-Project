    "What a find! My traveling companion spotted this whilst we were traipsing around the tiny sidestreets of El Raval; and perhaps more impressively, was able to find it again without the help of a GPS.This place has three major things going for it: ALL vegan, cheap, and very good portion sizes. Everything we had was quite tasty as well.They have a wide range of vegan tapas, salads, and some menu del dia type options too. \u00a0Ecologique (organic) wine and beer too.If I weren't so full I would have gone for a zumo del dia (juice of the day) which are freshly made and looked so good.Definitely a good option for lunch or dinner!",
