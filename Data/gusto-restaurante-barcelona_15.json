    "Would give it 3.5 if that was an option. \u00a0Worth a stop if you are craving Italian or Neopolitan pizza and in the area. \u00a0Don't go too far out of your way. \u00a0It was definitely good just nothing amazing and the pizza was a little runny and undercooked. We have not tried any other Italian while in Barcelona, so it may be one of the best. I am comparing it to quality Italian food I have had in other European cities.",
