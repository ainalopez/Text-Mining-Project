    "Cute spot with delicious breakfast.Husband and I walked by and check out the menu.We were draw by the organic eggs.On our last day we decided to try this place out and was throughly pleased.The menu had a good selection of healthy and traditional egg dishes.My traveler combo with poach eggs over salad and raspberry brie sandwich was perfect.Husband's salmon egg benedict was well made with a green salad mixed with walnut and raisin.Definitely worth checking out...!",
