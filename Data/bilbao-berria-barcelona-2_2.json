    "Cute pintxos bar. Right on the cathedral square so very crowded and touristy. Looking at past reviews, it seems the prices have been steadily climbing for the past few months- maybe in preparation for summer? Up to 1,85 per stick now. Great presentation, but you're basically paying for a tiny slice of bread and tuna salad or two bites of cake. Great if you don't have to wait or are willing to eat standing, but I'm sure there are better and less expensive pintxos to be had in Barcelona.",
