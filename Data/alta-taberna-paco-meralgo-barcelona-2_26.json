    "This place was recommended to me by native Catalan friends that live in BCN so I do not consider it a tourist trap as another reviewer claims. \u00a0I thought it was excellent especially considering some other tapas bars that I tried. \u00a0Everything came out piping hot, nicely seasoned and fresh. \u00a0Beef was better than most other places in BCN, whelks, razor clams, tomato bread, peppers, seared foie with sweet balsamic reduction, it was all good. Recommend reservations and be prepared to eat fast cuz they like to turn over the tables",
