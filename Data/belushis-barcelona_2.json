    "Been here multiple times throughout the year. Each trip offers different opportunities to go wrong. Today, we came in for lunch. We are currently going on 40+ minutes for nachos and fish and chips. Upon asking the bartender/ order taker, we came to find out that they only had one cook in and some people were experiencing two hour waits.Overall, this place offers fairly good American-ish foods, if you're lucky enough to have an incident-free experience which seems to be a highly improbable event.",
