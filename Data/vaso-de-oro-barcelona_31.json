    "Had the steak foie (as recommended by our reviews) and it did not disappoint. It was quite fatty tasting which is why it was so good. Paid 22 euros and they only take cash. Went right at opening and the place was empty. Great atmosphere as the bartender was singing all the time and clearly loved his job.",
