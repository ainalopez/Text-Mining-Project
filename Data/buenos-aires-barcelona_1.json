    "One of the best meals in a loooong time! Classy, nice and beautiful Argentinian restaurant with friendly, attentive staff. Had the beef filet with baked potatoes and also fries and it tasted great. Chose the Malbec Rutini wine which was great - the staff really helped us select the right wine for us. For dessert we had brownie and the pudding con leche - both really good!",
