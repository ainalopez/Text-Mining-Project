    "Me encanta El Bitxo. \u00a0One of my favorite places when I'm want a cozy, chill yet sophisticated atmosphere. \u00a0El Bitxo offers warm lighting, nice wine, a few tapas (traditional and creative) and always has a fresh beautiful oversized flower arrangement. \u00a0It's the first spot that I take people to when they come to visit me in Barcelona. \u00a0I like sitting at the bar, where they have fans for hot days or in the corner so I can see everything - beware the bench seat sometimes pinches. \u00a0The menu is handwritten in front of the bar. \u00a0I always enjoy talking to the people that work there too - it's that warm and familiar.It's especially wonderful because at night you can enjoy the beautifully lit Palau de la Musica, a 5 second stroll away.",
