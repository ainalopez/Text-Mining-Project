    "To start, I'd like to say that this is probably one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. If you've got the choice and the weather is nice, sit outside. The plaza, the narrow streets and the kids playing around all added to the neighborly atmosphere. It almost felt like a movie scene.Food was superb. The navajas are a must to try while in Spain, because they're not easy to find on the other side of the world. The choquitos followed up and then the cod, which was cooked to silky perfection and doused in a smoked cheese (!) sauce. For dessert, we had two different things: crema catalana and texturas de chocolate (chocolate textures). Both delicious, especially the chocolate one which came with different versions of chocolate served in a small glass jar.We had a couple of bottles of a nice, crisp white wine, which was recommended by the server (can't remember if it was a sommelier).Service was at the level of fine dining and wasn't ever pretentious or uncomfortable.This is a place I will be returning to and recommending highly to anyone who comes to Barcelona.",
