    "What a great place! The moment we walked in, we could sense a good vibe about the place. The staff was friendly, the food (and cocktails) were great, and the decor was a nice change of pace from the other places in Barcelona we visited. We had the Filet Mignon, Pork Tenderloin, and our 9 year old had the pork ribs. Everything was gone at the end. Our 9 year old even ate the empa\u00f1adas! Unfortunately, we headed back home to the US, but wanted to give this place great reviews. They deserve it.",
