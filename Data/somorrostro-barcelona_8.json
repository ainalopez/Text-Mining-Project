    "One of the best restaurants I've ever been to in all of my travels! \u00a0Just spectacular. \u00a0Came here twice for dinner during our weeklong stay in Barcelona. Everything we ordered was exceptional. The paella was spectacular! \u00a0It may not be listed on the menu, but I think they have it all the time. \u00a0Very reasonably priced and the staff is extraordinary. Nice family run spot and you can tell they take pride in what they do. \u00a0Will definitely be returning on our next trip to Barcelona!",
