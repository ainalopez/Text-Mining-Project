    "Fantastic place. Warm and inviting, with a beautiful central dining room. Colourful and tastefully lit, comfortable and unpretentious. Everything we had from salt cod fritters to oxtail stew and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was delicious and very good value. I'd definitely return. For those who want to complain about tap water, inefficient service or a (very modest) charge for bread when, pick another continent to visit!",
