    "Stunning interior!This place has several restaurants/bars housed under one roof. Think of an open air market with excellent cuisine, several choices, the ability to walk around, and all in one 5 star hotel.It definitely is worth checking out as there are food choices for everyone and you can't do much better anywhere for the ambience.Bottom Line - In Barcelona, Go!",
