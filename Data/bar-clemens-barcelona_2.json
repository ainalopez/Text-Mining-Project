    "We scoped out the entire market before choosing to eat here. This place is located in the back left corner of the market and could have been easily missed.At about 2 pm, we were one of the past tables before closing and many dishes were sold out. Still, we enjoyed the scallops, prawns and mixed vegetables. Prior to this meal, I was avoiding scallops like an ex boyfriend, but these scallops made me remember why I liked them in the first place. Simply grilled on a half shell and dressed with olive oil.",
