    "Still walking around marcado, we really wanted to get some jamon. There are lots of different places in this area that serve tapas so it was a challenge to pick a place. After walking around in circles, this place caught our attention so decided to give it a try. We only tried jamon, iberico selection, wine, and the bread with tomato. For CINCO JOTAS jamon alone, this place deserves a 5! Thinly sliced, melts in your mouth like butter, not overly salty or seasoned. Not like pork jerky (which some jamon I have tasted felt like...) delicious! (BUT!!! I don't think this is the only place that serves cinco jotas - i believe it's more of a brand that is served at high end places so didn't want to give this place all the credit.)Their bread with the tomato was one of the better ones I have tasted. They used decent amount of salt and i think it was tomato puree not whole tomato. The iberico selection ... my suggestion. skip. just order the full plate of the cinco jotas that the employee is manually slicing ever so carefully in the middle of this tiny establishment. Wine was solid, they have menus in MULTIPLE languages... Oh... jamon. I think we're hooked.",
