    "I was a bit skeptical since the hotel had recommended the place, however, we decided to give it a try. \u00a0We were quite surprised! \u00a0We had a great meal including tapas, starters, salads, main course, etc. \u00a0I had a view into the kitchen and was watching the chef checking all of the dishes as they left the kitchen. \u00a0The service was awesome. \u00a0We were there a long time and never felt rushed. \u00a0I would, absolutely, go back again.",
