    "the famous places bring tourists mostly and high prices. \u00a0quite expensive for a stall, but was tasty. \u00a0chef has a sister restaurant in Beijing called Migas. \u00a0closed sun/mon. \u00a0they start preparing food at 7 am, but you don't need to arrive until after the market is open. \u00a0would order the egg dishes made from scratch such as with chipirones or the seasonal llanqueta (tiny fried fish). nice runny eggs. \u00a0can see how they cook in different pans (steel vs. cast iron) with a lot of oil and the sea salt to get the wet sauce just right. \u00a0the grilled octopus with leeks was delicious but also salty. \u00a0same with the oxtail with potato (more starchy), bold savory flavor, salty, perfect with the excellent baguette bread. \u00a0if comparing this place and Pinotxo, then would go to Pinotxo first, especially with better prices and also great flavors there.",
