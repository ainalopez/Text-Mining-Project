    "This was the third stop for our \"The Barcelona Taste\" tapas tour. Its main feature was the amazing desserts. I can't quite remember all of them, but they were all delicious. My girlfriend especially liked the chocolate dessert. I would like to come back here again and maybe try out the regular tapas as well.",
