    "(this review for the pintxos bar ONLY and not for the restaurant in the rear)being in barcelona for the first time, my husband + i decided to take in the fare of 'pintxos' for dinner (see Lee H.'s great review of what this means).the front of this venue is the pintxos bar, where you stand at the bar that is laden with trays and trays of large hors-devours pierced with toothpicks. \u00a0you request a plate from the wait staff or barista behind the bar (there was only 1 poor lady behind the bar to rotate the pintxos plate/serve plates/give change for bills, etc.) and go ahead and go wild in choosing: \u00a0some are cold, some are hot. \u00a0if you can't decide what to get have an entire grasp of catalan/spanish, you're kinda on your own. \u00a0there are no placard signs naming the pintxos or explaining in catalan/spanish/english what each is. \u00a0so experiment + try everything that looks appealing to the eyes. \u00a0we did. \u00a0for the most part, we were successful in choosing delicious hot/cold pintxos. \u00a0thank God we avoided the shellfish looking ones (i'm allergic + hand epi-pen in tow). \u00a0if in doubt, i had my husband try it first. \u00a0standing room only at the bar (there are no seats), so be comfortable in whatever footwear you choose to use. \u00a0at the end of your gluttonous period of devouring as many pintxos as possible, you request the bill + hand over your used plate with toothpicks. \u00a0the bill is on the honor system: \u00a0you hand the plate over to the waitress behind the counter, she counts the number of toothpicks (the charge is ~ 1, 80\u20ac/toothpick) + gives you the bill. \u00a0between the two of us, there were 20 toothpicks during our dinner. \u00a0you do the math. \u00a0no nonsense service (i think she was a bit peeved about being the only one behind the counter to service ~ 20 people on the other side) that requires a bit of patience to be served, yet they still give you a smile in return.",
