    "This place is soooo good. It's off the beaten path. The food was so cheap I ordered two pastas. Don't let the the low prices fool you. This is some good stuff. A glass of wine and desert comes with your meal. \u00a0The chefs seem to compete over their specialties. They were eager to hear our opinions of our favorites. I'm only in Barcelona for five nights but I will be back.",
