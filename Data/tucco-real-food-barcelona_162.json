    "Very minimalistic and cheap for an all inclusive 6.60 Euro menu of a pasta dish, bread and dessert or espresso. \u00a0Pasta to me wasn't as good as a place in the same hood down the street Pasta Fresca, but both have good salads. \u00a0Star to me was the desserts, dulce con leche, cheesecake and tiramisu. \u00a0Beats all tourist spots and expensive prices. \u00a0Fresh Real Food is their motto! \u00a0Empanadas de Argentina as well! \u00a0Big ones! \u00a0Friend adored rich cheese ravioli. \u00a0I thought pasta was a little overcooked.",
