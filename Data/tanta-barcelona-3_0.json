    "Highly recommend this place! Really nice ambience so great place for a date! Got a lunch menu/combo and it is phenomenal. Definitely try the chicken wings. The sauce was delicious. 9 euros but came with a huge portion. I tried the \"aeropuerto chi jao Kay\" which was the chicken fried rice. Pretty good Asian fusion dish. If I have to pick on something it's that the service was pretty slow and it's somewhat pricey. But overall great!",
