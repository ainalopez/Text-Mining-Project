    "A fine dining experience, definitely not just a tapas bar. Elegant and posh inside, but there are a few tables out on the pavement if you feel you're not well-dressed enough. Their specialty is seafood, and definitely cod. To Brits and North Americans, cod is usually just battered and eaten with chips. The Spanish, however, love it and prepare it with all sorts of extras to give it flavour. At L'Amfora you can get salt cod prepared with garlic, with cheese, baked or grilled, and more. My wife had the simplest form of the dish and wasn't super impressed. However, I had a version that was baked with tomato and cream sauce and thought it very good. You'll drop EUR15 for a starter and EUR25 for a main, but it's quality dining. Just remember to give the taste and texture of cod a second chance, and go for a version that's tarted up with lots of sauce.",
