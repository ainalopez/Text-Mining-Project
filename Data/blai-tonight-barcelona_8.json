    "5 stars for the tapas, -1 because it was freezing and the room is wide open with windows and the door. But back to the food. These tapas were so tasty and obviously the right price at \u20ac1/piece. The place is filled with locals having a good time even though we went on a Wednesday, and the two guys running the place (father and son, perhaps?) were very helpful and friendly. My favorite was the avocado/caviar/pico de gallo tapas, though everything is awesome. My friend really enjoyed her vino de la casa, too. I hope to be back one day!",
