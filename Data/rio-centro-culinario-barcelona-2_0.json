    "We are part time residents in Barcelona living in El Born. \u00a0We love the great selection of restaurants, eateries and cafes but like to get out of the hustle and bustle when the neighborhood gets slammed with tourists as it inevitably does during the summer months. \u00a0If you meander out towards the Parc de la Ciutadella in the morning, you can enjoy a nice cool stroll through the park's walking paths and head to this new bakery/cafe. \u00a0The owners, a young Brazilian couple, are welcoming hosts. \u00a0They have created a bright and airy space where they serve authentic Brazilian treats like p\u00e3o de queijo, brigadeiros and coxinha, all made from scratch without compromise. \u00a0They also have delicious Saula coffee, a premium arabica that is hard to find in this area. \u00a0As the owner is also of Portuguese descent, I am hoping they will consider making authentic pastel de nata that so far we have only found worth ordering in Portugal.",
