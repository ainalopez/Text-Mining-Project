    "Yes!!!! I really enjoyed this tapas spot. After spending the morning with cranky, tired teenagers who wanted nothing more than to find free wi-fi, arriving to Bilbao-Berria was a godsend.Adults, eating \"adult-like\"food (read: not cheese pizza) during a busy ouch hour....but still searching for free wi-fi. (Can't win 'em all.)Anyhow, the service was good, our server explained everything in Spanish and English and took us up to the food to tellus what everything was and how all tapas were a flat rate per pincho price. I had my share of delicious meats on a stick, but I never had seafood on a stick, and that is what stuck with me---perfectly seared scallops on a stick. Fantastic. After a filling lunch, I wasn't dreading going back to the crabby teens. As much.",
