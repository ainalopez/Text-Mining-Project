    "5 stars for their lemon tart, and desserts in general - never had a meal there! The lemon tart is a true beast: its salted crunchy almond cookie crust, tangy and sour lemon filling and the sweet merengue...heavenly! The best! I wouldnt want to have lunch or dine there as I don't see dining as their strong point. However I do keep returning for something sweet......",
