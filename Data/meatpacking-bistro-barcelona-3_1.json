    "The decoration is lovely and I like the music. The \"city brunch\" was great but the coffee was terrible. Not to mention that if you get the fried eggs brunch prepare yourself for disappointment. The people are nice and its a cool place to chill. I would give it five stars but the price is to high for an ok amount.",
