    "As I am very slowly transitioning into a vegetarian I try and explore vegetarian/vegan restaurants in Barcelona. So far so good! Tomatoe soup with avocado and tofu was very good, as was a dish of lentils with some nice spices. Unfortunately they have run out of carrot cake for dessert but the chocolate mousse was yummy.I think the selection is great and anyone can find something they'll enjoy. Good service, nice atmosphere, international clientele. Overall, nice experience.",
