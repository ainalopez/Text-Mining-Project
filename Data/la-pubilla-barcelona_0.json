    "It was our last dinner and night in Barcelona, so we decided to take a break from the busy touristy parts of Las Ramblas and venture into hipster Gracia. We were also tired of eating cured meats, tapas and seafood for 3 days straight--as amazing as it all was, we wanted to see what else we could relish in.We arrived at La Pubilla at 830pm without reservations, but Mateo--our bartender/server--welcomed us warmly to sit at the bar. We asked for his recommendations and were extremely satisfied!Though the restaurant is small, the service and quality of food is what makes it fantastic. This is one of the details we noticed when comparing restaurants in Europe to America--the Europeans seem to really take pride! Mateo recommended the meat croquettes, duck with pear, scallops with mushrooms, fried egg on top of potato cream topped with freshly shaved white truffles (omg), beef filet with foie gras and lobster rice.All you could hear from us was \"mmm\" and \"ooohhhh\" while we were tearing up the dishes. Every single one was so full of flavor and unique. At the end we ordered a chocolate sponge cake with raspberry sorbet and chocolate truffles. ALL AMAZING. To finish it off, Mateo cheered us with Limoncello! I highly recommend this place--we had a wonderful experience and it was the best meal we had in Barcelona. Make sure you book reservations though because it gets busy!!!!",
