    "Had the most AMAZING dinner on the first night to BARCELONA with one of my friends thanks to Yelp and thanks to Sensi. \u00a0 I have to upload the photos here, but the experience was so memorable and such a pleasantly warm welcome to the city, that we went back one additional time.How I would describe it: \u00a0Modern and intimate with some old world touches mixed with some fusion dishes (pork tataki tapas were AMAZING).Our server made it a great night and we kicked it off with cava and followed his advice. We ordered the following on our first night:-baby chorizo sausage braised in beer (scrumptious)-normandy-style casserole (delicious)-Grilled goat cheese salad (ok, but was a bit too sweet for my liking)-MUSHROOM Cataluna (my absolute FAVORITE)-Pork Tataki (Japan meets Spain...grrrrr... Love)I admittedly was a bit tipsy on the 2nd try, but my fave:-padron peppersOne warning: \u00a0wait can be long b/c it is a small restaurant Come, Bebe, La Vida es Breve!!!! \u00a0When I am on vacation, I say Si, si!",
