    "The menus are in English! & espa\u00f1ol. Brunch & Cake is a very cute brunch restaurant in downtown Barcelona. They have healthy options and they also have many high calorie indulgences like the coconut bread (which is amazing). I ordered the quinoa salad because the acai bowl wasn't available and it was mas o menos. I didn't finish half of it. I also ordered the Colombia smoothie that has papaya, mango, and passion fruit and that was so, SO good. Mom ordered the eggs benedict with turkey on a waffle and she said it was the best she's had. I took a bite of the hollandaise, egg, and waffle and it was very good.",
