    "The food here was absolutely amazing and delicious. This was such a lovely local experience in La Barceloneta. \u00a0We would have eaten here every day had we not felt guilty not to try other places. The service was good, the beer was cold and the atmosphere was great. The only suggestion would be a cleaner bathroom.",
