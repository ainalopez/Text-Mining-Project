    "My husband and I came here for dinner and we were definitely impressed. Service was amazing and the staff made us feel comfortable. The menu is translated for you as well, which was awesome for us since we do not speak the language. You have to eat outside to get a feel for the city. The tapas are amazing and decently priced. The sangria was actually not on \u00a0the menu, but they have it and it was only 6 euros. I recommend the sangria for sure! For my sweet tooth cravings, we had to try the crema Catalan and it is for sure a step up from creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (very delicious). I was sad when all the food was gone. But we will be coming back here for sure.",
