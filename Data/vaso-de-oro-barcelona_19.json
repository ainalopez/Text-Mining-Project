    "From the outside, this looks like the perfect place for a nice glass of beer. But there is more. Open the door to one of the best Tapas places I've visited in Barcelona. Inside you will see a typical but beautifully looking brown bar. The staff is neatly dressed and takes your order in a jiffy. We went for the spicy chorizo balls, manchego cheese platter, patatas bravas and the best of all: steak and peppers. Everything was lovely but I really gotta recommend this one to you. No hablo Ingles very well. No wifi. Oh yeah, Tax is not included in the prices mentioned on the menu card. But hey, you want the real thing, right? Then you have to go here. It can be very crowded in here so visit them early. It's a hidden treasure. Glad we found it.",
