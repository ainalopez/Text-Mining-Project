    "Due to its location, menu translated into 7 languages, and not to mention paellas that are reviewed well, \"Set Portes\" is bounding with tourists, but that doesn't mean they serve tired fun-of-the-mill food. Yes, reservations are recommended, or else you can stand on a line for half an hour. We tried the paella parellada (21.90\u20ac), cassoleta de muscles al vapor (10.60\u20ac), cr\u00e8ma catalana (6.70\u20ac). I haven't had many paellas to compare theirs against, but the serving was yummy and proportionate for two people (though I would've wanted more seafood in it). I'm not familiar with local dining customs, but they billed us 2.40\u20ac per person for the bread that they automatically gave us for starters... seems like a lot for bread.",
