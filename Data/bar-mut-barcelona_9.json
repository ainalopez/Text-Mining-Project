    "Even with all the hype this place delivered and then some. Ordered the steak with foie, egg carpaccio, and octopus and each one of them was incredible. The octopus was without question the best I've ever had and sadly the best I will ever have because there is no way it can be made better without the assistance of wizardry. Seriously it was that good.Four stars because the place is small and cramped, but at the same time quite expensive. Other than that, it was an amazing experience.",
