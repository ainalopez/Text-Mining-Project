    "If you are looking for a place around the Gotic to enjoy the archetypical Basc pintxo (a loaf of bread with some delicacies on top that range from Jamon to Cheese among others), this is one of the good places to be. Many years ago, this type of restaurants were a kind of difficult to find, but from time to now they have proliferated a lot in Barcelona. I am happy with that because I like the vibe and the food of these places. We had some cold and some warm pintxos, and I have to say that they were good (not stellar, but hey, every pintxo costs 1.95 euros). The service was correct and polite. The only problem was that the doors were open and the cold from the AC was lost in a really warm night, besides it's a waste of energetic resources.",
