    "Such a cute little shop with a very nice guy behind the counter. Simple, but satisfying sandwiches. I got the proscuitto and brie, which I liked, and the bf got \"The Best Chicken Sandwich\" which he really enjoyed. We got the combo so the drinks were essentially free. We had an enjoyable time partaking in our sandwiches in Parc Guell and would totally go back here for the food and the nice guy in the place!",
