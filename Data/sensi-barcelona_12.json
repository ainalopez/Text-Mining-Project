    "In a very busy and cozy street in the middle of Bairo Gotico this small, well decorated and always crowded restaurant will give you a good taste of Barcelona.You must reserve to be able to sit here, you should go for a \"late diner\" (22-23h) and bring an appetite cause the tapas are amazing!Its not the cheapest spot but its totally worth it, great Sangria and a good set of good and unique tapas (crema catalan con championes, crema de cenora, patatas bravas, jamon y queso...)Definitely a place to visit and enjoy!",
