    "The restaurant is basically self-served. \u00a0You find a table or pick a spot at the bar counter, then you decide what to eat by picking the tapas dishes from the shelves on the bar counter. \u00a0Each dish has a toothpick. \u00a0At the end, the waitress counts the number of sticks (each stick is \u20ac1.65) and bill you. \u00a0Food is excellent, especially you get to try many many dishes. \u00a0We sampled many tapas and all are excellent.",
