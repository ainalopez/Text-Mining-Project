    "As a tourist gently pushing your way through the throng of animated locals to the counter at La Cova, the only words of Catalan you'll need to know are this: Las bombas de marica.That's what my charming Catalonian colleague Sharon told us, anyway. And she was right: as soon as we uttered those magical words, we were warmly greeted with two short glasses of house red wine and only moments later, the culinary phenomenon known as bombas.What's a bomba? Well for starters, 'la bomba' (yes, 'the bomb' - the name is loaded with political innuendos) was invented at this very restaurant back in I believe the 1930s. Though the breaded ball resembles a basic potato-based croquette, there's nothing ordinary about it: A ball of creamy mashed potatoes is rolled with bread crumbs, it's then deep-fried to a golden hue and blissfully topped with a garlic aioli before being artfully dotted with a fiery red sauce. I may have seen a glimpse of God at Sagrada Familia, but it was at La Cova Fumada that I experienced heaven. Besides the bombas, you should also try the cod (blanketed in either a cream or red sauce), grilled calamari and the tomato-rubbed bread.If I had to identify one food item I'll miss most from Spain, it's these bombas housed in an unmarked restaurant in the Barceloneta neighborhood (hint: it's steps away from the market). I'd advise you to learn a little Catalan so you can pay respects to the local, non-English speaking staff and patrons... authenticity is definitely a quality they want to preserve in this tiny bodega.Forget Gaudi... it's for these babies that I'll return to Barcelona!",
