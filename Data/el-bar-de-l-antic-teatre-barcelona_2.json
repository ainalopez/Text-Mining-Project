    "Wow, I got so lost trying to find this place that first time. \u00a0But such a gem of a location - especially when the weather is perfect for sitting on the terrassa under that giant fig tree. \u00a0Cava and beers are nice and cheap too - like 2-3 euros each.No waiter service - you have to go to the bar. \u00a0But they bus the tables and keep things nice and clean.",
