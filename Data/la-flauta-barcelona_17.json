    "I went here about 5 different times when I visited Barcelona, and they have the best tapas ever. They definitely have some of the best patatas bravas in Barcelona. The sandwiches here are TO DIE FOR. I think I tried every single one on the menu, and I am proud of it! The restaurant itself is very nice as well, and I cannot wait to get back to Barcelona just to eat here.",
