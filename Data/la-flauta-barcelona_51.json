    "This was a great, homey neighborhood-feeling place with very good food. \u00a0We sat upstairs, good, friendly service. \u00a0We just ordered a bunch of things off the menu, and I wish we could have ordered some meat items, but we had to accommodate a vegetarian/pescatarian in the group (not that there's anything wrong with that, but limiting my menu choices when I'm trying to get as much of the local flavor is frustrating). \u00a0The grilled vegetable platter was fine, tastes like every other place, but I enjoyed the grilled and fried octopus, croquetas, shrimp and clams. \u00a0Really enjoyed.",
