    "I think this is my favorite Indian restaurant in Gr\u00e0cia. In Barcelona maybe.First of all, the service is kind and welcoming.The ambiance is laid back and elegant. It is a big locale.The prices per appetizer are about 3/4\u20ac, and per plate from 8-10/11 maybe. Good pricing for amazing food.The food though, wow wow wow is so good. Especially their Chicken Tikka Masala is delicious. Their onion bhaji are really good as well, and so are the samosas. Really, it's hard to find a good chicken tikka masala anywhere in this city, and here I finally found one.Great place with a great view, and you will not be disappointed!",
