    "The burgers here were ok, definitely not the best vegan burgers I've encountered in my travels. The patties they used had abit of a funny flavour that the spices didn't quite mask and the atmosphere within the store was not very welcoming. The server was not very helpful in translating to English although that was not his fault! I got a cinnamon scroll for dessert which was ok aswell but probably wouldn't return",
