    "Homey atmosphere, wonderful service, and great food at this charming restaurant in the northeast Born neighborhood! Recommended by our hosts at the Pillow Rooms boutique hotel, we were amply rewarded with an excellent dining experience for our last night in Barcelona. Highlights include the strawberry mojito, followed by an excellent local red wine, potatoes bravas, pumpkin ravioli, and special ice cream. We loved it all!",
