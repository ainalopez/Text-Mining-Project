    "If you like Tapas, you must visit this bar on the Passeig de Gracia, Barcelona. Not really expensive but perhaps a little more than other tapas bars. Gets very crowded lunchtimes and also late evenings (about 10pm onwards.) The choice of tapas is mind boggling and it is no surprise that it is as good as it is, being a member of the An Grup. The house wines and house dry sherries are excellent.",
