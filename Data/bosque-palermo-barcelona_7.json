    "Amazing food. The first restaurant that I stopped for a meal in Barcelona. Very glad to have my first dinner in Barcelona at Bosque Palermo. I ordered pan con tomate (a Catalonian must!), a pitcher of sangria, and the seafood paella to share with two of my friends. The pan con tomate was perfectly crispy, and the tomato spread was thick and juicy. My group devoured it whole. It was 1,50 per person. \u00a0The paella was very very fresh and it was gorgeously plated. We were given generous amounts of seafood (mussels, shrimp, squid and other chunks of seafood in the most fragrant broth. The service was fantastic and I left a happy customer. I paid about 12 euros for sangria, pan con tomate and paella. Definitely coming back and definitely referring people to come here to have their first taste of real Spanish paella.",
