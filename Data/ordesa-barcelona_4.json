    "Deserving of its three star average. Looking for a tapas place recommended by a friend we thought we had found it until we got our food. Don't get the calamari, it is chewy and uninspiring. The fried Camembert was good though isn't every fried cheese? Service was good despite other reviews. Search for ab better place within a few blocks, there are plenty to choose from.",
