    "Went for lunch today which was awesome, my wife and I are big fans of Greek food and loved their lunch menu here. Lots of options and came with starter, drink,( had a beer yum), entree, and dessert. 10 euros #winning We both got different things each course and shared. Awesome food don't skip dessert. Or the pita bread or the humus.",
