    "It's Jaica time of year again! Sunny spring afternoons spent tapeando in a busy energetic informal bar that just has something special. Perhaps it's what we want the entire neighbourhood of Barceloneta to be like but this feeling only exists within these Jaica walls.Simple small plates to share with friends in a crowded yet relaxed environment, a perfect stop before/after a stroll along the beach!",
