    "Tapas in Barcelona is ubiquitous. Like coffee in Seattle, there's a lot to chose from, which makes it very easy to have an average to bad experience and not know any better. And yet there are enough good ones that this should never happen. If you try enough tapas you will discover that most are forgettable and not worth your time. And while there are several that are good, a very few will clearly stand out. Elsa Y Fed is among the latter. It is simply outstanding and worth a visit on any trip to Barcelona. The restaurant is quaint and inviting; more like someone's living room with a bar inside than a restaurant. And this atmosphere combined with understated and excellent service (though very Spanish) along with delicious food and great bar selection will make your time intoxicating and delightful. Go, while away the hours, and allow yourself the pleasure of relaxing over a wonderful meal in one of the great cities in the world. You won't be disappointed. And afterwards, wander through the nearby Parc de la Ciutadell. It will make for a terrific day.Oh, and the word is out on this place. So make reservations, or arrive between lunch and dinner, because otherwise you will wait :) Though even if you do, it is worth it.",
