    "Very popular place on Yelp some friends knew about and wanted to take us there. Absolutely perfect spot to check while in Barcelona. We sat outside with only a few minutes wait, and ordered tapas to share between us. We went for a first batch of 5-6 and had to order few more to get full. The plates are ok sized but we needed a few more to get our stomach ok, not to mentioned we were starving while getting there. They have all the classics and do get them, there are none to be disappointed with. Big point for this place on top of everything listed above is that due to the look and feel of it, we were expecting a much higher check after adding drinks and not at all. Prices are quite decent for a prime spot and location like this. Walking distance from las ramblas and way better food options and quality than all the touristy spots sitting on the avenue.",
