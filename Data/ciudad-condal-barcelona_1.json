    "This is an amazing place. Once you go in turn to left and ask to put your name down. I had a party of 2 and the wait about 30 minutes after 9pm. Line moves quick for smaller parties. Unlike other places I've been in southern Spain, you can't just walk up and order tapas, you have to wait for your name to be called. I sat at the bar area, our server's name is Daniel from the Philippines. He is the #1 best waiter. He was friendly and gave great suggestions.Food:I stuck mainly with the seafood dishes.Vinegar anchovies \u00a0(boqueron vinagre)- these are very common tapas in Spain. Its anchovies in vinegar and olive oil. RecommendedPrawns \u00a0(Gamba Roja Plancha)- These are very large sized prawns and are delicious.Grilled baby squid (Chipiron Andaluza) - Small baby squid grilled. Also DeliciousBeef tenderloin (Solomillio) - This is medium done beef with a grilled peper (not spicy). Good but a little too much meat compared to seafood I ordered.Special Saute (Saleado Especial) -- saute calmarie, mushroom, jamon. The was a good mixture of seafood and ham that is so popular in Spain.I really liked the food. With a glass of white wine and five dishes the mean was 43 euros.",
