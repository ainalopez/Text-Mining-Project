    "Best lunch in Barcelona. We only found it thanks to our Lonely Planet guide book because there was no sign, only a building number above a dark brown wooden door. Doesn't get more authentic or fresh than this. The restaurant doesn't have a fridge since all the food is bought from the market next door right before cooking; the menu of the day is written on a chalkboard. We shared a table (long bench) with two old ladies. It was loud, crowded, a bit smoky and very cozy. We had their signature dish \"bombas\" (potato croquettes), grilled artichokes, sardines, and calamari with their delicious tomato toast. Everything was amazing. Our waiter was very friendly and patient with us.",
