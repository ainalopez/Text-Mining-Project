    "Came with a group of 8 and we all got the tacos al pastor due to the rave reviews here. While not the best al pastor tacos I've had (nothing beats the shady taco stands in Texas where you can get a life-changing taco for $1), but they were really good and authentic. The pineapple was a great touch and the salsas were pretty good. My only gripe is that the portions are pretty small for 8 euro - the 4 tacos are tiny and we were just barely full. I'd also recommend the guayaba agua fresca - so good and refreshing!",
