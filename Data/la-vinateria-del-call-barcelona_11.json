    "La Vinateria is great for cheeses and wines, perfect pa amb tom\u00e0quet , cold cuts and other accompaniments to wine. It's got one of the most thoughtful wine lists in the city, and the mark-ups are very reasonable. I've been going here regularly and frequently for 18 years and it's never let me down. It's a narrow, dark, wood-panelled place, which is never less than completely full every evening, lively, buzzing, authentic, run by Miquel, who is passionate about his establishment, and very Barcelona. You can sometimes get a table by just turning up, but it's recommendable to book. In the heart of the Jewish Quarter, in the the Gothic Quarter. Still relatively unknown by tourists, but well-loved by locals, and for very good reasons! This remains one of my favourite places in the world to have dinner in. It just makes me very happy.",
