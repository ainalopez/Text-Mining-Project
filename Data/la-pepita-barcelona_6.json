    "We were lucky to find this place and enjoy their delicious tapas. Everything was amazing! We ordered the steak tartare, tuna with grilled veggies, foie gras with white chocolate mousse, croquettas , and pan con tomate. The service was amazing, everyone was so nice and attentive. I loved the hipster vibe. You can really taste the well seasoned and flavorful passion in every dish. Nothing comes out the kitchen mediocre, bravo! I wish you guys the best success and long tenure.",
