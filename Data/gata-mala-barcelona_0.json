    "Tonight at Gata Mala, I had the best meal of my life. Of all the restaurants in the world I have tried, this is my favourite. Not only is the tapas indescribably beyond delicious, but the prices are extremely reasonable. With every couple of drinks, a free small plate is included.We arrived for our second night here in a row. As soon as we entered, Pinar greeted us with such amazing warmth and hospitality. We asked her to simply give us delicous food. Her and her staff did not disappoint.The first plate was a simple yet delicious one. Pieces of baguette topped with cold shaved ham, paprika and olive oil. The second, my personal favourite, was a four cheese, zuchinni and leek pie served piping hot. The third was succulently roasted potatoes in olive oil loaded with pureed tomatoes and a delicious hallandaise-esque lemon garlic sauce. Next, we were served legendary cold long sliced veggies in olive oil topped with hot goat cheese and cracked black pepper. To finish, we were each given one piece of bread topped with fresh roasted pork belly.After stuffing myself for an amazingly low price, I decided to go home and rest. As I left, I noticed Pinar smoking on the curb and told her how wonderful my experience was. Truly the best tapas I could imagine. As she beamed with happiness and kissed me on the cheek, I realised that I felt so at home here despite being halfway across the world. My night at Gata was one I will never ever forget.If you are in Barcelona, eating at Gata Mala should be right at the top of your list. It is not only a meal you will never forget, but an experience you'll cherish forever.",
