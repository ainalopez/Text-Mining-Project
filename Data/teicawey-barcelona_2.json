    "Wow. Not really great food. I really want to give this place 3 stars because of how cool the inside is in terms of a Mexican supermarket, because if that was the only thing I was rating this could get like 4-5 stars, but the actual food is a no no. However, 2 stars is what it gets for the following problems:I was expecting so much more from such a beautiful store. The food was actually really not that good. The burrito I got had too much rice and not really flavor, and the flavor that it did have made me not able to eat the other half of it. They have no classics either, so you can't just order a normal black bean burrito because they don't really sell that.The service here is also pretty aloof and not really welcoming. I sort of felt laughed at when I walked in and ordered a burrito, and not in a good way. The people at the bar sort of expect you to understand all of their strange concoctions.It's really a shame that the food isn't good, because the other part of this store, as in all the awesome Mexican products, is really cool. They have hot sauces, and cool candy, beers, cooking supplies, I could go on. That part is cool.In a great area, but I think that if you're looking for some good Mexican food, you may be better off somewhere else.",
