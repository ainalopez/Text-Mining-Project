    "We love Bar Celta and always have done, we used to always visit the previous location and as soon as we landed in Spain we headed there for our dinner in the new location of El Born. My husband would usually have the octopus which he loves but he didn't this time. We did however have their bravas which I love and their pimientos del padron are some of the best we had. The atmosphere is quite local and fun, the prices are pretty cheap and the food is good. What else could you want?More info on the blog if you want mylifeinsin.com/2015/03/\u2026",
