    "Where do I even begin. \u00a0If you aren't from Spain or are not a foodie or in the industry, you were introduced to the Adria brothers by way of the many documentaries about El Bulli. \u00a0When I planned my vacation to Barcelona, I knew I had to eat at one of their restaurants. \u00a0This place is unreal. \u00a0It has the best of everything. \u00a0Informal or formal dress if you want. \u00a0The staff is attentive, informative and warm. \u00a0Every detail of dinner is explained. \u00a0They were in contact a month in advance to work around food allergies and other personal food challenges. \u00a0Every dish and aspect of service is the best I've ever had. \u00a0The food itself is on another level. \u00a0I will only say it is one of the best meals I've ever had and will look forward to my next visit. \u00a0You'd be an idiot to not make a reservation here if you are headed to Catalonia. \u00a0Muchas gracias to Chefs Kyoko Li and Jorge Munoz!",
