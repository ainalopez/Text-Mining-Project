    "Let me start by saying that everything was really good - except (and it is probably me) the coarsed ground meat. I think it is a particular for how they do it in Spain, but it is too coarsely chopped. Because the beef is the star, I can only give 2 stars. However the staff was great, the decor was nice, the buns awesome, the thick cut fries above standard. So if you are not a stranger to to coarsely chopped ground beef, you should definitely go. If you are used to american style ground meat (double grinded), you might experience similar to myself.",
