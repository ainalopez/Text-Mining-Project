    "Best carne paella I've had in Spain with delicious chunks of pork, chicken, and rabbit at a very reasonable price, making Pitarra a good option for hungry travelers and Catalans alike. In addition to great food, Pitarra offers a terrific overall dining experience. The owner really cares what people think and goes from table to table asking how everyone enjoyed their meal. This level of customer service is a rare find on the European dining scene, maybe rarer than good paella in Spain! Pitarra is a bit off the beaten trail in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter, but it's definitely a trip worth taking.",
