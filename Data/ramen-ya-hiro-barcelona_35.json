    "We just left this place and are already craving it again. Well worth the 40 minute wait, especially if you order a beer while you wait in line. It's a small 40-50 seat, intimate restaurant and they make the Ramen noodles in-house. The wait time goes fast and the staff have it running like a machine. As soon as we were seated, we ordered and the food came pronto. \u00a0You pick from 3 types of broth and add the toppings (such as seaweed, soy beans, bamboo, egg, tofu, and meats). The portion sizes were big and we plowed through our soups pretty quickly. For desert we had the Crema Caseca de sesame ngro, which was like a sesame cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e and had a nutty sweetness that only toasted sesame could give. I rarely give a 5 rating but this place deserves a 6! We will be returning before the end of our vacation.",
