    "This secret little back road Bistro is unforgettable. After a couple of days in Barcelona we decided we'd had enough of tapas and ventured on to find some Italian delights for comfort. The Lady in charge at Pappa E Citti is a gem. She was so lovely to me an my partner all evening and catered for our every need. The menu was of a good size and variety and I think it was all of a realistic/ good price. They had lovely wines and we took a bottle recommended by the hostess. Superb. We chose the Sun dried Tomato starter which was beautiful. After we both tucked into near perfect pasta of which there was a generous portion. The tiramisu was impressive. All the food was freshly prepared and cooked no more than 10 Yards from our table. \u00a0We left feeling like we had had a special evening. We were 2/4 people eating at this little restaurant and it was almost like private dining. I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting something away from the joys of Catalan Cuisine.",
