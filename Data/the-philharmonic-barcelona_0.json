    "Sat at the bar, got quick service, pints are ~5\u20ac, they had Tv's with sports on them what more can you ask for. \u00a0If you're an American and I suspect English as this is an English pub and you're looking for a dive bar that reminds you of a run down hole in the wall with good service and a bartender who speaks English then this is the place. \u00a0Didn't eat so no comment on food",
