    "I'm in love with this pizzeria. I was broke one month but having a serious craving for some tasty non-home-cooked food, and this place certainly provided the answer to my desires. They have cheap, gigantic slices for 2 to 2.50, depending what toppings they've used-- and gigantic pies that could be meals for a person for 2-3 days. The personal pies aren't very good value (compared to other places), but the gigantic pies and slices most certainly are. My favourite American style pizzeria-- be sure to try their truffle and spicy sausage pizzas!",
