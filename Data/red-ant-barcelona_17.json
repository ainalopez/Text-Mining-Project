    "This evening I ate at RedAnt for the first time (Mon 8PM). I have enjoyed Mosquito, which I believe is the 'brother/associated restaurant of RedAnt. Because I enjoyed Mosquito's atmosphere, beer selection and food, I decided to give RedAnt a try.I would say that Mosquito is better because there is more personality on the interior. The beer selection at RedAnt is quality but not quite impressive. However, I enjoyed a nice bottled porter that the staff recommended.For food, I had a good bowl of Ramen Noodles with oven baked pork in the soup. I will order that again in the future- it's a 3.8 stars out of 5. I expect that most of their food items are similarly good because there are not many items from which to choose.The staff was kind and attentive. The restaurant was clean. It was a nice place to stop in, read my Spanish newspaper and be back on my way. Perhaps, the Ramen was a bit 'salty', but good despite, and who doesn't make their Ramen salty?!",
