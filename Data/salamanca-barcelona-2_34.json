    "When the two paella restaurants we had chosen were closed for the evening, we were lured into Salamanca by their amazing display of fresh fish on ice.This was a very expensive meal and overall we were disappointed with the experience. \u00a0The paella was very smoky in flavor and the fish not very tasty. \u00a0We had already had better paella for less from a street cafe. \u00a0The restaurant is comfortable with a family operated feel to the place. \u00a0However, we found the waitstaff a bit pushy for our taste.Our dinner was accompanied by a wandering accordionist. \u00a0Perhaps you enjoy being serenaded for tips over a fine meal, but we usually find it annoying.Would not recommend. \u00a0Your money can be better spent elsewhere, in our opinion.",
