    "I tend to have the opinion that restaurants near tourist sites will generally be of low quality so I was quite impressed with the food in this Thai place. I ate there in the summer for a menu del d\u00eda (about 13\u20ac. not especially cheap) and my \"dining companion\" and I were both very happy with the food. I would definitely go back again.Very good location as well if you're seeing the Gaudi buildings on Passeig de Gracia.",
