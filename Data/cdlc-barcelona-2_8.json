    "I liked this place, and especially the name, carpe diem-gotta seize the day!!This place is huge and reminded me a bit of Tao. \u00a0They also had these huge beds you could sit/lay in and have some drinks at (with comfy pillows, too) :P. \u00a0We just had some drinks and I liked their mojito!!You can also get some pay-what-you-wish mini massages afterwards. \u00a0The lady said most people give 10-15 euros or so for it, and someone gave 1500 (ballaaaa...).",
