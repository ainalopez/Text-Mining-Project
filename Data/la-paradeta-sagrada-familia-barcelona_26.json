    "Friend and I went for dinner. Waited about 30 minutes?The food: AMAZING. FRESH. DELICIOUS. Razor clams are a MUST. They were my favorite out of everything. Mussels were also delicious. Baby octopus I could do without. Bread was a good complement, it neutralized the seafood-y saltiness and flavors.The ambiance: Very local, busy, well-lit. Restroom was clean, which was really important because your fingers be smelling ripe after attacking all that fresh seafood.The service: As non-locals that don't speak Spanish as a first language, we were naturally pressured to make our choices, however, the lady serving us was helpful and let us know what we had picked was enough.Would I come back? Hell yes. Even with the waiting, I like to consider it as part of the experience.",
