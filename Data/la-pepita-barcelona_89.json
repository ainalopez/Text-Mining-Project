    "Crazy good but make sure you take your time before ordering another round. The sea bass with strawberries is one you don't want to miss. Went there 3-4pm on a Saturday afternoon and no lines but I can see where this would be the exception. Food is so totally worth the wait in any case. Super friendly and fast service.",
