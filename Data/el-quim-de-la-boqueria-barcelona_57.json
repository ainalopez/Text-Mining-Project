    "this place is amazing!!i still dont understand how they can make all that amazing food in such a small space( i thought my manhattan kitchen was small), but after eating here i understand that a whole lot of fancy kitchen equipment is not nesessary when theres talent. the place is always crowded so it took us a little while to get seats but im happy we waited because it was definitely worth it. the staff is super friendly and gave us the perfect recomendation, i saw a couple next to us having foei gras with mushrooms and it looked so delicious i knew i wanted to try it and it was amazing. if im ever in barcelona again i will most likely eat here every time.",
