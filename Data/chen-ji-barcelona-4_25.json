    "Bang for your buck! The soups are a meal in itself, the XL buns come 10 decent size ones. The fried rice and rest of food serving size is big! Similar to States standard. Only downfall is that they dont speak English so you need to know either Spanish or Chinese which was not a problem for me. We ate 3 soups, 2 orders of XL buns( one we had to bring back to hotel room cuz was too much) and 3 main dishes, 2 drinks for 28euros.",
