    "The best meal we had on our trip to Barcelona! \u00a0Also loved that you didn't have to order anything. \u00a0They just asked you how many tapas you wanted and to tell them what you didn't like or had allergies towards. \u00a0Everything they served us was amazingly delicious. \u00a0We devoured each plate within a couple of minutes with no shame. \u00a0There's actually a full restaurant in the back, which we didn't see and heard that you had to call 10 days ahead to make a reservation. \u00a0Where we ate was a long bar kitchen with just stools surrounding it to fit about 15 people. \u00a0The place is decorated with a variety of nice paintings. \u00a0The line outside was pretty big for lunch on a Saturday and the place wasn't even opened yet! \u00a0We waited about an hour and a half, but it was worth it.The dishes we had included: delicious bread with tomato/pepper spread? \u00a0clams in wine sauce, some sort of omelet (was insanely good), tuna tartare, fish with potatoes, a cream baked dessert.Price was comparable to the quality of food. \u00a0About 90 American dollars for two. \u00a0Will definitely come back here whenever I go back to Barcelona.",
