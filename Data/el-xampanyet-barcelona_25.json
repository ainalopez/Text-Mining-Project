    "True Barelona experience at this perfect tapas spot! It's located right in the amazing El Born District which is full of fun shopping and stops along the way. This place is small but once you squeeze in and get a table, grab a glass of wine and just tell your server to surprise you on their best menu items. The tapas are unbelievable, the wine is delicious and the atmosphere is a mix of locals and tourist and feels so perfectly Barcelona. Totally worth going out of your way for!",
