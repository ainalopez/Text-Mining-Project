    "I happened on this tapas bar as I strolled Ramblas, and the whole ambience drew me to it. The outdoor cafe tables, the interior, the beautiful design -- all were attractive. But the food here is extraordinary and unique. In a city where it is easy to find tapas of the same kind on every corner, Casa Guinart stands out for its more healthy and contemporary versions of Catalan cuisine. Yes, they have croquettes, but it is the specials of the day and the other offerings that stand out to me. The scallops in saut\u00e9ed scallions and black sausage pieces was delectable, and the grilled asparagus topped with baked goat cheese was simply the one best tapas I experienced in Barcelona. It's a bit pricey, but well worth it to have a memorable food experience in this city.",
