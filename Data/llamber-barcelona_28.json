    "Tapas made fancy... \u00a0and probably more expensive than necessary, but the food was plated up beautifully with interesting twists on the typical tapas dishes whether in shape, presentation or flavor combo. Thoughts on specific dishes: Especially tasty was the octopus rice dish with pistachio pesto and sage... rice was wayyy on the salty side but the sage was so yummy I continued eating it. Also surprisingly great was their version of traditional Catalan pan con tomate. Nice crusty seeded/hearty bread with finely chopped tomatoes (rather than just the juice of tomato rubbed in - which is what you'll find at most other restaurants). For charcuterie and cheese, definitely go with the half portions as these were already more than generous. Skip the \"cod marinated in the idea of guacamole\" - it's basically thinly sliced cod slipped between slices of avocado with a Bloody Mary reduction on top, side of root vegetable chips and random Tabasco gelees. Funny name but don't do like we did by ordering it for the novelty alone... unlike the other choices, it's more gimmicky than good.",
