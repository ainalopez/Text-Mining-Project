    "I wouldnt call this a tapas place. This is similar to what you would see in Asia (maybe not as nice, haha). I guess the tapas part is the appetizers? But the main thing are the noodle soups, YUM! They have an interesting menu because it is in Chinese, English and Catalan (I think there was English). Between the three languages I was able to figure out exactly what each food was and what to expect. The food is really good and I would recommend the dumplings. The only thing I don't like about this place is that they bring everything out at the same time instead of first bring out the appetizers and then the rest, but maybe it was because we didn't ask for it that way?The place is kind of small so it's best not to go with more than 4 people. Also, I'm not sure if you can call ahead to make reservations, but you can leave your name behind and wait in line. I would definitely be back!",
