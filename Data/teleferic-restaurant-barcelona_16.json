    "This was our last dinner in Barcelona as the other tapas bar we were going to go to was full. I was actually pretty impressed with the quality of the food v. Cost. They have different skewers that are priced differently. You can see on the sign they have up on the wall. It ranges from 1.65 pounds from the cheapest to 4.55 pounds. I ordered the anchovy, roasted eggplant, tomato, pepper bruschetta, the brie walnut and honey bruschetta and the cream cheese with peach and walnut on bread. It was actually quite filling and was 8 pounds in total. They also have different things like salmon rolls, foie gras, vegetable tempura etc. as a vegetarian, the selection wasn't bad and it was definitely reasonably priced!Overall, I recommend this place if you're in the area!",
