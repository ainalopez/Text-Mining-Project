    "The food here is \u00a0amazing!! Fresh, delicious, and NOT tapas style for once. We had the goat cheese salad (huge), one of the fruit juices (\"the regulator\"), two pastas (the truffle one is to die for) and a bottle of coke. So glad we avoided the tourist traps and came here. The serving sizes were huge too. Bill came up to 39 euros. Love love love this place!",
