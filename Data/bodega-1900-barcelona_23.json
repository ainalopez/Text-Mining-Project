    "Bodega 1900 is directly across the street from Tickets. \u00a0Bodega 1900 is much easier to get reservations for and the food and service is wonderful. \u00a0Bodega 1900 had the best service we experienced in Spain. \u00a0The waitress was very informative and would even build your meal for you. \u00a0The couple beside us allowed the waitress to build their meal and they seemed very happy with each plate that was brought out. \u00a0Of what we ordered here our my favorites in order:Gordal and Piparra OlivaFried EggplantRoasted Chicken Canelloni with FoieSmoked MackarrelIberian Ham 5 YearsHam CroquetteBread with TomatoSardinesI also ordered the house vermouth that was a must!I would love to have ordered more. \u00a0Highly recommend this restaurant!",
