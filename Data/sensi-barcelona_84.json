    "This was one of the best stops on our trip I Spain, period. Take the waiter's advice on what to order. Ours walked us through the menu and told us his favorites and he could not have guided us in a better direction. There was a ravioli, a Normandy vegetable dish, a duck timbale, papas bravas and two others -- and each dish was better than the last. The service was very quick by Spanish standards -- more similar to an American restaurant in attentiveness. Absolutely a do not miss.",
