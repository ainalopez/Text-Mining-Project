    "After being out and having a lovely meal and a lot of wine on our first night in Barcelona, we decided we needed more drinks (because why not and Saturday night). So we found ourselves at Homo Sibaris. I think the bottles of beer drew us in because the three of us are huge beer fans, so we decided to give it a try.We each only had one of the beers on tap, but mostly because we were quite drunk and the other half and I had to leave after one more. But the beer we had was alright. For me it was a bit too hoppy, but nice.The venue itself is really cool and they do have a few light bar snacks (we ordered some nachos). So I can't really judge it too much, but for a beer and a snack, it seems like a great place to stop in.",
