    "To the untrained mouth, this place might be good. But having tried the best beef noodle soups in California and NY, this place is barely cutting average. The noodles itself are decent, but broth and beef are no good. Also, I asked for XLB, and they served me pan fried dumplings. Won't be coming back and would not recommend.If you know your Chinese food, you should save your time and stick to Catalan/Spanish food in Barcelona.",
