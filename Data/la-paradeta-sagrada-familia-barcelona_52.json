    "After visiting La Sagrada Familia, we were ready to get some good food in our tummy. Without Internet (thus no Yelp!!! Oh no!!!), we turned to locals for help. \u00a0One security guard (didn't really speak much English) told us about this restaurant, and we miraculously managed to find it (since he gave us the street name when we asked him for the restaurant name). \u00a0But I am so glad that we found it!!! \u00a0There was fresh seafood (fish, crabs, small lobsters, shrimp, squid, calamari, and more), and they were sold by weight. \u00a0Then they will cook it for you (either fry or grill). \u00a0We ordered calamari, small squid, big shrimp (head on), steamed shrimp, and a small lobster. \u00a0The fried small squid, and shrimp were. Y favorite. \u00a0The shrimp was so fresh and tasted so sweet. They were probably sea caught rather than farm raised to make them taste so great. So yummy!!! Best meal during the Barcelona trip!!!",
