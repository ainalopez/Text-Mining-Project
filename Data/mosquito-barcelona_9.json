    "IT'S REALLY GOOD! It gets crowded fast. Get there as close to opening as possible, or you will have to wait. \u00a0It's a small place, so it's probably not good to with a group of more than 5 people. \u00a0It's also a good idea to come here hungry, because you will want to try everything. \u00a0I went with two other people. \u00a0We went hungry. \u00a0We shared the crispy duck (ordered a second plate because it was so damn good), pork belly, chicken bang bang, and City Pho (the beef broth is so complex in flavor it's like a meal in one spoonful), and both types of dumplings. It was all delicious. \u00a0Seriously, all of it.Plus the food, the three of us had one drink each (they have craft beer) and we were completely stuffed - for 50 euro. \u00a0Highly recommended.",
