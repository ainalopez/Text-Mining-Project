    "The very decent 10$ menu del dia for lunch is what we went here for. It was a three course meal ( first course, main dish, dessert) with bread and drink included. The gazpacho was excellent, with no cream in this one, in a rather large bowl. Croquetas were also very good, having tried many throughout Madrid and Barcelona. I chose the sea bream over potatoes for the main course, which was a whole fish and very substantial. Potatoes were delicious. Everything was plated nicely as well. The Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was subpar, but overall this was a great meal for 10$. (+) gazpacho(+) croquetas",
