    "Honest meal, cozy no frills restaurant visited by locals. Day menu (green salad, codfish with tomatoe sauce, home made cake and coffee for just 9.50\u20ac) excellent value for money, prepared in house. Great place for ordinary lunch when coming from Parc Guell. Authentic experience, not haute cuisine but good normal food.",
