    "This restaurant was a few block walk from our B&B, which recommended it. We over ordered considerably the first time there because we had no idea of portion size, but what we had was excellent. \u00a0Because it was so good we returned a few nights later for another dinner. \u00a0We ate fairly early, definitely by European standards, having left our cruise ship early that morning and having had only a light lunch. The restaurant was virtually empty when we arrived at about 6. We ordered sangria and the amazingly delicious \"Spanish bread\" which was flavored w/ thin tomato sauce, olive oil and a little salt. The bread was 5 Euros for both of us. We weren't told the price, but then we didn't ask. I thought it was worth it. I ordered a salad and Alan ordered an eggplant appetizer. Both were flavorful and generously proportioned enough that we could have split either and been satisfied. We both ordered paella and again, we could have split that. Mine was mixta, w/ mussels, chicken, and chunks of squid mixed w/ the rice, peas and green beans. Alan had the fisherman's style. He is more the paella aficionado and thought it was good but not great. We also ordered grilled vegetables, which was complete overkill. Needless to say, most of our dishes went unfinished. But what we ate, was very good and the sangria was fabulous. \u00a0When we returned for dinner we had a better sense of what portion sizes were like and ordered more moderately. \u00a0Again it was delicious. \u00a0The decor was attractive, w/ interesting stone walls offering an appealing texture visually. \u00a0Tables lined the sides of the restaurant and there was outside seating, although it was too chilly in April for us to be interested in it at dinner. \u00a0Service was warm and welcoming.",
