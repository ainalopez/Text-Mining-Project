    "We had a few meals at Rekons and every time we were more keen to go back there. Very busy with high table turnover with very efficient and helpful service. \u00a0The ambience and atmosphere were very relaxing and all the meals so delicious like homemade. Full satisfaction for body and mind! Thank you!!",
