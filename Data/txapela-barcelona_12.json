    "The best tapas I ate in Spain. La Latina part of Madrid was quite overrated and I told myself that I dislike tapas until I came here. Tapas here are affordable and high quality. I ordered 18 tapas (11 I took home) and 1 cup of wine for ~37 euros. That's cheap...but very delicious! Madrid your food sucks but Barcelona I love you for Gaudi and Tapas!To top that the service was friendly and attentive...the best I've received from anyone including the hotel staff!",
