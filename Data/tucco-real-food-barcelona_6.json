    "I was expecting a fabulous (by Barcelona standards, of course) seeing all these 5 start reviews. Yeah, I know sometimes you're in vacation mood, everything is wonderful and even the food tastes better than it really does. Maybe that's the case here.The place is cute and promising, good, inexpensive Italian food. My pasta tasted kind of bland, even though there's a lot of cheese. My wife's lasagna really wasn't very good - I couldn't taste the meat or cheese. I took a bottle of their home brand Sangria in a bottle and it tasted of medicine. They have dessert for every meal, but even that was just ordinary. \u00a0Maybe we're spoiled. I don't know.",
