    "This place has great food for a great price. \u00a0We order the specialty spaghetti which was spinach pasta with veggies and chicken with a delicious butter sauce. \u00a0We also ordered some empanadas which were delicious. \u00a0My mom makes great crane empanadas since we are from Paraguay and my boyfriend said he carne ones were similar to my mom's. \u00a0I tried the jam\u00f3n, queso,and olives, and it was really good. \u00a0Every meal comes with bread, a drink,and dessert. \u00a0I got the tiramisu and my boyfriend got the cheesecake. \u00a0Both were really good. \u00a0I recommend coming here. \u00a0Great food for a really good price!",
