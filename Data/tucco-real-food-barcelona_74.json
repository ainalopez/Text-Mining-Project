    "We ate at this restaurant twice while in Barcelona, it was that good! The pasta is handmade and some of the best I have had. The lasagna is great and so is bolognese! The empanadas starter is great too and all of the food is reasonably priced. It gets packed with a line out the door so Coke early! Great friendly staff too. I cannot say enough great things.",
