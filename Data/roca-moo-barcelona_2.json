    "Wow, this is what living is all about folks. We made reservations for Roca Moo so that we could visit during our vacation that included a stay in Barcelona. We were not disappointed. The food and the service blew us away. We chose the tasting menu with the wine pairing and delighted in the variety of the courses and perfectly paired wine. Maybe 6 courses? I lost count.The service was impeccable. They were attentive but not hovering and were there to move us to the next course with perfect timing.Go visit this one Michelin starred restaurant.",
