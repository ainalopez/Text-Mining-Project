    "Americans shouldn't eat burgers outside of America. We have too high expectations and standards when it comes to a good ol' burger. This place is attractive with a long line, guaranteed fresh beef, and homemade sauces. You also bubble in what burger you want, type of sauces & extras, and the type of potato sides you'd like. \u00a0 We waited about 45 min in total from end of line to getting our food. Not worth the wait..The burger itself was good, pink tinged inside and charred on the outside. The classic white bun is too thick in my opinion, too much bun to meat ratio.The French fries were mediocre, too well done and not fluffy enough. Note to self: do not try a burger spot just out of curiosity- better to stick with the food specialty of the country.",
