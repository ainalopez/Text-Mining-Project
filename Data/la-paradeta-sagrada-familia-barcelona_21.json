    "Even though it is located in the tourist trap neighborhood behind The Sagrada Familia, this restaurant is well worth a trip for lunch. The service was not fast, but that shouldn't be surprising for a restaurant in Spain. Picking your own seafood is way more fun than reading off a menu. The staff speaks English and is helpful. We went with the grilled langoustines (delicious), fried gobi fish (highly recommend), monkfish soup (not great), mussels in tomato sauce (yum - especially if you have bread to dip). Would highly recommend!",
