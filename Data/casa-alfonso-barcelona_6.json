    "We were a party of 6 and the service seemed to start off okay, but then our server brought out orders we did not order and insisted we did. Next, she got all our orders mixed up and then completely ignored us. Also, when we ordered we pointed to exactly what we wanted, so there should have been no mistakes. I'll give two stars because another server says they will take off a meal that we didn't order and the risotto was pretty good.",
