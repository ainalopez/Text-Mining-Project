    "I've read so many great reviews about this place but sadly, I was very disappointed. \u00a0We went mid-day and ordered hot tapas straight off the menu (rather than getting what was there along the bar ready to go). \u00a0I had hoped it would be better since the items we requested were made to order. \u00a0The bacon covered dates were overcooked, to the point that they actually taste burnt. \u00a0The shrimp was the only semi-decent dish. \u00a0Nothing else was memorable or worth noting.The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because the waiters were very nice. \u00a0Unfortunately the food didn't cut it at all though. \u00a0Maybe there was so much hype they don't feel the need to invest as much into their food now? \u00a0Who knows :(",
