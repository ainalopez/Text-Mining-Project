    "I have been to Picnic several times. Every breakfast/meal/coffee here is a pleasant experience. Food is tasty and different. \u00a0They also have interesting cocktails. Waiters are nice with you. \u00a0The place is small so sometimes you have to wait to be seated. \u00a0Anyway it is totally recommended!",
