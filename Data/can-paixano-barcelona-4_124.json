    "This place is amazing! \u00a0It's packed but once you get to a counter and grab the waiters attention order away. \u00a0Get a bottle of wine and a plate of their delicious sausage. I missed the liver stuff but the rest of the food I are was good. The best part of this place was the damn price. I got out with wifey spending only 8,35 euros. Wine, bread, meat...what a deal!!!",
