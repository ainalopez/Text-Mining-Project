    "I was in Barcelona for only a week, and still had to go here twice. \u00a0 Fortunately it was right underneath the hotel I stayed at, so I had no trouble finding it the first time. \u00a0The second time I simple realized I couldn't comprehend going anywhere else on my last night there.Tiny place, intimate atmosphere (and then some) and delicious tapas. \u00a0 Not sure anything else need be said.",
