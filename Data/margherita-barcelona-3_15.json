    "By far the best food that we have had in Barca! Fresh food, generous portions (3 of us shared a ceasar salad) and attentive staff. Beautiful decor, very New York City chic! \u00a0Alberto took care of our every need and Andrea stopped by to make sure that we were happy. A must for any out of towners who don't know where to go given all of the options.So we enjoyed so much that we came back two days later....the food was amazing, but the service? Hands down the best service in Barca!",
