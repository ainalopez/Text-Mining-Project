    "My favorite restaurant in Barcelona! The best blackberry mojitos. Excellent tempura prawns, grilled octopus, and tuna. The paella is absolutely delicious, so if you're looking for the real deal, come here. Finish with the cookie! Make reservations if you're planning on coming past 8. Highly recommended!",
