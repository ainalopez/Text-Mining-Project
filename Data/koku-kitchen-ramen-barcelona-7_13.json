    "A couple of friends and I came here in search of good ramen and were not disappointed. Out of our ramen choices, the vegetarian ramen was BY FAR the best! Delicious and savory and awesome. The only reason that I feel I can't give five stars is because one of my companions - quite the connoisseur of ramen if I must say - got the miso ramen and said that it could have been more awesome. Still definitely worth the visit; ambiance as fun and trendy. Delicious!!",
