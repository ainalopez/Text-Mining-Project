    "Great beer, amazing tapas, and friendly service. The atmosphere is intimate and genuine as are the three or so men that staff the place and tend to you promptly as to not want you to go thirsty or hungry. We had the the following:Patatas Bravas: A generous portion of oven roasted potatoes with the very hot brava sauce poured over the center of the plate for you to dip your potatoes so you can determine how much heat you would like. This method also keeps the potatoes from getting soggy. I was blown away at first bite. An excellent accompaniment to their in-house beer. Manchego cheese: Nothing special to add. Quality manchego sliced to order. Pinchitos de chorizo: Deep fried to order and oh so soft and succulent. \u00a0Great beer food as well. My wife and I ordered four pinchitos to share and then had to order a second round as I needed some more of that hot pork goodness in my mouth. Beer: Beer was very good and refreshing. Crisp with body without being too heavy. I wish I took tasting notes to share but I think it was quite similar to the ubiquitous Estrella Damn.It was absolutely one of my favorite experiences in Barcelona, food or otherwise, and was trying to make time to revisit but couldn't unfortunately. If I ever find myself in Barcelona again this will be my first stop for sure.",
