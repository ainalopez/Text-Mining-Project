    "We ate there last night and was suitably impressed. The staff provided an english menu and was quite attentive. \u00a0The one complaint I had was the portions were too large. We each had the veil steak, and could have shared one portion. Typical for an argentine restaurant. Same way in BA. \u00a0Empanadas for a starter were great. Plan on returning.",
