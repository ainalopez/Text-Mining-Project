    "The appetizer of the duck (rotillo de pato)... sooooo good. \u00a0I looked over the online menu, and it's not there, but it was a \"pato\" something or other. \u00a0I will get this every time i see it on the menu. \u00a0We ate outside on the terrazza, so the inside noise level wasn't an issue. but the decor was stunning. The wine list had some good options, the salad we got was very good (ensalada verde q'tq verde), same with the chicken fajitas. \u00a0mmmm.... ducki want to go back for more. \u00a0btw - I learned something new: \u00a0the \"q'tq\" abbreviation means que te quiere, or something like that. \u00a0so the green salad called ensalada verde q'tq verde is basically a green salad for those who like green salad... i'm getting to know some of the local lingo (yay).",
