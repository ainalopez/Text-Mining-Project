    "Outstanding meal. First we had the sardines and the squid ink croquettes. \u00a0Then we followed up with the tuna tartare and the mushrooms (with strawberries and wasabi - out there, but stunning). \u00a0Finished off with the pork and the artichokes. \u00a0Nothing I would not order again in a hearbeat.",
