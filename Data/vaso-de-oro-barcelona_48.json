    "I had to yelp about this place as soon as I found out the existence of Yelp Espa\u00f1a. This is one of the best tapas bars I've ever been!!! Excelentes tapas!! Me molan muchoooooo!!!! Located in the less touristy area of Barceloneta district, this noisy, small, and bustling tapas bar is one of my favorite places in Barcelona. \u00a0My favorites are foie a la plancha and diced steak!! Ay que ricoooooo!!!!! It's slightly more expensive than average tapas bar but so worth it. 5 estrellas!!!! P.S.- There are no tables, and the bar is packed! Chances are you will be elbowing your neighbor.",
