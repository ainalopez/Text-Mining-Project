    "Fried Camembert is the bomb. We ordered the 19 euro menu because we were starving and could not decide what to get, which is a mistake. The menu is varied and enticing. There are two tapas places down the street half a block west which actually draw huge crowds of locals but it was impossible to get tables (or breathing room). This place is a good alternative. It's more tourists but everything was are was delicious.",
