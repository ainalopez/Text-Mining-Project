    "The best spot for fresh delicious food! \u00a0The owner is really nice and his attention to detail in the presentation of his food is spectacular! \u00a0You see a Rainbow of Colors and it tastes even better than it looks ;) We've been here for dinner 6 nights of our trip in Barcelona. \u00a0Love this place! \u00a0Best Vegan carrot cake, hell, best carrot cake I've ever had! \u00a0Gonna miss this place!",
