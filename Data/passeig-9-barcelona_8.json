    "While wandering the Rambla Poblenou, we happened upon Passeig 9 and after perusing their menu decided to give it a try. \u00a0We decided to have their Paella Valenciana along with pan con tomate, a bottle of wine and two dessert plates. \u00a0The paella had a nice, zesty balance of spices and was quite tasty, though some pieces of the meats required a bit of dissection to remove gristle. \u00a0 We ended up spending 57E and while that may have been a bit high, we were very full and quite satisfied upon heading to our hotel, so we felt we got most of our money's worth.",
