They have individual tapis pieces on sliced French bread for 1 euro each. They count the toothpicks to charge. Selections include salmon on avocado with a dollop of caviar, mossierello and tomato, \u00a0calimari, sausage, etc. all for one euro. \u00a0Selections were both hot and cold with the hot pieces going into the microwave.
