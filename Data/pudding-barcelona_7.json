    "4.5This place is magical. No, really - it is!It looks like you walk into Alice's wonderful garden of peculiar things. No, thats not an actual place in the movie but you'll understand once you enter this shop!We walked in on a weekday afternoon and the place was pretty packed, luckily, we were able to grab a table without a wait.We ordered two coffees (a soy cappuccino & an affogato) and a cheesecake to share.I kinda wish we wouldn't have shared. The cheesecake was pure joy. Deliciously creamy with a perfect crust. No description can ever do it justice - just order it!My soy cappuccino was delicious and the affogato seemed pretty good as well.Prices were reasonable. Service was fast but not too friendly. The waiter was not super rude, but he just didnt seem to be happy to be there. Perhaps it was a bad day for him? No biggie!If you are in town, and you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, definitely give this place a shot! And dont share dessert. Trust me on that one.",
