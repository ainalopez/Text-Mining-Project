    "I love La Principal. \u00a0It's a special place: one for meeting old friends, taking a date, or passing a quiet Sunday afternoon alone. \u00a0WIth huge doors opening up onto Pla\u00e7a de Goya, La Principal is a bar of and for encounters; a border crossing between Eixample and El Raval. \u00a0The drinks are great, the staff quick and friendly, and the atmosphere enchanting. \u00a0Rain or shine, be sure to grab one of the copious tables along the sidewalk: the ideal spot to people watch and while away the hours.I come here a lot, and generally stick to liquids, but did enjoy a relatively delicious brownie the last time I was here. \u00a0That said, they've a huge selection of various tapas available for consumption: a pretty sweet deal!If you're in the area, need a coffee or a drink, and love to do the above in a truly charming, open, friendly atmosphere, La Principal is the perfect spot for you! \u00a0Enjoy!",
