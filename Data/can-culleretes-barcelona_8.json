    "While my husband and I were in Barcelona, we wanted to enjoy some traditional Catalan cuisine. We were told this was the spot. We arrived just before the doors opened for lunch and there was a line of people waiting to get in. A good sign, I suppose. It's a large restaurant, so we were seated almost immediately once the doors opened. The couple next to us quickly figured out we were tourists and engaged us in conversation. He was excited to see us in here because apparently this is where the locals go. Excellent. I wish we could have talked more, but my Spanish is not up to par.It was menu del dia time! Fish soup for me, canelones for my husband, and we went crazy and got veal stew and the pig trotter stew as the entree. Lots of wine to drink (of course). The first course was excellent. We should talk sometime about how much I love canelones. I'm thinking we went a little too experimental for the second course. The stews were both good but kind of similar to each other and pigs trotters are fattier than I thought. So the second course was good but not great. Dessert was chocolate cake for my husband and a whiskey tart for me. Both were quality, but I preferred the whiskey tart.Prices were very good, but the service was slow at times (particularly at the end, as our server disappeared for half an hour before we got our check). Definitely worth checking out. If I was to come back, I'd eat that fried calamari the couple next to us got. It looked awesome.",
