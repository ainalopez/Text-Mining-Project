    "Ate here twice, first time had a chicken sandwich to go. Second time had a mixed plate of chicken and beef. Both are a great value for your money! Best place I've eaten in Barcelona. They are generous with the portions of meat and tastes great! Only downside is the wait, but go during off-peak times... Extremely friendly staff. Will definitely stop here next time I'm in Barcelona! Also since seating is limited perfect to take away and go sit by beach or harbor with a litro from either of the 2 markets close by.",
