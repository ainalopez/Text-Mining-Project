    "Another one of my favorite Barcelona finds, 2 slices of pizza and a beverage for 4\u20ac. It's not New York Pizza by any stretch of the imagination, but mighty fine in it's own right. \u00a0The crust is light and flaky with good toppings--Catalans can do cheese and produce well. \u00a0(Okay, I think the owners are Argentinians, but the cheese and produce are local.)I am fond of the spinach and mushroom (well, ANYTHING with local mushrooms on it is good.) types, though my carnivore friends seem more than happy with the meat fare.This place keeps my wallet fat, but all the great pizza and temptation to go back several times a week is making the rest of me fat as well.",
