    "My dinner at McDonald's was better than my dinner here. So if you want something better (and cheaper) hit up McD's instead. Although the service was decent, the food itself was wayyyy subpar and disappointing. I also got pretty sick after eating the eel. The best thing I had there was the water and that's because they bought it instead of made it. Whomever said that this restaurant is good doesn't really appreciate and value food.",
