    "I've walked by many times and Vinitus seemed to always be bustling. Came for tapas one night with my mother and it was absolutely delicious! The service is amazing, all of the waiters are sweet and funny. The food is delicious, and not too pricey. I highly recommend the crunchy Camembert. Also they have plenty of seating so there's a good chance to get a table!",
