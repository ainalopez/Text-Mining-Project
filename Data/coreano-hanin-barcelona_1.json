    "Not many people were here when I got in on Sunday night. I can see couple of Koreans eating here so it might be pretty legit. It turned out that it was a pretty good place for kbbq. The quality of meat was really good and fresh. One thing I am a little bit disappointed was kimchi. Personally I believe I can get better kimchi from any supermarket.Price, eh.. Also a little bit expensive( or maybe I just have a big stomach). Anyway, this is definitely one of the best place for kbbq in Barcelona. And, don't let those top kbbq place back in U.S. spoiled you!",
