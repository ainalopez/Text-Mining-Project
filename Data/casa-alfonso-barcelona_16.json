    "Nice and friendly place, a little loud as everywhere in Spain but friendly waiters and good food. Nothing \"haute cuisine\" but who does expect this in this touristic area ? Normally I would give 4 stars but with view to the very negative comments from george k. I am giving another one. You must really behave ... How should I say ... as a ...don't dare....to have this feed back. As I said , nice Spanish cuisine, not to expensive.I had some \"pimientos\" some good cheese I could choose on my own and some good red wines ( Rioja Crianza by glass is good and cheap) . The waiters are friendly and open. I will come back.",
