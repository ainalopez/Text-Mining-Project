    "I loved this place during my recent visit to Barcelona! \u00a0I even went back a week later to try other menu items! \u00a0The staff is so helpful and friendly. \u00a0They all were able to assist me in English. \u00a0The Mojitos are delicious, as well as the Pisto vegetable dish, the nacho plate, and the chicken fingers. \u00a0This place puts their own personal touch on all the options. \u00a0After eating mostly ham, bread, and cheese all over Barcelona, I enjoyed a change at Palosanto. \u00a0Go enjoy a nice beverage and some tapas here!",
