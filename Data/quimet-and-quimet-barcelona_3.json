    "The is the most favorite bar in Barcelona. We arrived first 20 minutes before the open Saturday noon.But as soon as the bar opened, it became almost full.We ordered some popular seafood small sandwiches. I recommend salmon with cheese and honey, stuffed baby squid, urchin with anchovies and shrimps with caviars !!!! Every piece cost just 2.5euro.Unbelievably they were cheap!!!But I assure they're really fresh and tasty!!! It's worth visiting even though it's a bit far from the central and you might wait in a queue ; )",
