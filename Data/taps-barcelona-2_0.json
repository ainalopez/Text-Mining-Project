    "Amazing, friendly service & outstanding tapas. We started with sangria with cava (white wine) $13.50 a glass to share with a table of four, the perfect amount of sweetness to accompany the savory tapas to come.+ Pincho moruno (skewerrd diced pork)+ Estrellat (baked potatoes, eggs, onions, crispy ham) - my favorite!!!+ Tasting flowers (3 marmalade jams made w jasmine, rose, and lemon w vegetable thin chips and six large blocks of cheese of two varieties)+ Iberian ham and watermelon (beautiful presentation on top of sliced green watermelon and delicious & delicate/thin cold cut ham)+ snails in sauce (best version of what escargot should be. Large portions like at least 20 snails drenched in a wonderful garlic sauce with a bit of spice)+ Toast of escalivada, tuna, and anchovies (cold dish, precisely as described. One big toast with fresh tuna and real, fresh anchovies!! Also slices of tomatoes and two varieties of olives)+ grilled prawns (six large and fresh prawns grilled w nice garlic butter sauce perfect w a squeeze of lemon)Desserts+ Tiramisu (best I've ever had. Fresh fresh fresh and beautiful presentation)+ \"mato\" w lavender honey and walnuts (new to me and amazingly delicious, almost like cottage cheese texture. The honey is a winner)",
