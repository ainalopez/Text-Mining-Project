    "I want to be very clear about what this place is. \u00a0This is essentially a Spanish diner. \u00a0It serves diner food (of a Spanish variety) in a diner atmosphere. \u00a0It seemed like the clientele was mostly locals, tourists looking for the real thing (I was in that category), and young adults having a pre-bar or -club meal.Some of our dishes, the salads in particular, were nothing to write home about. \u00a0My girlfriend got the salmon entree, \u00a0which was on the special menu, and it was fantastic - super-fresh and perfectly cooked! \u00a0That dish gets 5 stars. \u00a0My Catalan white beans and sausage tasted good but possibly reheated.I think the moral of the story is, stick to the daily specials. \u00a0This is a fine, very down to earth (kind of divey) place for a cheap dinner and different atmosphere from most of what else I saw in Barcelona.",
