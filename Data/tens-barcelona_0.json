    "Glad I got to stop by this place. Came here for lunch and we got to sit outside. It was really nice! Michelin star rated so of course everything we ate was amazing. We had really amazing oysters ($6 each) but well worth it. Hamachi ceviche and it was so fresh! \u00a0Lobster and foie gras rice was also very tasty! Of course we had to order octopus too and it was awesome. Everything was very small so we didn't leave extremely full but it was a good amount.",
