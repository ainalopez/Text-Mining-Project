    "It's an ok restaurant. \u00a0Nothing super special about it, but the location is beautiful! \u00a0It is located in a square in front of a church. \u00a0It encompasses the idea of what lunch in Barcelona should be like. \u00a0Unfortunately there are a lot of shady characters that are looking for any opportunity to distract you and take anything you leave unprotected (phones, cameras, bags, etc.) so be careful if you decide to sit on the terrace (and I do suggest sitting on the terrace when the weather is nice).",
