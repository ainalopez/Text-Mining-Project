    "Came here on a lazy Saturday morning for a late breakfast. I wanted to avoid the busy, touristy places with a picture book for menus. This place was the perfect spot. Great ambiance, with soft Spanish music playing in the background, and an excellent menu. Definitely try the fresh juices and the warm sandwiches. I had the goat cheese, tapenade, and arugula. Amazing. Wash it down with the apple and ginger juice. If you are visiting from out of town, bring your ipad/mobile device, they offer Wi-fi as well. But don't be in too much of a rush, you'd definitely ruin the vibe.I will be coming here again and again.",
