    "Fantastic place! My husband and I recently visited Barcelona and received this recommendation from a friend. The place is intimate (only 6 tables, make sure to have reservation early in advance) but the atmosphere was very inviting. We were greeted with a glass of cava. I had the foie gras to start and my husband had the rice dish with lobster, for dinner I had the fish and my husband had the steak. The house red wine was a steal for \u20ac10 a bottle. Overall a great night! Hidden gem in Barcelona.",
