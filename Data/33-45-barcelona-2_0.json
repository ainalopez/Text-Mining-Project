    "This place was my go-to date spot in Barcelona. Such fond memories... there's a lively bar area in the front and a sometimes quieter, cozy area in the back with couches and chairs, great for lounging, chatting, getting up close and personal. There's wifi and an outlet or two, making it an ideal spot for working in a space that makes you feel like you're not really working. I may or may not have ordered a gin tonic and read finance textbooks here. It worked out well, I swear.",
