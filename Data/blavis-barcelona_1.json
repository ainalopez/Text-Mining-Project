    "Just to reconfirm what others have said before.Blavis is a little out of the way, but the care put into the selection of food (and wine) is second to none. Unpretentious, \u00a0hole-in-the-wall it may be, but the food is superb. We had a fabulous meal for two with 5 tapas choices, plus great wine and dessert for \u20ac80. It is becoming, \u00a0or has become, famous. Book well ahead! \u00a0Credit cards (master and visa) accepted.",
