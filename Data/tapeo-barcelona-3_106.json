    "So delicious! \u00a0First dinner in Barcelona did not disappoint at all. \u00a0We had the stuffed squid, snails Catalan style, canalones with mushrooms and pork, and the grilled asparagus and leeks. \u00a0Not sure where to begin. \u00a0The stuffed, grilled squid was my favorite for sure. \u00a0Fresh and simple. \u00a0The snails were good, but I prefer them the way the French do it with butter and garlic. \u00a0The asparagus and leeks were yummy. \u00a0Here's the kicker though, for dessert we shared a Catalan style bread pudding, which was more eggy and tasted like flan. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0But even better was the chocolate creme with salt and olive oil. \u00a0Hmmm, so good! \u00a0I highly recommend this place... It's about a block away from the Museo Picasso.",
