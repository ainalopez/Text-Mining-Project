    "We ordered a mixed paella which was very bad and I couldn't even eat it and my friend had a vegetarian paella which there was no vegetables in it! The food served cold and we asked them to change! The quality was very bad and we talked to their manager! To make it short, a very luxury and expensive restaurant with a very low quality of food which you will feel no respect to their costumers.It is not RECOMMENDED",
