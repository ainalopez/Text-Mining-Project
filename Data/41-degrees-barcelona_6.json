    "This experience was superb in every way! \u00a0Made reservations almost 2 months ago online, required to leave a 50 euro / person deposit. \u00a0Had a 7:30PM reservation, which is extremely early for Barcelona. \u00a0As soon as we walked in, staff was extremely welcoming and presented an aperol based cocktail to start. \u00a0They offered a wine pairing for dinner, but we opted for a bottle of wine (som was very helpful). \u00a0Each course was set out in various countries from Spain, Japan, Peru, Korea, Denmark, Russia and more. \u00a0Very thoughtful service and presentation. \u00a0Food was incredible (see pics of almost every course posted! \u00a0my husband thought it was a bit annoying). \u00a0Pricey but worth every penny... Took four hours to complete the entire meal.",
