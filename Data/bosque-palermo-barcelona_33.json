    "Before tonight, I was none too keen on paella. Clearly all other places have failed me.Casual atmosphere, standard service, and crazy low prices for all sorts of delicious food. The mixed paella was a little salty, but not overly so.They also have a mini Vienetta for under 3\u20ac, which was an unexpected and welcomed throwback to my childhood in the U.K.Recommended!",
