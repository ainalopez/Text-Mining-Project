    "If Ernest Hemingway was still alive and roaming the streets of Barcelona and found La Plata, it would be one of his favorites and I'm sure great writing material.I just happened to stumble upon La Plata while touring around with a friend/local of Barcelona, when I noticed La Plata from a short distance away. Before I even step foot inside, I could tell this place had simple and wonderful authentic Catalan experience written all over it. A small place, seemingly a perfect \"local/fishermans\" hangout, inside is warm and calm, and the options for eat and drink are simple, direct.\u20ac1 Wine in Tinto, Rosa, and Blanco (I recommend the Tinto), Pescaditos Fritos, and a very few other small dishes. Embrace the balmy Barcelonian evening and go here. Of all the places I noticed and visited, this was my sure favorite, largely because of it's warm and tucked away authentic atmosphere. Oh yea, and the great 1 euro wine. This place is the real deal.",
