    "I had dinner here and it was very good but not as amazing as the other reviews. \u00a0I did not come for their take away foods so I cannot speak to that, but coming from NYC and given the other great restaurants in the area, I don't know if I would necessarily come back. \u00a0I had the octopus and burrata. \u00a0Neither was anything special, but still had a nice dinner. \u00a0I had the lemon meringue pie for dessert which was ok, but I have had much better before. \u00a0Dry martini was the best part of this meal. \u00a0Was made perfectly!",
