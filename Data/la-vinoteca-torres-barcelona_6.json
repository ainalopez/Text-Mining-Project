    "My iPhone was stolen off of my table from a street beggar here. \u00a0He walked up to our outside table and showed us a paper with writing on it- covering my phone... when he left, my iPhone went with him. \u00a0Didn't realize until 2 minutes after he was gone.Lesson learned, don't keep your camera/phone/valuables on the table in front of you on the street in Barcelona (or Europe for that matter).Aside from that, good service- try the Eggs and sausage in a bowl... I forget the name of the dish. \u00a0Also, an impressive selection of wine.Staff apologized for the beggar but there was nothing they could do as their tables are directly on the sidewalk like all of the other cafes in Barcelona.",
