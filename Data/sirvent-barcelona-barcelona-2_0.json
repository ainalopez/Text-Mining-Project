    "Ok so since the other Sirvent (NO relation) had no horchata til March m. Wow! We stumbled upon this one. What a gem! A modern gem that is. The place is so cute. Total hipster style. I orders the grande and small oaxata. I really love the horchata here in Spain rather than my good ol LA (Mexican rice styles) here they use grain. I think it's so good. Total different taste. I wish I could take it home. But backing review. The place is HUGE. It was so good. The ice cream wasn't so bad either. The daughter got the cookies and cream. The cookie had a crunch to it. But that pretty much what we ordered. They also serve ice cream/gelato, horchata, sandwich, salad, cafe, other stuff which I'll post the menu. Parking on street and bike parking available. Two entrance and go down the hallway to this huge place. I think they also bake there bread there.",
