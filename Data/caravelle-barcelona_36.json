    "Came here for breakfast, had a chai latte that was both adorable and delicious; had the baked eggs which were the most delicious, cheesy eggs I've ever had! The chocolate banana bread accompanied by chocolate chip butter was moist and tasty too. We also had toast with plum jam but it was average. Service was really great and nice tunes were played. Fun decor and cozy vibes.",
