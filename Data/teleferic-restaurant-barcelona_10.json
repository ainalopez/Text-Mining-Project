    "Incredible meal!We yelped this restaurant and it had good reviews so we set out and walked there. \u00a0Great part of town and the restaurant itself is very nicely decorated. \u00a0Modern on one side and traditional on the the other. \u00a0We had the octopus with truffle sauce and it was \"to die for\"!!!!!! Everything was great there. \u00a0The service was exceptional as well. \u00a0We met one of the owners, Maria, and she was very nice and even spent time with us to tell us other places to go. \u00a0I would highly recommend this place!!!!!!",
