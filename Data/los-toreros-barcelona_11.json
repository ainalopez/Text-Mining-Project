    "Really enjoyed this place! Located just off Las Rablas, so didn't seem as touristy as many of those tapas bars. It also has a traditional feel. The restaurant is great for groups of all size. We ordered patatas bravas, croquetas de pollo, pinchos (pork), chorocitos diablo and calamari. All of the dishes were very good! After five dishes split between two people, we were stuffed. My personal favorites were: patatas bravas, chorocitos diablo and pinchos. My girlfriend enjoyed: patatas bravas, chicken croquetes, and calamari.We also ordered 1L of the red wine sangria which was good and strong. This was one of our favorite meals in Barcelona! Strongly recommend this place. We for sure will be back next time we are in Barcelona.",
