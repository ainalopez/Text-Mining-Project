    "I absolutely loved eating here! It's a small restaurant that's easy to find due to the long line of people waiting to get in. There was even a man standing at the door, regulating how many people enter the restaurant at a time. You know it has to be good with that many people!I loved this place because the food was delicious. I'd gotten a hamburger and my friends and I shared some of their croquettes. I loved the food so much that I was sad when I was finished! It was absolutely delicious! We'd also gotten a bottle of their cava--so good! I could definitely see why the place was so crowded.Actually, the only thing I didn't like was how jam-packed the restaurant was. It's understandable because of how popular they are, but it's so hard to move around and find a place there. It feels like being in a can of sardines.But overall, I really enjoyed eating here. I would definitely go back. I wouldn't mind enduring the crowd again just because the food was that good!",
