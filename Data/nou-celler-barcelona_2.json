    "great sangria, great Catalan chicken and sausage! the waiter was so friendly. they brought the tapas out in courses which was so nice. we sat there for hours drinking and eating and they have A/C! it's a heat wave in spain so it was an added bonus. highly recommend. i see negative review about their seafood. i didn't try any. i don't like seafood.",
