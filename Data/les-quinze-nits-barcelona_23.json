    "We loved it. Best meal we had In Barcelona and we've been here six days. Squid rings (calamari) were tender with a crispy crust, my wife had the caprese salad and the mozzarella was soft and creamy. The lamb entree was so tender it fell off the bone and my hake dish was excellent. Great service, great out door location on Placa Reial where you could people watch. We're from the NY area and this meal was very affordable. 2 appetizers, drinks, 2 entrees, 1 dessert : 62 euros. Highly recommend it.",
