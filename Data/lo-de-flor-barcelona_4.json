    "As visitors to Barcelona, we would never have found Lo de Flor ourselves. A friend who lives in Barcelona brought us here for dinner. The three of us shared these dishes. * Stracciatella - 13.5EURDelicious burrata! Served with diced tomatoes and thin slices of three types of bread. * Mussels with garlic and tomatoes - 9EURAmong the sweetest and juiciest mussels I've had! * Asparagus with Bearnaise sauce and shaved parmesan - 9EUR* Beef tartare - 15EURServed with a small garden salad, mashed potatoes, and thin slices of bread. Service was great. All the ladies who worked here were very warm. I loved the rustic atmosphere of Lo de Flor and the decorative touches, such as the hand drawn menus, mason jars of dried flowers lining the dining room, and vintage scales with vegetables hanging from the ceiling.",
