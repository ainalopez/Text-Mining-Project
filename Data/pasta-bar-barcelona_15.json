    "Real food, pasta such as tagalatellie cooked perfect aldente with sauces to chooses from like bolgenese or carbonara, you can add shrimp and vegetables like broccoli and tomatoes. \u00a0Huge salads with non-iceberg lettuce, because that or rocket is all they serve in spain, and lots of cherry tomatoes. \u00a0Approximately 10 euro, sit down in minimalism or take to go. \u00a0Beats tapas that having been sitting out all day, hence \"fresh real food.\" \u00a0Better than Tucco which we also tried in same hood.
