    "I heart this place. \u00a0GREAT little tapas bar right on the edge of the square in front of the Cathedral de Barcelona. \u00a0Long and narrow, gets VERY crowded inside from 7:30 on. \u00a0But...they have a GREAT (albeit small) patio with Ferrara heaters. \u00a0Great place to enjoy a drink, people watch (you'll have ample ammunition there, I assure you), smoke a stogie, and sip on a libation.The tapas are VERY authentic (unlike some of the outrageously touristy places on La Rambla), somewhat reasonably priced, and very very good.This place has a lot going for it. \u00a0Gotta give it a major thumbs up.",
