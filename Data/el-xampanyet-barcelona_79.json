    "Delicious tapas - great staff. \u00a0This place was recommended to us and it was great. \u00a0We went for lunch and although it's very small got lucky with a table for two. \u00a0The staff was helpful and walked us through some menu questions as it's not in english - not an issue at all. \u00a0You can order tapas at the bar with some cava or sit at a table. \u00a0Very busy with locals and tourists as it's located on the same block as the Picasso Museum. \u00a0Every dish was better than the last - fried pork, sausage plate with chickpeas, grilled octopus, anchovies in vinegar - all amazing.",
