    "After a while looking in Yelp for the best reviewed sushi place in barcelona i decided that i was gonna eat in Kibuka, the place is loud, pricy and their portions are insanely small, i've been in japanese restaurants in all continents and what i can say about barcelona is: If this is what you call the best, you catalans have no idea what is sushi!To make it short: DON'T COME HERE IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD SUSHI!",
