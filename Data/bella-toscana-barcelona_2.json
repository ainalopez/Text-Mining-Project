    "We went to Bella Toscana due to good reviews on Yelp. Ideed the food was great, but the interior was not pleasant. It migth be that they are trying to redocorate - but still its not satisfying I think. So, Bella Toscana, if you plan to go anywhere near four star, please finish the job you have startet...After finish my views on interious, theese guys knows how to cook good and tasty food. We were a team of three persons. This evening going for paste. All where pleased with the serving.",
