    "Found this restaurant from yelp. There are a lot of review from yelper. I went to the restaurant on 6 p.m. Without reservation on Friday night and i am so lucky that they had a table for me because when I went out there were a long queues in front of the restaurant. Foods are good. Fresh ingredients, real great taste, i ordered rich man palle and monkfish plate. Rice taste so delicious which was different from what i ever had. Recommended for real Mediterranean taste.",
