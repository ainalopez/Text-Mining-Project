    "I gave this place five stars because as a tourist in a foreign land, it is hard to find a relatively inexpensive and tasty restaurant that you don't feel ripped off and that it is a waste of time. I had a very nice dining experience here. The waitress was very helpful and recommended the cheapest tasting menu option (5 courses for 38 euros) and there was a lot of flexibility with the menu. Also, she was honest about the wine selections and advised us to get glasses so we will have more variety since it was as cheap as getting the whole bottle. The wine was surprisingly cheap for such a nice restaurant, 2 bucks per cup. The egg souffle was easily the most impressive sish of the night, with a whole egg white being turned into a souffle and the egg yolk still runny and perfect with the potato cream sauce it was served with. The crab salad had a nice taste but was a tad too creamy for me. The cod fish with rice had a good balance of flavors, with the saltiness of the salt cod balanced by the sweetness of the peas. Have to say, i'm not a fan of salt cod though. Pigeon with ginger was perfectly cooked. The sweetbreads ha a nice molass sauce which really goes well with it, but I do think the texture of the thymus could be better hidden if the blocks were smaller. The dessert, a green tea infused vanilla ice cream with freshly chopped nuts, was divine. Not too sweet, and the nuts were crunchy and fragrant, which added to the aroma of the ice cream. In all, a very satisfying meal for the price. Was it a michelin star worthy place? No. But was it delicious and worth a visit? Yes.",
