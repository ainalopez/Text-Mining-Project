    "The bocadillos are better here than at most other places. I'm obsessed with jam\u00f3n so obviously that's my favorite one, but get with the Brie...SO GOOD! The fuet bocadillos are also very delicious!It's super convenient especially after climbing the huge hill on Baixada de la Gloria... Sometimes you need to refuel after that hill and there is no shame in that!I love that this place offers meals to take for a picnic in parc g\u00fcell. So cute and it's so fun to get it with cava and toast at the park with the incredible views of Barcelona! Don't forget dessert!!! It's sacrilege to skip dessert in the Iberian peninsula. So grab a pastry because, like everything else at this place, they are all pretty yummy!",
