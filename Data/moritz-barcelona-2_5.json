    "I believe the 3 star A-OK rating pretty much sums up my feelings about this brew pub. The beer is really delicious & although the menu is huge with multiple cuisines represented, the food we sampled was average. Unfortunately, when a restaurant tries to do too much, this is often the case. It's located in the University area, so this most likely appeals to many students. Prices are very reasonable, as well. My husband got a burger that was served so rare I'd have been frightened to eat it. Server nowhere in sight, so sending it back wasn't really an option. My Iberian ham & Brie pretzel sandwich was pretty tasty but my husband was done with his food before it arrived. The server apologized profusely for the error. As previously stated, the beer is really good. Go here for that & try to find something that appeals on the menu - it's easy to do. Just have realistic expectations on what will arrive.",
