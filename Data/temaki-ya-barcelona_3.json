    "Was probably a 4 star but saw sushi chef accept two used trays from a customer with lots of remnants of the customer's food on it. \u00a0Then he walked into the small kitchen and dumped the food in the garbage can in there. Then back to preparing raw sushi without changing gloves. \u00a0Yuck! \u00a03 guys, none japanese, made me a bit worried about cleanliness going in. \u00a0And they proved me right.On a positive note the sushi, danburi, egg rolls, and yakisoba were very good (maybe the extra flavoring from other customers' meals?). \u00a0Well flavored but a bit strange to us since it seemed like worchesteshire-like sauce was used instead of vinegar on the donburi and yakisoba. \u00a0Good but different. Sushi rolls were tasty even though the spicy roll was not spicy as advertised. \u00a0Would have been 4 or a bit higher rating if food handling was better...this is raw fish guys!",
