    "Do not be a fool and settle for touristy spots around Las Ramblas. \u00a0Make your way to the historic, cobblestone side streets bit too far away and you will be rewarded with some of the best pintxos in town. \u00a0So, if you're a virgin when it comes to this delightful Catalan tradition, the bar is filled with different types of \"pintxos\" - or bite sized servings of everything from tortilla espa\u00f1ola or jam\u00f3n iberico over a slice of delectable bread. \u00a0Order a \"ca\u00f1a\" (beer on tap) or a glass of wine and help yourself to what's already out on the bar, or exercise some patience and wait for the hot varieties that come out of the kitchen. \u00a0Croquettes filled with shrimp and spicy sausage called chistorra were some of our favorites. \u00a0Then at the end, the waitress will count the number of toothpicks you consumed as this would equal the number of pintxos you enjoyed. \u00a0But beware as your eyes might be bigger than your stomach! \u00a0After all, the idea is to have a few then move on to the next stop!",
