    "Very nice ambiance, and good service, near a busy area. The chef is very efficient, and flexible to provide anything the customer requests. \u00a0Rumor has it a location could be coming to San Francisco. Imagine that. Definitely get the sangria here. It is quite good, and the seafood paella is better than than others nearby. Although, only the seafood available on the day which may not include prawns, clams, or mussels. ;)",
