    "My wife and I went here for lunch. We were sold by the live seafood that was on display and jumping around outside the restaurant. We ordered the salmon and tuna salad (served with romaine hearts). The salmon was made gravlax style with dill and tuna was flaky with mayonnaise. This salad was very good and could easily fill one's stomach. We also ordered the seafood paella (min 2 person order). We were very disappointed with the paella considering it was 19 euros per person. The rice was semi hard and the sauce was very salty. The portion per person was very large and could have easily served 4 people instead of 2.We will never come back to this restaurant. The biggest reason is because the service was terrible. The waiters were very pushy and constantly harassed us for our order. The restaurant was practically empty when we sat down so the waiters may be just trying to over service but I had a poor impression of them. They served bread and added it to the bill without asking. The cost of the menu items should be rated 3 dollar signs instead of 2 and at the same time not worth the money.",
