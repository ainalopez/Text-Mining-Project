    "This place was recommended to me by someone living in Barcelona so it may have been good at one point but it really wasn't great when I went (8/14).The service was one of the worst I think I had between Spain and NYC - our waitress came over after about 15 mins and just looked at me - no hello, no greeting - and just expected me to order and then when I started ordering she walked away mid-sentence and came back about 10 mins later....The food was okay but not worth noting - we did get a creamy soup like dish but waited 15 mins for the bread we asked for to come so didn't get to enjoy that with our other dishes.The best part of the experience was people watching in the square.",
