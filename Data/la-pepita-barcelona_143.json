    "This is a great restaurant. I would argue this is the top of the tops for tapas. Do not eat here on your first night in Barcelona, as every night after will fall short unless you spend 3x the amount at a very fancy restaurant. Rather, I would say to eat at a regular place, then eat here. You will be shocked with the quality, the interesting take on traditional dishes (pumpkin gazpacho with sugar peas and ham).The pepitas are good, the tapas are GREAT.A reservation is recommended to get a table. Can usually sit at the bar, which works well for tapas though.",
