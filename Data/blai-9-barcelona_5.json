    "Lovely little place on Carrer Blai that proudly serves artistic pinchos (or pintxos). The people who run this place are really open to talking to non-locals and are more than happy to recommend other places in the area. \u00a0Pinchos tend to be cheaper than tapas, so it was definitely a pleasant surprise to know that the bites here were extremely affordable, about 1\u20ac and 1.5\u20ac depending on which plates you got.The pinchos with jam\u00f3n were in my opinion, the best. Other tapas weren't quite as good, but for that price - you're getting quite the bang out of your Euro.",
