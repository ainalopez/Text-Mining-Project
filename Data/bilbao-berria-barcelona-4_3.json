    "Talk about eating with your eyes first. When you first get here, there are rows and rows of tapas. You want to try them all because they are so pretty. But this place went beyond the mere meat or fish & cheese on bread. There were lots of those too though(and they were all delicious). Add fried chicken, paella, mini-burgers, varieties of skewered meats/cheese/veggies, clams and multiple desserts. Each tapa was a set price and they count up your skewers at the end of the meal. It was very crowded but we came here twice it was so good! The wait staff were gracious about our minimal Spanish speaking skills and were so nice to us.Bonus: tapas are great meals for Pescaterians (veggies & seafood only). One of my friends on the trip found lots of options here!",
