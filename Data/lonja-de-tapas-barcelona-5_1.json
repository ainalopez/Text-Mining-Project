    "We came here for a tapas dinner one night after visiting the Picasso Museum nearby. I have to agree that the prices are bit high for tapas but the quality of food is makes up for it. \u00a0We waited a while before our waitress to our table since they were short staffed before the peak dinner hour. \u00a0We ordered 4 tapas with the Catalan tomato bread. \u00a0The tuna was my favorite by far! \u00a0I loved the soy sauce dressing and the black sesame. \u00a0The ham croquettes were mostly potato with only bits of ham. \u00a0The tomato bread didn't only had specks of tomato on there compared to what we had the night before. \u00a0We mistakenly got the chicken nuggets instead of shrimp, but we did get the shrimp at the end. \u00a0The Camembert cheese was really delicious! The wine was very good as expected. \u00a0Overall, the food here was just OK...nothing to rave about. \u00a0The service could be more attentive as opposed to feeling rushed. You may want to choose another place if you're looking for authentic Spanish tapas.",
