    "This quite, small, unassuming place is a local craft beer bar at its finest. Rotating taps, local and imported craft and artisan beers. Good wide selection in place of the normal \"We have 8 different IPA's and only 1 other type of beer\". They also have real english ales (2 taps)I've found this place great for beer lovers to take both their friends who want to ease into the craft scene and veterans who aren't afraid to try different styles in one sitting.",
