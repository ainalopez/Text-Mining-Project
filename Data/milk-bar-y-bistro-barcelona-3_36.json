    "Ordered the pink lady dessert. Really good. The wifi works great here, too. They are friendly and efficient, especially the hostess/waitress. I got the \"pink flamenco\" drink. It was presented in an adorable jar and was really good - not too sweet or too bitter! More filling than I expected. Worth it! Also recommend coming by yourself; I did and didn't have to wait in the line. The hostess just sat me in an empty seat at the bar.",
