    "The service was a giant let down. We were asked by 4 different people if we wanted drinks to start (we ordered with the first person, so no idea why three more had to ask). We tried to order more sushi, but were told the wait would be another 30 as the sushi maker was backed up. We also asked for the dessert menu, which never came. My entire group spoke spanish (and some catalan), yet the staff were a disaster. The food was ok, with the beef with frio being the best thing we had. There were some good items, but also some fairly average ones, depending on your taste.It was really hard to find. Generally I would say don't avoid the place, but it may not be worth the hassle. The food was a mix between 3-5 stars, but the bad service was a 2 star job.",
