    "Clearly one of the best meals of our holiday...after enjoying a packed square of Castellers during a portion of Merc\u00e8 Festival 2010, we appreciated the ocean breeze and vibe of the setting.The only celebrities we observed in attendance, we shared a table with - our gracious hosts Jaume and Marta!The food - fabulous. We opted for the chef to make our decisions and we were not disappointed. As delicious as was the food, the dessert plate exceeded our expectations.As a total experience we were simply blown away. Catalan or at the very least, Spanish is recommended as this is pretty much a locals place.",
