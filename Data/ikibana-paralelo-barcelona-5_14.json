    "When you try this place you are going to wonder why they don't have like 700 reviews, because it is just an amazing dining experience!! Definitely a place to go in good company as you will want to enjoy the atmosphere and food together. I love that they have unique vegetarian and vegan options. The decor is so beautiful! Re coolest thing about this place is that they serve the actual wasabi plant (along with the usual ginger and wasabi paste alongside their sushi). The actual wasabi plant is something I've never seen or tried before and it was wonderful (by the way I hate wasabi paste, and this was great). The food is presented beautifully and this is a restaurant I would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona. Only downside is that I really don't like the neighborhood it's in.",
