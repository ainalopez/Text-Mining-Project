    "This was a delightful dinner: a combination of Argentine steak house and Italian trattoria! \u00a0The night began by being taken for a ride by our taxi driver, and then upon arrival learning that the restaurant was unaware of our reservation. \u00a0But everything worked out fine in the end.We started with an amuse bouche of breadsticks and a good hummus dip. \u00a0I followed this with an excellent lean Veal Carpaccio, and equally excellent Fried Provoleta Cheese with Serrano Ham. \u00a0I also sampled good and crisp homemade potato chips and sumptuous and moist Millefleur Potatoes that were rich and cheesy. \u00a0A \u00a0Filet was very tasty and \u00a0medium rare as ordered, but it could have used more Gorgonzola Sauce. \u00a0Offered rolls were cold and hard, but we were too full so didn't taste them. \u00a0Service was very good. \u00a0And the ambiance was sleek but cozy. \u00a0We each politely declined a complimentary shot at meal's end. \u00a0If I lived in Barcelona, I would surely eat here again. \u00a0And, if I return, I will remember this little place with a strong creative hand in the kitchen.4-1/2 stars overall!",
