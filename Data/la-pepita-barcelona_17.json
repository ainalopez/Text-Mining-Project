    "This is my 2nd trip to Barcelona and I have had my fair share of tapas. La Pepita was one of my top experiences. We ordered the sea bass with strawberries/basil and Burrata with roasted beets, watermelon, and arugula to start. Both were great but the burrata was top notch and refreshing on a hot summer's night. Then I had the traditional sausage and asparagus and my bf had the steak with foie. We both enjoyed our dishes but I wished I had ordered a fish dish instead. The traditional sausage is more like crispy fried pork... very heavy and a large dish.I had the wonderful rose wine and my bf had their bulldog gin and tonic. We were both satisfied with our drinks and the service was just right. Bartender was super helpful and had a great disposition. Cool dude.Expect to wait for a table. This place is worth it!",
