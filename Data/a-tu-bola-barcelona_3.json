    "Great little restaurant in Barcelona. If you can I'd sit by the door or at the back under the A/C. The menu is easy to understand with all the different ball options. I highly recommend the Mexican Pork with Fried Polenta and the Apple Coleslaw is a great accompaniment for any balls. Enjoy getting you lips around several different balls!!The staff were also very friendly and welcoming to us.",
