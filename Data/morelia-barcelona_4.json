    "Best recommendation ever! Our concierge told us about this place and we are so happy that he did. Their specialty is Argentinian steak, which was tender and delicious as were the empanadas. All the food we tried here was utterly delectable and our evening here was one of the best we had in Barcelona. We left feeling extremely happy and danced off on Food Cloud Nine. The service was also very friendly and warm too. This was a really satisfying and delicious meal and I would recommend this wholeheartedly.",
