    "First let me say that that the people that work there are the nicest and friendliest we encountered in Barcelona. \u00a0We visited a couple of times during our stay. \u00a0My boyfriend likes Martini's and they made the best. \u00a0Also during one of the visits I left my new tablet there and did not realize it for a while. \u00a0I had to back track to remember where I left it. \u00a0I came back they had it for me. Good people. Now, lets talk about the food. \u00a0Great, great and I mean great Tapas. \u00a0 Our last night we visited 8 tapas restaurants they had listed in a competion BCN, every restaurant offered their best tapas and a small beer for 2,50, it was so much fun! \u00a0You voted for your favorite Tapa. \u00a0I voted for La Bomba which is Palosanto's tapas. \u00a0My mouth waters when I think about it.",
