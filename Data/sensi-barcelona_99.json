    "This place is a gem in the Barri Gotic area! Place is so romantic, i liked the lighting and ambiance. The waiters were very helpful and accomodating to our questions. I'm not a big fan of the seafood paella here but it's good to try it. I loved the salmon burger, tuna tartare and the ravioli. Thumbs up!",
