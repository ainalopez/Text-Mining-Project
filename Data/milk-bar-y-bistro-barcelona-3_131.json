    "Great breakfast spot in the Gothic quarter. \u00a0The owners were friendly and helpful, and the food was fantastic. \u00a0My wife's eggs benedict were especially good. \u00a0My omelette was good too, but her's really showed how much better eggs are outside of the US. \u00a0So rich and a darker yellow yolk! \u00a0What do we do to ours? \u00a0I digress, Milk is a great spot for breakfast. \u00a0It still doesn't open that early. \u00a0If you have jet lag, and want breakfast at 7am, you'll have to wait! \u00a0Place doesn't open until 10, but it's totally worth it.",
