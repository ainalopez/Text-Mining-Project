    "After two months waiting we finally sat down and let us suggest from the lovely and attentive waiter different dishes. What a meal!! I loved everything, and tomorrow morning I will try to book another table to try the rest of the menu! It is not cheap, but it is an experience worth every cent. It is indeed the best restaurant in Barcelona.",
