    "If you love good food - Cal Pep is a must!!!Like other reviewers said, if you want to order from a menu specifically & don't want to wait for up to an hour then it's not for you. The waiter will ask if you have any allergies or specifications, they take the ordering from there. All the food is FRESH. Their specialties: egg omelette, tuna tartare, clams w an amazing broth w tiny jamon bits, saut\u00e9ed calamari w tiny jamon bits, tomato bread (Don't eat it all when they serve it so you can use it to soak up all the delicious sauces in each tapa), monkfish, cuttlefish *don't ask for aioli for your fried calamari like the \u00a0guy next to us- to TouristicaWine: cava is perfect & they serve an easy white for under $9 euro. Our total bill $96EU. 4 plates, 2 cava, 1 bottle of white. Yes we enjoyed;) We loved our dinner so much we went back for lunch the next day.",
