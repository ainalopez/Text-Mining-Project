    "A build-your-own burger place with plenty on the menu. Once you sit down, the staff bring you a piece of paper and a pen and you select the meat, bread, sauce & toppings you want. The fries are well salted, with a slight spicy kick (but not too much). If your a sauce lover, I would suggest getting two sauces, as the amount they give you only just got me through my burger & fries. The sections the build the burger were:- Fries, salad or no extras- Meat- bread- cheese- additional toppings- egg- sauce- sweet toppingsThere are a bunch of chef recommendations if you need help. My only criticism was that, while there was plenty of choice, the additional toppings section was very small (only around 7 items long, including 2 different types of tomato's). The place is stylishly decorated with a great feel to it. The staff were very friendly, but we were there on a Saturday for lunch, so it wasn't too busy.",
