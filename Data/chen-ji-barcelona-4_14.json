    "So after 2 weeks in Barcelona, I was craving some Chinese food. This place had good reviews so came here after visiting Sagranda Familia. I noticed most of the customers were non-Asian and eating the typical fried rice and noodles. Those dishes looked pretty good and seem like everyone had an order of fried dumplings which I also ordered. I also got 2 of my favorite dishes, homestyle tofu and smoke pork on tea leaves. The fried dumpling were quite good. I would come here just for those. The other two dishes were decent. If I was in New York, I wouldn't come back here for those dishes. But if you coming for just dumplings, fried rice, noodles, stir fry veggies, this place will do. Interesting note, It seems this area had a lot of Chinese own businesses, guess it's sort of a Chinatown.",
