    "We were looking for a good place to eat in Barcelona and thanks to online review websites, we found one!! It took us a while to get here from the metro station but so worth it. I realized that good places are usually away from tourist attractions and kind of hidden-takes some time to get to. Our first visit, we ordered the seafood paella and some house white. So good. The family next to us had steak and the dishes looked sooo good; too bad I don't eat red meat. We came back the next day for another meal and ordered the salmon entree and some steamed mussels (I think the boyfriend ordered a pork entree). Again, portions were generous and amazingly good. The restaurant is apparently doing so well that the owners kind of ignored a father and son that came in. They just kept on eating while the father and son waited for someone to serve them. Maybe the owners didn't see them:/ Anyways, prices are great and food is yummy. I highly recommend! My only regret was not being able to come back for another meal before we left Barcelona.",
