    "All I can say is some of the best food we had in Barcelona! What a gem! We made a reservation on the weekend and were sat promptly. The service was excellent, our waiter was so nice and happily explained anything that wasn't explained in our english version menu.The food were a bit larger than small plates, all excellent! The pumpkin soup was amazing with the added garnishes took it over the top. The steak melted in my mouth. Sophia, the owner came over and we chatted. We explained how we found the restaurant and she was so pleasant. She wrote us some other tapas and restaurants to try, her favorites and poured \u00a0a few shots of a spanish gasoline, as she called it. The service and friendliness was a bit surprisingly unexpected, considering all the other crap we put up with the prior 7 days in Spain. I highly recommend La Pepita to be on your top list to try in Barcelona!",
