    "This restaurant was amazing! The food was absolutely delicious, we got the quesadillas, tacos, guacamole and it was the perfect amount of food for a quick bite in between museums and sight seeing. I'm literally craving the tacos again today! Their margaritas were fabulous too :) the interior, decor and overall aesthetic of the restaurant was so cool! Will definitely be recommending this place to all of my friends",
