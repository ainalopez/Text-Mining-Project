    "The food here is super bland.I came here for lunch shortly after landing in Barcelona - so I was starving. Tried some sort of crepe with chicken and some dish with breaded chicken, an egg, and fries. \u00a0It was NOT good. I would give it 1 star but the coffee was actually decent and the service was pretty friendly.",
