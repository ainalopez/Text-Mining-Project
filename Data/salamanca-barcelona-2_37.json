    "three of us split the paella and it was very good - the best I have ever had. \u00a0 A drawback - it was pricey. \u00a0Some bread with tomato sauce on it was brought at the beginning of the meal. \u00a0Later we found that on the bill for ~8 euro. \u00a0Were they really going to serve that to someone else if we chose not to eat it? \u00a0The quality of the food saves Salamanca from a worse rating.",
