    "Down to earth, looked like a homey family owned joint.Husband and I came for late lunch and was plaza fly surprise by the pintxos selections.The fish ones were all delicious and the cured meat just as good.We also got some hot pintxos.The caramelized onion on the burger pintxo was deliciously flavorful.The best part and by far a yummy surprise was the pine apple desert.Fresh pineapple infused with lime, coconut and mint over a bed of ice.Incredible refreshing and hits the spot.Totally recommend saving some room for desert..!",
