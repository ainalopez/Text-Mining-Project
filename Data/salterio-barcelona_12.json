    "This is a great little gem hidden in the tiny tiny streets of El Gotico \u00a0thanks Jamie for bringing us here \u00a0and I must say that I'm not sure I'll be able to find it again. :-) The place is small \u00a020 people top \u00a0and run by a quite old woman from Sahara, if I remember correctly, and my understanding was that everything you eat here is homemade by her. I don't remember what I had but I remember distinctly that was awesome. Just try something out by yourself or ask, they'll explain to you (not sure they speak English though). It's no fast food here, you have to seat down, take your time, enjoy the atmosphere and the delicious food.",
