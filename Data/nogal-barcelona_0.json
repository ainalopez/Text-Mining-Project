    "Every dish is just plain amazing here! \u00a0We had the Ox tail stew, the paella with squid ink, the grill octopus, the razor clam. With a glass of red wine on the side, this is how a great vacation should felt like! \u00a0The service here are very friendly and warm. \u00a0We are so lucky to have Mrs. Zhang, one of the waitress who speaks Chinese to help m y fianc\u00e9e and I order the seasonal specialties. \u00a0Everything is so delicious and has the rich flavor from the northern Spain region. \u00a0This is a place not to be missed when you visit the famous Sagrada Familia! Also there is a generous discount offer if you make reservation online through TripAdvisor! :)",
