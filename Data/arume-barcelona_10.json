    "On our visit to Barcelona, we were very lucky to wine and dine in this fine establishment. Every dish that came out did not disappoint. 2 bottles of Rose, 2 bottles of Tempranillo, 4 appetizers to share, and 2 paellas to share, amongst 5 diners, was about 150 Euros! Do the math it was only about 30 Euros per person. And we were all very satisfied.For appetizers we ordered the steak tartare, shrimp, octopus, and goat cheese croquettas. The tartare was so flavorful, except I wish there was a yolk I could mix in myself. The octo was so tender and it came with some kind of avocado foam. The shrimp and croquettes were delish as well, they also brought out a basket of bread with olives and a cute vile of olive oil, clever.We also ordered a duck paellas and a seafood paella, both amazing, but I have to say that the duck was the most popular among our group of diners. One thing is, I wish I got more of the burnt rice on the bottom of pan, it was lacking. But not lacking of flavor, so good.The staff was very cheerful, attentive, and so nice. We did not order any dessert, although tempted, we had no room for another bite in our bellies. But staff was so sweet, they brought us a white chocolate liqueur to finish our meal.I hope to come back again, great job to the chef, cooks, and staff!P.S. It's hard to get them to answer the phone to make reservations, but try and try again. I finally got them on the phone after the 10th time, lol!",
