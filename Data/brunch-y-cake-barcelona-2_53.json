    "An average brunch spot with long waits, cramped space, lack luster coffee and no gluten free options. It is on a good corner location and perfect for people watching if that's what you are looking for. Feels young and trendy but overhyped. Probably the best items on the menu are their salads. Dogs are welcome so that's a mention worthy thumbs up for me. It's somewhat of a forgettable experience with more of these places popping up.",
