    "Yelp Barcelona is a very warm community and we were invited to join them in this place. Patatas bravas y cervezas with locals. Bueno!Homo Sibaris is not in a touristic neighbourhood so me and my fiance were the only guest who doesn't live in Barcelona. The bar looks very cool and hip and however the staff doesn't speak English much, they were very friendly. We got free patatas bravas bij every cerveza and Homo Sibaris has a lot of choice. I know \u00a0more about wine than beer so my fiance ordered a beer for me. He came back with a very strong and dark beer because he likes it. But this rookie beer drinker only drinks white beer....But I tried it and it was good! It was not so bitter than the Guiness beer. The patatas bravas were also good.We would like try more food and beer the next day..oh wait. That was our last night :-(! \u00a0Next time we come back to this place and in the meanwhile I should learn Spanish so I can order my white beer ;-).Hasta Luego!",
