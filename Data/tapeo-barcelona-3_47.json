    "I came to this place for lunch after visiting Museo del Picasso. It's right down the street in a charming cobblestone path! The interior is simple, modern, and chic. We ordered the pan con tomate, oxtail, and the black cuttlefish pasta.1. Pan con tomate- very little portion and pricy for what you get....although it's tasty. Skip it.2. Oxtail- good but wasn't fantastic...nothing to write home about3. Black cuttlefish pasta. Now this was great! Unique, flavorful, WRITE HOME ABOUT THIS! you get a pan full of black stuff, but don't let that discourage you, it's delicious! I think there's quid ink in it and that's why it's black. The pasta are thin noodles cut in little pieces, so you're scooping up the food to eat. The flakes of thin salt on top add a great flavor to it as well. MUST TRY!P.S. Get canas, great cheap beer!",
