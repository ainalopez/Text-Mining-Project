    "Old school, adorable, romantic and charming. It's one of those places that will transport you in time a bit.Modern cocktails and a willing to please staff. It's a favorite spot when I want a complicated alcoholic beverage or a beautiful atmosphere to write or visit with a friend.Also, they have power outlets next to almost every table, so for those of us with perpetually dying phones, it's a good place to recharge.Snacks from 2-8 euros or so, but made in house and nice; draft beer from about 2 euros, and fancy cocktails run about 8.",
