    "Stopped by after a great flamenco show down the street! Originally went next door to the pinchos bar but after feeling unsatisfied with the cold average tasting bites, I was drawn in by Lonja's menu.We probably would've gone for the tapas tasting menu (we ended up ordering 4 of the 6) but since we had a few pinchos each next door, we decided to just order less tapas individually.***Brava spicy potatoes - comes with two sauces drizzles on top..a white one and red spicy one. Very delicious and filling. Saw lots of people order this.***Tuna belly with green tomatoes, onions, olives and peppers - loved the tomatoes..tuna belly was okay. I thought it would be raw but it was cooked. For some reason, I think tuna tastes better raw.***Pimento peppers - my FAVORITE!! These peppers are not very spicy and extremely addicting.***Fried squid - expected calamari (does fried squid indicate something else in Spain?) but was more like grilled squid. Squid was very oily and slimy. Couldn't manage to finish this dish.***Catalan flatbread - not my favorite as the bread was very hard and not warm. The sauce, which is usually very good, didn't have much flavor at Lonja.The hostess at the front was so nice! Our waitress was also great. Everyone's English was decent..something I learned to appreciate traveling in Barcelona. The only thing that could've been better was they forgot our squid and it came after we finished everything else. I couldn't quite communicate to the waitress that we didn't want it anymore if they hadn't started cooking it. Overall, great tapas place with lots to sample! Just what we were looking for that night.",
