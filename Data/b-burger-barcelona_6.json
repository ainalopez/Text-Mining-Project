    "Found this place on yelp during my honeymoon as we wanted to try a burger in Spain. This place was in the area we were at. From the outside, it doesn't look like much. However the burger selection was excellent. Me and \u00a0my husband tried two different burgers and were both VERY pleased. Additionally, the owner has a lot of craft beers to try. If you are visiting or if you live in Barcelona, definitely stop by.",
