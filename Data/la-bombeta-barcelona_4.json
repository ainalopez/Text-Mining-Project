    "While I'm not the most superstitious person, sometimes the third time really is a charm. I was extremely hungry and wandering on my first night in Barcelona and had previously tried to get into two very packed spots for dinner. On my third try for hot spots yielded La Bombeta.Now, that is not to say that La Bombeta wasn't packed. It was. But, there was one spot open and I was dining solo, so luck was on my side. I sat down and quickly noticed that not a lick of English was being spoken. In that moment I knew I was where I needed to be.I immediately spied the bombas and patatas bravas. Everything was just working out perfectly and I made sure to order them along with bistec. All of the pictures of the bombas don't fully express the joy they were to eat. I just had a massive smile on my face as I was eating them. At that point my smile grew even more when I realized that I had patatas bravas right next to them on deck. Some people focus a lot on paella in Barca, me, patatas bravas were my calling. These were rocking and I was doing my best not to eat them too fast. I don't want to short change the bistec. It was just at the point I started eating my main entree that I was already a bit full. Good thing this was done beautifully so even though I was forcing it slightly, it was forcing through pleasure. The best part, was that all of this delicious food was less than \u20ac20. It felt like a steal. Who doesn't love to have a good meal at a good price? I'm not sure those people exist, and if they do, then they need to comes to La Bombeta to have their opinion changed.",
