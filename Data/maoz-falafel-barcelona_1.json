    "A Falafel Oddysey: What-U-See-U-Get!Briefly: If I run a falafel spot it is exactly like this place! For \u20ac 4.90 you get 5 freshly fried (not microwaved!!) homemade falafel balls that may seem to be a little small but they are really good as taste concerns. Guys at the bar put it in a pita bread offering you hummus and lettuce. That's all. The rest is up to you. You can stuff the bread with wide range of fresh vegetables, pickles, chutneys, vegan sauces, etc. The bar was so wide camera didn't even shoot it whole ,]5 stars and big thx ,]]",
