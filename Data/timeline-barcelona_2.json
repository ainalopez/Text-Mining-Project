    "If you're tired of the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas and the surrounding neighborhoods, head over to Gracia and you'll be more amongst locals. Timeline is a fantastic hole in the wall bar and restaurant. It's dark, cozy, and comfortable. The staff is friendly and helpful, the drinks are delicious, and the food is comforting. At night, the menu is a bit more tavern-style, with a handful of burgers (veg and non-veg), salads, sandwiches, and nachos. Two of my friends had turkey sandwiches, one had a bbq chicken sandwich, and I had the nachos supreme, with homemade veggie chili. Everything was filling and delish. Oh, and we split two pitchers of sangria. Do yourself a favor and get some of that ;) If you get bored while you wait for food and drinks, it appears that Timeline has some games tucked beneath the tables--we spotty jenga under ours!",
