    "Literally nothing bad to say. Went with 4 people total. Got 2 pitchers of sangria, bread, tuna croquettes, I got a pork dish, my friend got salmon, and then the 2 others both got a seafood noodle dish. THEN we got a Paella for 4. Way too much food, BUT it was so good we finished it all. Seriously the best meal I had in Barcelona and in a long time. The best part? That whole meal was 96 euros TOTAL. The huge salmon dish my friend got was 8 euros! In the US for that size and quality it would have been 20$ minimum. Highly recommend. Staff nice too.",
