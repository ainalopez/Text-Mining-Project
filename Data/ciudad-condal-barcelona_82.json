    "Great food. Great location. Restaurant is beautiful . \u00a0They have a tapas bar with amazing variety of local food. It's fun if u get a seat at the bar. Atmosphere is loud and everyone is happy.Unfortunately the crowds are ridiculous. So many tourists and not worth the wait. If you are lucky to get a seat at the bar you will have hoards of people standing behind you waiting for your seat or just waiting for any seat.",
