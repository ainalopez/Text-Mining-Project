    "The other reviews do not lie the food here is excellent. I am a tourist and I think I was the only English speaker here. Which is supposed to be a good sign. The food was simple but very flavorful. I got scrambled eggs with cheese, tomato and bacon. I was not disappointed in what was served to me. My girlfriend ate tortilla de pattatas, that she also loved. I'm very happy I looked up this placed on yelp before I went to eat this morning.",
