    "Everytime I review an Italian restaurant, I feel that I have to mention the fact that I've lived in Italy, and therefore 'know' real pizza. Most pizza places I've been to in other countries have been a complete disappointment, to the point that I pretty much avoid pizza anywhere other than Italy.Bella Napoli is different. The place is truly real, none of that fake Italian atmosphere. From the moment that you walk in, you feel as if you're in a trattoria in Naples. Newspaper cut outs of Maradona and pictures of famous football players (such as Messi) and other various celebrities hang on the walls, in true Italian fashion. The waiters greet you in Italian, and pretty much speak Italian to you throughout the whole meal- which I guess can be a bit confusing if you don't speak Italian, but definitely adds to the feel of being in Italy. Between themselves they speak in the Neapolitan dialect. The entire time you're at Bella Napoli, you forget that you are in fact, in Spain. Nothing about the place suggests that you are anywhere outside of Italy. The menu is \u00a0varied, with many different pizzas and pastas, as well as meat and fish dishes. The pizza is thick, juicy and delicious. One of the best pizzas I've ever had- and that's including Italy. If you're not a fan of pizza, literally everything else on the menu is delicious too.You can also get Bella Napoli pizza delivered to your home, through sites such as Just Eat, and Yes Delivery.",
