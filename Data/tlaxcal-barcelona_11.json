    "If I'm solely rating the food I would give it 4 stars but considering everything, 3 maximum. My friend and I arrived and I can't even say we were seated inside because we sat ourselves. The air-conditioning wasn't working and it was scorching. Call me what you want but I don't like eating in heat, especially spicy food like no way. That being said, we tried getting our waitress attention to move us outside but she payed us no mind. Sooner than later we realized that she was the only waitress for the entire restaurant. We then took it upon ourselves \u00a0to get up and move to the patio so we could breathe while eating. I ordered the green enchiladas and my friend ordered...I forgot. But hers wasn't nearly as good as mine. The sauce was spicy but not too salty. I also ordered the mango margarita and it was alright. I'm from Texas so maybe I'm biased because we have the best margs in the world. A few strong margaritas later I looked up and noticed we were the last ones standing. And THEN I saw a huge dog walking around inside while the crew cleaned up. How disgusting. Maybe I'm not so liberal after all because I gagged at the sight. Dogs do not belong in eating establishments like ew. Summary: Good food. Okay drinks. Bad service. Disgusting dog.",
