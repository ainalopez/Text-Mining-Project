    "Lots of variety! You get to design your own noodle or rice bowl, stating at 5\u20ac, and then add topping and sauces from there. Some of the toppings are more expensive, like meat, but the sauce is included in the base cost of the bowl. There were 5 different kinds of noodles (egg, udon, whole wheat, rice) and two different kinds of rices (white and brown). There were a bunch of different sauces (teriyaki, sweet and sour, peanut, etc.).",
