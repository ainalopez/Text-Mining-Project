    "I have mixed feelings about this place. \u00a0We went last night around 9pm and after waiting for 20 mins our group of 6 squeezed our way into the back.It is crowded and the menus are scattered on the walls, so, we sent one of our party up to the bar to order for everyone. \u00a0The Brut Natural was delicious and light and a bargain at 1.4 euro / glass though the glasses are definitely shallow and because of all of the jostling it was tough to keep from spilling some of the cava on the ground.We shared a bunch of ham sandwiches and hamburgers. \u00a0The bread was ok - not as amazing as I had expected and it was definitely dry so I found myself squirting on Can Paixano's sauce (a mystery red sauce that tasted very vinegary) to help make the sandwich less dry. \u00a0The ham itself was good and fatty and the amount you got for the price was indeed a good deal.The hamburger was not good - the meat was a bizarre texture and it was hard to tell what kind of meat it was. \u00a0The cheese was nicely melted but the combination of dry bread and mystery meat made it hard for me to really enjoy it.If you want a really cheap meal, good cheap Cava and a crowded but energetic environment then this is a place to stop by, but, I would avoid the burger.",
