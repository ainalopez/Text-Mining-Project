    "A very nice meal. \u00a0Paella was very good. \u00a0The wine prices were excellent (low) and they had much better wines than the surrounding tourist restaurants. \u00a0Restaurant looks very nice with white linens...it did lack music, but we played a French dinner music off our phone to make up for it. \u00a0Very glad we stumbled across this place...we're picky, and it was a good find!!! \u00a0Enjoy",
