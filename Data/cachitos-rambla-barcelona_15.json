    "Food was good, and the ambiance is pretty nice. The servers are nice but they could be more attentive to the tables. I went early in the evening which was around 7:30pm and there weren't many people there, and servers just seemed to be doing their own thing. Once we ordered, food was coming out at a great pace, just could have used a few extra drinks.",
