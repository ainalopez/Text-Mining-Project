    "Had the Hawaiian with some extra toppings. They forgot to put on my parmesan but so did i. Luckily 2 minutes later it was brought!The food is delicious, the pizzas are just excellent. I've never had a pizza which is that good.Dessert was a Panna Cotta with berries which was nice as well but lets be honest, you can't go wrong with a Panna Cotta.The staff was very attentive and made sure you have everything and are as comfortable as possible!",
