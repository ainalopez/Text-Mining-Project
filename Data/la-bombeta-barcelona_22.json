    "La Bombeta was the only shining moment of my otherwise terrible time in Barcelona. The tapas are all quality, but it's the potatas bravas and bombas (something like mashed potatas bravas) that stand out. The sauce used here is some of the best I've ever tasted! And the sangrias are mixed a tad strong, which is NOT a bad thing! :)",
