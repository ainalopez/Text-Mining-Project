    "Although we always try to eat like Europeans and eat local when we travel we were really just craving a large American type breakfast that morning. We found Milk on Yelp and it was a 15 minute walk from our hotel.The menu was exactly what we were looking for. We ordered Bloody Bellinis, the Eggs Benedict, and the french toast with greek yogurt. Everything was delicious and the portions were very large. It definitely hit the spot that morning. A must if you're jonesing some American eats or need a good hangover cure.",
