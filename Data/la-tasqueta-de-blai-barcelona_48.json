    "Of the many options on Blai, this is definitely one of the most economical. \u00a0Prices are VERY competitive. \u00a0It's cheap, and the food is pretty darned A-OK (hence the three stars!). \u00a0I love pintxos, and I love how exciting Blai can be in the evenings. \u00a0That said, Tasqueta de Blai is quite popular, and it's almost always filled to the brim. \u00a0That means that it might be hard to have a meaningful conversation with your fellow diners/drinkers: the noise level is quite loud, and if you're sitting along the bar, people regularly reach out in front, behind, above, and below you to grab pintxos and drinks. \u00a0Indeed, there's a bit of a risk of getting spilled on. \u00a0If you can, I recommend finding a table along the other side of the restaurant and then casually (and calmly) perusing the food options and then returning to your seat.Tasqueta de Blai is super cheap, clean, organized, and generally good. \u00a0Just be prepared to deal with the masses.",
