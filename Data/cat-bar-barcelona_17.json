    "My best friend and I came from Vancouver, BC CANADA for the Primavera 2014 festival and wanted something close to home with a Barcelona feel to hang out and eat in. Both of us are hipsters and we have a neighborhood in Vancouver called Commercial Drive. This place totally reminded me of an eatery that would be situated in that area. This place is vegan. Most vegan things are naturally gluten free, therefore, I was happy. My best friend was content with what they had. I think that he was just happy to eat since we were both hungry. It is a small place and it gets busy fast but we didn't have to wait. The lady at the til forgot about us, therefore, I had to go up and order for us. On the flip side our burgers came out in less than 10 minutes.The vegan burgers were nothing amazing and is something that I could get back home. We just needed something healthy and a change before continuing on our culinary adventure of Spain. Everyone there speaks 100% English and most of the customers are English speaking from the UK. Prices were very cheap at 8.50 euro for burger and fries.",
