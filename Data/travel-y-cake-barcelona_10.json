    "GOOD food, especially if you have a SWEET tooth (I'm more of a savoury person to be fair)loved the bagel with ham and cheese (my partner ordered it but I ate most of it lol) the turkey eggs benedict waffle was lush (only criticism a bit too sweet due to the sugar like nuggets on it) fresh orange juice nice, good service. On the second time I went I tried the Cronut (I was intrigued) didn't expect it served with a SYRINGE of sauce in the middle poking out (a bit off putting, lol!) unfortunately my sweet potato fries were nowhere to be seen (a mistake on the menu apparently) bit disappointing, after being told they were inside my bagel, before he fessed up, and out of ingredients for our smoothie of choice, a mixed bag, otherwise ok, would deffo come back here as great brunch, generally.",
