    "Food here was okay enough but seemed kind of average compared to most other meals we've had in Barca. The pork in adobo sauce especially was kind of dried out and didn't have much flavor. Was expecting the cod fritters to have more cod in them, they were nearly all filler. Sangria is made with Fanta lemon mixed with wine. Not a bad meal, but I'm unlikely to return.",
