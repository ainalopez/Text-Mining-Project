    "The setting is very old world (in a good way :-). \u00a0The main dining room is ringed by a narrow balcony that just fits tables for two and the artwork on the walls is really interesting. \u00a0We had a delicious fixed-price menu (\u20ac18) that included a bottle of wine. \u00a0We enjoyed the entrees very much -- great presentation as well as flavor. \u00a0They also easily accommodated a simple pasts dish for our daughter who isn't quite as adventurous. \u00a0I definitely recommend it!",
