    "Cinc Sentits provides a very unique, fine dining experience. \u00a0The restaurant itself is very clean, modern and quiet. \u00a0The service is amazing- owner/maitre D', Amelia Artal, was very welcoming and down to earth.Cinc Sentits gifted me with my first experience with molecular gastronomy. \u00a0 We decided to do the SENSACIONS menu, which originally consisted of 10 very creative courses, but I believe they added much more. \u00a0Each course was filled with so many surprises that excited all of my senses. \u00a0What an incredible ride! I can't stop raving about Cinc Sentits to my friends and family- I will be back!",
