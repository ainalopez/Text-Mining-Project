    "My sister and I came here around 8pm on a week night and had the best time. The tacos were AMAZING. Like I'd come back for more amazing. We had drinks and dessert...we only have dessert when we love the dinner. All was great. Service was great. It's just the way in Spain for service to be slower. But I don't think that's a bad thing at all.",
