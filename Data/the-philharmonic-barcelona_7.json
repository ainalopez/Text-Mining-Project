    "I live next to this bar and it's made my time here in Barcelona worth living. \u00a0I've gotten to know the people in this bar very well. \u00a0The bartender (Dan) is a really cool and personable guy and the woman running the bar (Jackie) is a real sweet heart and she really keeps the place alive. \u00a0You MUST try their hamburgers, they are just delicious. \u00a0They also play live Jazz music here which can bring in a nice crowd. \u00a0I've also watched many Barcelona soccer matches here which have made for some very good times. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place any night of the week. \u00a0P.S. \u00a0Don't forget to hit the late bar (Bagoa) just down the street to cap off your night. \u00a0It's a great way to end your night.",
