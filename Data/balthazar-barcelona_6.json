    "I ate here today with some friends for a menu del d\u00eda (9.40\u20ac) and it was quite good. It's quite a large place and seems popular but I'd never tried it before. There were 3 options for each course, all mainly Catalan or Mediterranean dishes. For me, I had a spinach \"cake\" to start, which was ok (it did have some sort of sauce - carrot?! - that went well with the freshly baked bread). My main was turkey (with a few cubes of fried potato and a relish-type sauce) and it was really good. I was impressed, especially considering that I was wary of trying the place. The dessert - for me, a slice of toffee cake - was delicious. The glass of wine was nice (and generous). Service was fine. All in all a good experience, especially for less than 10\u20ac. I've no idea what they charge for dinner... Oh, for visitors, the menu was written in Castellano and Catalan. I don't know if they have a couple of copies in English (doubtful) or how good the waiter's English is (probably fine).",
