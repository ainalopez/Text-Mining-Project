    "Super cute little restaurant! Don't let the entryway fool you. Most of the seating area is in the back or upstairs! THE FOOD:Potatoes: the fried potatoes are cooked well. It's got a little crunch but smooth and creamy! Topped with a tomato sauce and aioli, it's savory and comforting!Duck Cannoli: delicate dish filled with tender savory duck confit.Grilled octopus: cooked to perfection! It's tender and flavorful. It was a little salty but it could just be a one time mistake.Tuna tartar: fresh, delicious and delightful! The tuna tartar sits on top of a small bed of avocado and served with toasted bread.Nebraska Tataki with foie gras: this is as close to heaven as it gets!! The steak was seared to about medium rare. The foie gras added a buttery, savory bite to the dish.THE SERVICE:We had 3 waiter/waitresses working on a Saturday night. They were attentive and friendly, but having to run up/downstairs looked exhausting!",
