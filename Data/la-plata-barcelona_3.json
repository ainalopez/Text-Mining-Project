    "Located in the Gothic Quarter, La Plata is a small restaurant that serves a simple but clearly perfected menu: Fried smelt, anchovies and tomato bread, chorizon and a tomato, olive and onion salad. Everything was unbelievably fresh. The sound of fried smelt not might seem so appealing, but just one taste and you won't be able to stop. All of these plates go perfectly with the ros\u00e9 they serve.Not as cheap as pinchos, but so good and just so FRESH.",
