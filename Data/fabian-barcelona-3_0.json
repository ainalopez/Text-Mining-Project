    "First day in Barcelona & I wanted something different besides tapas. I checked on yelp for some ideas but I was in the mood for some pizza & came across Fabian.Perfect since this was walking distance from our hotel. We arrived & were seated right away the place was not crowded but as we dinned business did seemed to pick up.Small place rustic looking with seating upstairs as well. we were seated below. \u00a0I started my meal with a glass of white wine , good wine my friend stuck to beer.On the pizzas we tried the large size which is perfect specially since the pizzas are thin crust.We tried the Picante pizza ... Yummy this was delicious all the flavors mixed very well not super spicy but it does have a nice kick. Next was the grilled Chicken pizza , this was great as well good flavor with the caramelized onions which was surprising to me only because am not a huge onion fan but in this case it went well with the pizza. After our meal we managed to have some room for dessert, we tried the Mango Tiramisu this was good but it was more a like a mousse but it had a \u00a0great mango taste.Prices are decent , service was good this place turned out to be a great find.",
