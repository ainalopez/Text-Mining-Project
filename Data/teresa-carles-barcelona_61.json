    "This place is amazing. \u00a0Easily the best meal we had while in Barcelona--and no meat or seafood! \u00a0We had a big, multi-course leisurely lunch here. \u00a0The servers were wonderfully helpful and paced things beautifully so that we could imagine a mediterranean lifestyle where long leisurely lunches were the rule and ingredients were always fresh and healthy. \u00a0Lastly--the presentation was impeccable. \u00a0Even the one course that did not thrill my taste buds impressed my eyes.",
