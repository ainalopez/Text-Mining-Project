    "One of the best tapas restaurants we ate at in Barcelona, and we ate a lot while we were there. Every item was great. Their anchovies, boquerones, and foie gras dishes were some of our favorites. The dishes have a modern twist, compared to the typical Barcelona tapas spots. Family owned and operated, with extremely friendly service. Had great interactions the mother, daughter and uncle who own and work there. \u00a0Our meal ended with a gratis shot of a housemade digestif. Wish this place was in SF, as I would eat there every week.",
