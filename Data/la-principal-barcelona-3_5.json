    "Stopped in to watch the FC Barcelona game when we were traveling around Spain. \u00a0The 3 man staff was entertaining. \u00a0They created a great atmosphere even turning people away so it wasn't too crowded. \u00a0Local beer was reasonably priced and quite good. \u00a0Also had the best spicy potatoes!",
