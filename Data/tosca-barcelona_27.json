    "I can't speak for the food because after numerous attempts to get the attention of the waitresses and patiently waiting for 20 minutes to get someone over to our table, we had enough and left. \u00a0One of the waitresses that met my eye but proceeded to ignore us anyway all of a sudden now had an interest in us as we were putting on our jackets.
