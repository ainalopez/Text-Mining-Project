    "This is the more casual outpost of the phenomenal \"El Pla.\" It's so casual that you don't have to dress up and you can pretend it's \"just\" a tapas bar. But it's so much tastier than the others. I am thinking fondly about the fantastic iberico, wine, and salad. Deceptively simple food with so much deliciousness.",
