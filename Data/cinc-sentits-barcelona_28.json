    "A true dining experience. \u00a0Sleek dining area with great lighting. \u00a0Fantastic staff comfortable with English. \u00a0Presentation, flavor and ability to incorporate taste and texture was amazing. \u00a0Option for business lunch of 4 courses was more than enough for a 2 hour dining experience. \u00a0Noteworthy was the foie gras, scallops, scorpion fish done 2 ways and pork loin with poached shallot.",
