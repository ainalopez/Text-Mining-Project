    "Ambience: Quaint, rustic, cozy, plenty of space. Outlets near 3 or 4 tables (or the ones I could see) and WiFi!!!! Also, I like the big communal table.Service: Prompt and courteous. No complaints.Food: My friend got the patatas salvajes, (4 euros) which is pretty much patatas bravas, but I think the patatas are not fried. Rather, they're simply cooked in oil? Horrible description and guess haha. I liked the sauce. Cafe con leche was standard. Everyone around us was getting desserts, which severely tempted us.All in all, I will be back, perhaps to study or work on a project. Or just to eat haha.",
