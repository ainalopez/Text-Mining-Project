    "the short story: \u00a0a rock n roll tacqueria down in El Raval - featuring a full bar, heavy on the tequilas, and a few mexi dishes like quesadillas & tacos.the details: \u00a0I only wanted one taco. \u00a0yes, I know that tacos al carbon are small. yes, I only want one.the taco plate comes with 4 tacos for about 5 euros (4,50?)is there any way I can just order one taco? \u00a0I already ate - but I want to try one.fine. \u00a0I'll just have a tequila. \u00a0lots of tequila... but where's the Sauza Hornitos? \u00a0ugh... they have regular Sauza...fine - i'll just have the Herradura - silver. \u00a03,50. done. \u00a0smells like pee in there. \u00a0the music was fun. why can't i just order one taco a la carte?meanies. but you know, i'm getting desperate for my mexi-fix. \u00a0so far every \"Mexican\" joint in BCN has been a \"mexi-can't\"3 stars for the effort. \u00a0i'll amend the review once i actually have the food.(just a qualifying note: if this was in LA, it would barely get 1 star from me... but my star rating is based on a Barcelona curve...)",
