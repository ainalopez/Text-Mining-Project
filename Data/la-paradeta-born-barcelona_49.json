    "Perfect example of good food cooked simply. Something the Spanish have always done well and La Paradeta does very well!! \u00a0One of our must eat places when we're in Barca! For those complaining about waiting... You just don't get it. Be patient. At this place, good things come to those that wait! There's a reason the locals will line up to eat here.Must have is the razor clams and precebes if they're in season (& if you're game!)",
