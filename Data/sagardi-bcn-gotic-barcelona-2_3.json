    "Good pintxos which is a mild intro to the style for those who might be scared of going into a divier neighborhood joint. They have good cider and, if you come at the proper hour, everything is fresh (try between 7 and 9 PM), otherwise there is a risk of things sitting out there getting cold for a long time.Get a plate and just grab what you like! Finally, make sure to get the cider. The way they tap it is really fun to watch!",
