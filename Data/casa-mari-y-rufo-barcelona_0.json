    "When you look up definition for hole in the wall restaurant, no better place than Casa Mari y Rufo comes to mind ! Unpretentious, charming, authentic and simply more of these needed today ! We had a late lunch here in late October 2013 and despite the chaos, I assure you these folks know what they are doing. Food is simply divine and very affordable.We waited a good amount of time for our tables, but we were well taken care of with plenty of wine. Once seated, Mari (lady controlling everything) was very gracious and offered us drinks on the house. Food is sublime. I got greedy, as I usually do when I get excited in a restaurant, and so ordered a HUGE fried seafood platter ! oh dear, how simply freaking amazing it was. What appears to be chaos as you wait for your table and once seated, let me assure you these folks know what they are doing. And they are very charming and funny at it !Highly recommended !!!",
