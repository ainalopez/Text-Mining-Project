    "Definitely need to check this place out! We came for lunch, and it took us a while to get seated, definitely a popular destination not only for tourists but locals as well. You have to stand by the bar stools and watch out for your seat, there were 3 of us so it was harder to find seats together. We tried the seafood sampler and their signature dish -- the eggs with baby squid. The seafood platter was amazing! It had razor clams, shrimp, mussels... Oh my god! It was delish. The baby squid on the other hand though, didn't hit the spot at all. I thought it was a little bland, I'm not sure but that's one of their more popular dishes so we decided to try it. This was definitely a good experience, I love the workers, they were very enthusiastic! It is a little pricey though but worth it!",
