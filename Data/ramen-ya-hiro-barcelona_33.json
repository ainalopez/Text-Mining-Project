    "Japanese food has taken Barcelona by storm, and this place is, apparently, the \u00a0best for ramen in the city. \u00a0Indeed, the restaurant's reputation precedes it: Ramen Ya Hiro is small, and there is *always* a line to get in. \u00a0I spent a solid 30 minutes waiting for an outside table one recent chilly Spring evening. \u00a0The menu is simple, clear, and narrowly focused on that delicious, salty, meal-in-a-pot delight, ramen. \u00a0I had a soy ramen with strips of bamboo. \u00a0The broth was exceptionally flavorful, and the ramen noodles were delightfully cooked to perfection. \u00a0Indeed, this is quite authentic ramen. \u00a0My dinnermate chose a vegetarian ramen option not listed on the menu that, too, was quite flavorful, if a bit overseasoned.If I am ever in the mood for ramen in BCN, this is the place I will go. \u00a0Service was appropriate, friendly, and attentive, and the atmosphere is casual, if nothing particularly special. \u00a0Looking forward to another delicious meal at Ya Hiro!",
