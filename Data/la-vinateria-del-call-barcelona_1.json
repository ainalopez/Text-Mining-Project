    "We had a gorgeous meal here last night with 2 glasses of wine each and 5 tapas to share that we couldn't finish, all for \u20ac45. Very reasonable. 4 of the 5 tapas were to die for with the 5th - roasted veggies - being pretty uninspired. I was also disappointed to be served a flat glass of cava but changed to ros\u00e9 after which was lovely. The waiter was really helpful and the restaurant itself is lovely in the winding streets of the gothic quarter. Well worth a visit.",
