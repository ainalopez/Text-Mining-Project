    "Where do I even begin.We got reservations at Pakta a month before we were headed to Barcelona and it was sort of our end-of-vacation-final-tasty-meal. We wanted to get reservations at Tickets, but it was fully booked. Luckily, Pakta had just opened.The design and aesthetic of the interior is warm, darkly bright (?) and a great space for three hours of deliciousness.Just to give you an idea of what to expect, a direct quote from our waiter, when serving a dish:\"I have added a single drop of soy sauce. If you wish, you should another drop, just to taste.\"The servers are serious, but incredibly welcoming and friendly. There are gold flakes in one of the three desserts (no big deal, read: sarcasm).We tried the Fujiyama tasting menu (25 small courses) for 90\u20ac (VAT included). Don't be intimidated by the number of courses, individually they're smaller than any tapa you would have elsewhere in Barcelona. Wine was reasonably priced for such a high-end restaurant, but I guess that's Barcelona for 'ya. Everything was expertly timed and the portion sizes were perfect.Eat there if you're in Barcelona. Just eat there.By the way, one of us added another drop of soy sauce, the other didn't. I know, cliffhanger, right?",
