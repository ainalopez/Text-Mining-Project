    "My family and I went in here for a quick snack. We ordered the ham and melon appetizer and a shrimp salad. Both of the orders took nearly 40 minutes to get to our table. The ham and melon was alright, although the melon was a bit underripe. The salad was a mess. The shrimp was thawed frozen shrimp, which I didn't even think existed in Barcelona. The rest of the salad was some iceberg lettuce and some tomatoes. With drinks for five, this came to about 80 dollars.I hope we just came at a bad time, but boy, they dropped the ball on our meal.",
