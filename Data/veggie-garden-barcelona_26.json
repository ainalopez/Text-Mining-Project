    "The menu of the day - available on Saturday, too - was only 8.25Euros.That's a \"win\" in my book. \u00a0If the weather permits, and seating is available, grab a table on the patio - as the neighborhood of Raval is definitely something to soak up and enjoy. \u00a0Yet not to worry - if you don't get outdoor seating, the interior's riot of brightly painted murals echoes the energy of the barrio. \u00a0As for the food... I had a cold cucumber soup as a starter - flavorful and refreshing. \u00a0My entree was a vegan zucchini burger served with black rice and hummus on the side. \u00a0It was definitely filling. \u00a0The apple crumble for dessert was kinda 'meh'... but i never count on the desserts being all that spectacular at vegan joints. \u00a0My friend had the Thali for her entree - which I should have had - as I love cumin, and I could smell it from across the table. \u00a0totally jealous.I'm not the biggest fan of vegan food. \u00a0But they did a good job here. \u00a0In a city known for its jamon y queso, this place was a very welcome veggie oasis.",
