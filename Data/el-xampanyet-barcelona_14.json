    "Echoing most reviews, this is a good choice for tapas. They specialize in their small fish and some of their vegetables. I went for lunch at around 1pm and had no problem getting a small table. I ordered the anchovies, red peppers, sun dried tomatoes, and beef with peppers. The first three in particular were bursting with flavor. Can't complain.",
