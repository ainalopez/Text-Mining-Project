    "Loved that this place had a huge variety of food. The waiter was super nice and spoke english pretty well (even though he was convinced he could only speak a little english). We asked him for recommendations on what to order so he told us to get the fries with sunny side up egg (DELICIOUS) and a trio of appetizers, as well as a bottle of wine. We were both very stuffed and happy with the food. Though it says the place closes at 12AM, we actually left around 2:30AM, almost close to 3AM, so it was nice that they didn't kick us out. There were also a lot of other patrons at this place around that time.",
