    "I'll forever recommend this to friends visiting Barcelona. After being in Spain for a week we started to miss the Mexican food from home. We ordered the ceviche starter and arrachera steak. The food was delicious and flavorful. The guacamole, rice, and beans served with the meal were all amazing and flavorful. The house salsas are not that flavorful or spicey, but definitely better than what you get anywhere else. Our only downside was the slow service (they are very busy) and the lack of tortillas with our meal. I highly recommend getting a mojito, the bartender does not have a light hand.",
