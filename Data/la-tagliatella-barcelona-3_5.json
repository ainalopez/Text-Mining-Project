    "Our apartment was within a few blocks of this lovely restaurant, but I think it would be worth the trip even if you're staying closer to the heart of Barcelona. It's a large ristorante / pizzeria, with a varied pizza / pasta / entree menu, excellent food, excellent service, and friendly, welcoming owner / manager (not sure which) who was delighted to learn that we were visiting from Chicago, as he had lived and worked close to where we live.Excellent for kids, families, couples, groups, etc.",
