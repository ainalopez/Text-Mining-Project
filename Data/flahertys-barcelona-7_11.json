    "I was in Barcelona with my boyfriend and we came across this Irish Pub. It was the perfect place to get an evening drink at the end of a long day of touring! The bartender spoke English and we ordered a few beers. \u00a0The German beer on tap was lovely, and went down smoothly. \u00a0Free wifi in this place was a great help and if I stayed in Barcelona longer, I'd be sure to come back!",
