    "Amazing tapas! The best! You have to come here. The sangria is handmade and perfect (I watched the mujer make it herself). It's the perfect balance in flavors for sangria (not too sweet or wine heavy). You have to order the pork ribs with honey and the black f\u00edduea squid. Also order sangria bc they hand make it. It's amazing. Everything else is as well but make sure you order it.",
