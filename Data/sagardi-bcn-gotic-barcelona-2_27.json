    "This place was meh we came because it was supposedly noted for its pinxtos but I felt the selection was limited and the more tastier pinxtos were not replenished frequently enough. \u00a0We sat outside and the service was poor to mediocre. \u00a0As stated in the other reviews there are way better options in the area for price and selection. \u00a0The one positive was that all pinxtos were priced the same and you are charged by the number of tooth picks at the end of your meal. \u00a0I was with a group of friends and the challenge was who could eat the most and the number you finished on had to be a prime number (I know dorky but what do you expect for a bunch of software data guys) oh by the way I won 19 tooth picks",
