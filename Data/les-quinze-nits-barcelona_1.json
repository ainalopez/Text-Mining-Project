    "We were told by a souvenir shop keeper to come here for some of the best Spanish food in Barcelona. Was he right? Yea, partly.Les Quinze Nits is situated inside a very beautiful plaza in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Given its location, I expected prices to be higher with bustling activity throughout. The restaurant definitely felt much more upscale than a lot of other joints, and the wait staff definitely seemed impatient when we did not have our order ready.Eventually, we ordered a pitcher of sangria along with a mixed paella (9\u20ac a person), baby octopus appetizer, and eventually some desserts. The octopus was my favorite part of the meal. It wasn't overly salty and the bed of crisps gave it a nice crunch. As for the paella, I found it a bit too soggy for my taste, and not a whole lot of food for the amount that were paying. It was still edible and good, but not amazing.Both desserts that we ordered was okay. Nothing really outstanding to rave about, but a great pallet cleanser nonetheless.Overall, I think if you can snag a table outside, this restaurant would be worth the price paid. However, I'd try to look for other alternatives if you can, especially in spots that offer menu del dias so you get the most out of your euro.",
