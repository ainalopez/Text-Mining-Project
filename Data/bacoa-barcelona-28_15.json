    "4 stars.I've yet to find the holy grail of veggie burgers. This wasn't it. I mean it was good, yes, & I just might return to Kiosko for it, if I ever find myself in the Barceloneta area, but yeah, I can't say that I \"need\" to return to Kiosko for their veggie burger. Who goes to burger places for their veggie burger anyway, right? Maybe like 1 out of 15 people. So yeah, this review is just for the veggies out there, so for the majority of peeps, don't let this influence what might just turn out to be your best burger experience in the whole of Barcelona.I liked the energy of this place. It was full of people during lunch time, & I loved their black & red decor. Their bottled sauces were also pretty fantastic & nicely designed, including the packaging for the burgers (\"Burger Diario\", or Burger Newspaper).",
