    "Went here tonight for dinner and it was pretty good. Ordered a spicy tuna roll which was delish (but very spicy so watch out) and then miso ramen. The ramen was pretty good but could have used a little bit less salt. I would definitely recommend this soup though, they put the most interesting combinations in this soup and it sad very yummy! For dessert I ordered the chocolate and strawberry mochi and let me tell you DO NOT ORDER THESE. They were freezer burned and probably had been over a year old so this was a waste of 6 euros. I was disappointed to have such a satisfying meal and then end it with this. Lesson learned though! Overall great soup and decent rolls for the price you pay so if you're craving ramen and in this area, go for it.",
