    "Best Mexican food I have ever had! My boyfriend and I were visiting Barcelona from the New York City area and couldn't believe how good everything was. We split the nachos with guacamole, chicken taco, and the chicken enchiladas verdes - we would have liked to eat everything all over again but were full :). The staff was very friendly, setting was authentic and small, it was the best meal we had in Barcelona.",
