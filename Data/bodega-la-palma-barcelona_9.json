    "Another hidden gem in Barri Gotti. \u00a0We visited this Bodega as part of our culinary tour of the city - this was our Pinxtos as opposed to Tapas part of our tour. \u00a0Pinxtos are served with a skewer, self-serve, pay by the number of skewers left on your plate when you are done. \u00a0Wine or beer or other beverages are served in small quantities so you can take your \"montadito\" (a slice of bread with something on top) that is skewered. \u00a0DO NOT GRAB BY THE SKEWER! \u00a0Bodega la Palma is NOT touristy at all, and definitely a place to taste the true essence of the Pinxto and social life of local Barcelona.",
