    "We found by accident but this is our favorite spot in Barcelona. Sardo Classico was amazing. We bumped into a fun group from Britain and enjoyed a great, fun evening. Sangria was delicious. Food and drinks are prepared by hand. Small, cozy out of the way spot. Crowded but staff is friendly and accommodating.",
