    "Came here on the first day of warm sunshine in Barcelona this year. \u00a0The burgers were great as well as the fries. \u00a0My wife typically hates Mustard, but the mustard/mayo sauce complemented the burgers perfectly. \u00a0The service was friendly as well. \u00a0It's a perfect place to stop off \u00a0at after a day at the beach for a drink and a burger. Enjoy!",
