    "Had dinner here with two co-workers after reading of it in Lonely Planet's Barcelona guidebook.We stopped by without reservations after almost 3 hours of walking around, famished. \u00a0The wait for a seat indoors was 40 minutes, so we opted to sit outside and be served immediately. Being Feb, it was quite cold but the overhead heat lamps weakly helped ward it off.Note that while we were there the language we heard most spoken by guests was English...thus many tourists. \u00a0That should not be a deterrent because it was very good.SERVICE: 4.5. \u00a0Appreciated the cheerful attitude and patience of the gentleman who arranged for us to dine outside and who kindly explained items on the menu as well as quantity. \u00a0His recommendations were spot on. \u00a0(BTW, there is a 5% surcharge for outside seating. \u00a0Outside seating consisted of 3 umbrella-covered tables on the sidewalk, shielded by walls on 3 sides.)FOOD: 4.0. \u00a0We were very hungry. \u00a0The taste of the first bites created one of those rare occasions when one becomes even more ravenous after starting to dine. \u00a0We had the Iberian Board (mix of meats), octopus tapa, meatball tapa, heated bread with tomato sauce, and pate. \u00a0All were excellent. \u00a0We forgot the cold until we were sated. \u00a0I had the house red wine, and enjoyed it.AMBIENCE: 4.0. \u00a0crowded and friendly.",
