    "It is good, but I prefered Koku for ramen in Barcelona. Here's why: 1) The soja broth was not good - I even wonder if they didn't give me a fish broth by mistake. Very weird flavor. 2) The basic ramen (\u20ac7.70) come only with one slide of pork and some spring onions / seeweed. Definitely not as many toppings as at Koku, so I think you end up paying more here than at Koku for the same bowl. 2) So much hype here... it is good, but is it worth waiting in line for an hour? Not so sure. Ya-Hiro is definitely the most authentic place though - it's awesome to watch the chefs work - and their gyozas are amazing.",
