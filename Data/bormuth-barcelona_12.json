    "We went here because of the good reviews. And they didn't let us down. There was a good vibe, it smelled delicious and the food was really good. The waitresses were really kind and nice. The prices are good too. We had 9 dishes and 2 sangria and it costed us around \u20ac56. We are certainly going back again.",
