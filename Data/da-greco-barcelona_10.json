    "Some of the dishes can be a hit and miss. \u00a0Lobster pasta was a huge half lobster with pasta but over sauced, tortellini with white truffle was doughy and bland and not enough truffle flavor. \u00a0Best dishes are the more ordinary sounding such as lasagna and shrimp with pasta. I'd go back but only for certain dishes since it can be a strike out or home run depending what you order. They have moved a block away from the location that is shown in the pics.",
