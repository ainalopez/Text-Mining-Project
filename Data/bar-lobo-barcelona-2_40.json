    "Wow! \u00a0With an overwhelming selection of restaurants to choose from in this area, I looked for guidance from Lazarus at my hotel (La M\u00e9ridien). \u00a0Just across the street is this gem. \u00a0Best rigatoni with fresh mozzarella, lime, and mint. \u00a0 And lemon pie fir dessert (it's actually lemon chiffon). \u00a0Both totally recommended! \u00a0Plus free wifi. \u00a0And their prices are reasonable! \u00a0Good service too. \u00a0Funky ambiance with giant hanging orbs of light inside. \u00a0Outside seating too.",
