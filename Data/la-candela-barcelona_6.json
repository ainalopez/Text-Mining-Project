    "The hostess was rude and she complained about my friend in Spanish. The food took incredibly long and we were so tired after walking and getting lost in the Gothic area, looking for a Chinese dim sum place. Despite all these shortcomings, they were the best unplanned restaurant in our Barcelona trip.The seating outside was plentiful, the locals milled about the bar and basked in the night air and the tourists were encouraged to sit inside. The restaurant is charming, and the Catalan cuisine is locally sourced.We tried the tomato bread, fried Jalape\u00f1os, risotto, pad thai x 2, and pineapple dessert. The fried peppers were perfectly seasoned with sea salt and had a smokey flavor. Their pad thai was plentiful with seafood. The pineapple dessert was amazing! It was crunchy and crisp phyllo dough wrapped around a grilled pineapple slice. I loved that we got lost and found such a gem. If we had more time, I would have wandered the Gothic area some more and had another meal here.",
