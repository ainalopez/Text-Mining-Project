    "One of the best places we ate in Barcelona. After trying and failing to get into the hyped up El Glop, we walked a few streets over and stumbled upon La Trini. I can't speak for the other menu items, but I'd suggest to stick to their Spanish / Catalan choices. We went with the set Sunday menu for 15 EUR - such a great value with lots of interesting options.We tried the egglant soup, salmon truffle honey toast, and shrimp paella. The paella really hit the spot - crunchy outside with perfectly al dente rice. Washed it all down with their house sangria (!!!) and enjoyed watching the Catalan families around us do their thing. Service here was exceptional for Spanish standards. The waiters stored our suitcases and checked up on us several times. You can tell they have passion for the place, and it made the experience all the more enjoyable.",
