    "I found this place after a quick search on Yelp, which is located on a side street off La Ramblas. \u00a0There's actually quite a few restaurants along this alley street, but this place is one of the more popular eateries as I've seen a line outside the door day and night.To start, we ordered the Asparagus Iberico Ham Au Gratin and the Soft Spinach Salad, which were both excellent. \u00a0My favorite was the asparagus - huge pieces of asparagus wrapped in iberico ham and covered in a creamy cheese sauce. \u00a0The spinach salad was also tasty, as it was loaded with large chunks of bacon, raisins, generous parmesan cheese shavings, with a mushroom vinaigrette. \u00a0We ordered the Mixed Paella, as the paella is the house specialty. \u00a0They weren't as generous with the seafood as other places, but there was still a good amount of prawns, squid, and mussels, as well as some sausage and pork. \u00a0It was good, but didn't think it was anything to write home about.Quick Tip: \u00a0Get there around 8PM, when they re-open for dinner and you'll miss the 9PM dinner rush (which is the norm, as people eat late dinners in Spain, but much busier here).",
