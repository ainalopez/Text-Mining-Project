    "Food was good but expensive! The bad things was that we didn't get to see the menu and we trusted the waiter a little bit to much when he said that he had a concept for us (all the tourists). He suggested 5 courses, which we said ok for. In the end we ended up whit 6courses we had to pay for = an extra tomato bread.When we were finished the waiter thrown out bill in our faces, so we had to pay and leave. Didn't \u00a0feel to welcome. He also put an extra beer on our bill, which we saw and he wasn't really happy when we mentioned it. Expensive whit good food but they really try to fool all the tourists. The food is more affordable at La Boqueriaat Ramblas.",
