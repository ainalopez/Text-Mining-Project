    "I wouldn't even consider this tapas.. Is it? You order one menu item and it is about 3 bites. I believe they are called pinxtos (pronounced pinchos). It's difficult to share (as I thought tapas was about!), to me it's more like.. Appetizers a la carte. 95% of the items are on a baguette slice and have an average price of around 2\u20ac. They have about 30 hot and 39 cold choices. My husband and I had about 5-6 each, shared a pitcher of sangr\u00eda (10,30ish \u20ac) and had 1 dessert item (2,25\u20ac) each. The desserts weren't as large as the meal items and are above average... I would say eat dessert elsewhere. \u00a0The total was around 36\u20ac. Wasn't too bad considering we were very happy with the quality, taste, and service there... Our bellies and brains were happy! I wanted to take photos but everything looked so delicious, we ate and it was too late!! Worth the money.",
