    "This was our last dinner while in Spain for a week. \u00a0I think it was also one of the best we had. \u00a0They don't take reservations, so we showed up at 9pm with a group of 6. \u00a0Amazingly, we only had to wait for 10 minutes. \u00a0Service was excellent. \u00a0Polite, efficient and always attentive. \u00a0The manager/owner was all over the restaurant, directing traffic, helping staff and ensuring everyone was enjoying their meals all with a smile. \u00a0The food is excellent, maybe because they have foie? \u00a0The foie pate, the foie over fries, the grilled pawns, the gazpacho, iberico ham croquettes, fried eggplant.. amazing. \u00a0They are known for their sandwiches, which are good but the starters were the stars of the show. \u00a0Dessert was great too.I know there are awesome places to eat in Barcelona, but compared to the great pintxos places in San Sebastian, La Pepita can go head to head.",
