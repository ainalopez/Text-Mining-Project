    "I am a gringo, so my review may not reflect the thoughts of the locals. \u00a0We found Txacolin because we couldn't find the restaurant we were trying to go to. \u00a0We are glad we found Txacolin because it was a non-pretentiious atmosphere with bargain bites and alcohol.You sit at the bar and pay for what you eat at the bar. \u00a0It's great to eat at a place like this when you're not that hungry and are looking for something casual. \u00a0We had some fish, beef skewers, goat cheese, pate olilves, and peppers. \u00a0Everything was served hot.We also had lots of beer, wine, and apple cider to finish off our meal. \u00a0We left happy, drunk, and with a happy stomach. \u00a0We hope to return before we leave Barcelona.",
