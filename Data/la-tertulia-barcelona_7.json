    "The food is great and very affordable. If you are in poblenou and want a nice place with tapas and beers, you definitely have to check this out. The size of the portions is very big, which I found amazing.Be aware though that it is always crowded and you probably will have to wait. A lot. For tables, for waiters, for food, for beers. You will wait. That being said if you're in no hurry and you want to have a nice evening with friends I would totally recommend this place.",
