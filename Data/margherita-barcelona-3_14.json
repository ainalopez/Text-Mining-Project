    "We went for lunch one day because we were sick of tapas and wanted something different. \u00a0We were outside which can lead to being neglected, but not here. \u00a0The server was very attentive. \u00a0Before we got our food my husband went to the bathroom and noticed that the baker was freshly slicing all of the veggies for our pizza. \u00a0The pizza and pasta was amazing. \u00a0Overall very good experience.",
