    "I've eaten here 3 times, and still haven't written a review?!? \u00a0What have I been waiting for? \u00a0Perhaps I was under the haze of those knockout delicious blackberry mojitos... not only are they seductively beautiful, but they are lush, sweet and strong. \u00a0Reservations are highly recommended, because if you do come on a busy night, you might be waiting at that bar for a while, and be on your 2nd drink before getting a table. \u00a0As for the food - they celebrate the treasures from the sea, and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. \u00a0Prices are fair for the quality/quantity and service. \u00a0 If ever in the neighborhood, and the waitlist is short, try this place out. \u00a0(I kinda prefer their sister restaurant around the corner - it's a little bigger, too).",
