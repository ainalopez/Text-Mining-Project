    "I came here for paella and my wishes were beyond granted. My friend and I split the seafood, vegetable and chicken paella and it was enough food for four people at least (we ended up taking home leftovers). It was so tasty and got better the more we ate it! Scallops, mussels and prawns with the heads still on made for an excellent (if slightly intimidating) seafood medley. The chicken was ok but not great, but the flavors of the paella itself, the seafood and the grilled peppers more than made up for the chicken. The bill was \u20ac12,50 a person, not bad at all!",
