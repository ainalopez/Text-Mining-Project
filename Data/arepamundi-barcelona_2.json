    "Holy DELICIOUSNESS. I've been in Barcelona 5 days and I've already come here TWICE! If you're looking for something different than the usual tourist trap, then make your way to Arepamundi. If you've never had an arepa, let me be the first to chime you in on a delicious Colombian and Venezuelan dish? treat? snack? aka our version of side bread. (For the record, my parents are Colombian). Anyway, arepas are a corn-based type bread-ish creation. I wouldn't call it cornbread because it's not spongy but rather a cooked 'masa'. The Colombian version comes in many sizes but what distinguishes it the most from Venezuelan is that we don't stuff ours. Arepamundi is Venezuelan so it comes with all sorts of stuffings and varieties. \u00a0I highly recommend looking at the menu on the right top wall. It doesn't seem to be anywhere else and it has the best combos of arepas. I've had the P(something) criollo arepa which contains shredded beef, black beans. plantains, rice, cheese and the option of an egg. Moment of silence for the yummy yummy in my tummy .........You won't spent more than 5-7 euros and walk away with a happy full belly!Prosquick filling bite to eatnon-tourist trapmade to orderfresh ingredientsgluten freeinexpensiveConno where to really sit and eatin-and-out service",
