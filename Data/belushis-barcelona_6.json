    "I need to express to the readers that this is a bar / restaurant IN A HOSTEL. That being said, it is a great place to hang out and get a cheap beer and bite to eat. In no way is this a 5 star facility and that is ok because it's not trying to be. If you are a foodie or a young adult looking for a top notch meal then go some place else. It is what it is and that's a busy, fun, young student/traveler hang out!",
