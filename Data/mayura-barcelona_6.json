    "I am always looking for good Indian restaurants as I travel around the world. \u00a0The vegetarian food we ordered was delicious, well presented and mild as we ordered. \u00a0The ambiance is nice. \u00a0The bowls, cups, table layouts are cute, creative with CLASS. Better than most restaurants in India and USA that I have dined in. \u00a0Mayura has a permanent spot in my address book.",
