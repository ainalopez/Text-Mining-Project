    "If you wanted something specific, this is not the place.If you don't like seafood, you isn't the place for you.If you want to have a food adventure and experience the modern version of dinner theatre then, by all means, continue reading:)My wife and I came here with no idea what to expect.When we walked in, we were a bit overwhelmed because it's not structured like your typical restaurant. \u00a0The place looks like a diner with all the seating at the bar. \u00a0There are roughly 15 seats, all side by side. \u00a0On the other side of the bar, you have 4-5 chefs all cooking madly. \u00a0Behind the seats, is the lineup of people waiting to eat.... get in the line and stay there!When you get to your seat, you won't get a menu because there is no menu. \u00a0They'll ask you a few questions:1.What would you like to drink? 2. Is this your first time here?3. How many tapas do you want... 4 or 5?4. Do you like seafood?That's it, then the food will come... and it will all be amazing.The clams were outstanding. \u00a0The Spanish omelette is the best. \u00a0Their calamari would set a new world record for awesome... if awesome was quantifiable. \u00a0Seriously, it will change your mind about how calamari should be done.Some tips...They don't serve wine by the glass, you get the whole bottle. \u00a0The beer is gigantic. \u00a0If its just the two of you, it's best that you both order beer or both order wine. \u00a0Otherwise, you can be like me and drink a man-sized beer followed by half a bottle of my wife's wine.... although, I was pretty happy with my mistake.Go here!",
