    "Stopped her for tapas while our day of touring Barcelona. What a wonderful spot. Although they did not have a menu in English the servers were happy to help translate and help us with our order. The food was outstanding as well as the service. Really nice atmosphere and outside dining. If you are looking for something off the \"tourist\" area this is a nice place to stop and have a rest.",
