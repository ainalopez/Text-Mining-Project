    "Amazing seafood. \u00a0One of my favorite meals in Spain. \u00a0First , get the octopus (I had the large octopus). \u00a0Served with oil and a bit of paprika. \u00a0It was delicious, I think there are some pictures of it on yelp. \u00a0The razor clams were also terrific, cooked in oil, garlic with herbs, served with lemon. \u00a0Love those. \u00a0Patatas bravas was good, and something that should be a staple in every meal. \u00a0The chorizo was good, but not my favorite sausage of our travels. \u00a0I would recommend eating anything that came out of the sea here. \u00a0This place is super relaxed, they left us the bottle of wine and just asked how many glasses we drank at the end. \u00a0No real menu, just pick from what is on the bar, and it all depends on what was available that day. \u00a0Service was friendly.This place gets packed (with locals), so you might need to sit at the bar or wait for a table. \u00a0I'm disappointed that we didn't eat more meals here.",
