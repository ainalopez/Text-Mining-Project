    "Oh how I miss this place! Authentic Sicilian brick oven pizza in the heart of the Eixample neighbourhood in Barcelona. I have so many good memories from this place. I used to live close and ate here pretty often. The staff are always super friendly and funny. There's another place in Barcelona from the same owners but I prefer this one, it's a bit less fancy but more authentic. This place is usually packed and you might have to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated, but it's totally worth the wait.I recommend the parmiggiana pizza, but you can order whatever you want and you won't be disappointed, every single thing in their menu is delicious. The salads are pretty good too.Every time I eat a slice of NY pizza I cry a little inside and think of La Bella Napoli.",
