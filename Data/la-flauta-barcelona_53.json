    "This place is large and there can be wait but it is worth it. \u00a0We went on the earlier side \u00a0(8ish) and were seated in less than 5 minutes. \u00a0The service was prompt and the wait staff were very helpful - between my broken Spanish and their understanding and patience we easily got the dishes we wanted (no intimidation). \u00a0The food was great, the tapas portions are very large so you could easily over order. \u00a0The atmosphere is very friendly and we ended up chatting with the table next to us for quite a while. \u00a0They did not order in rounds but instead all at once - and dish after dish kept coming to their table until they were overwhelmed - so a word of ADVICE - order a couple of things, eat and assess from there. \u00a0The waiters know you will be there for a long time so they have no problem with multiple rounds of orders (and the food comes very quickly). \u00a0Good quality and very fun. \u00a0Don't miss this place \u00a0- We will be back!",
