    "I just got back from Barcelona, Spain and I heard from people in the US and our hotel concierge that El Quatre Gats or 4 Cats was very good for Catalan cuisine. This is also supposedly where Pablo Picasso hung out when he was younger. The hotel that we stayed at highly recommended the restaurant but let me tell you it is a very touristy restaurant with overpriced and overrated food. There was not a single local in the establishment on the Saturday night that we went there. To top it off, there was a huge cockroach crawling up the wall by my wife's head. It was really gross and since we saw the cockroach at the beginning of our meal, we could not eat very much. So you might be thinking that the restaurant would do something for us but the only thing they did was kill the cockroach for us, that's it. In terms of actual food, they recommended to everyone the sea bass and the entrecote. The sea bass was flavorful but had a bunch of bones. The entrecote was ok but not when you take in the cost of 20 euros for something you could get for 10 euros somewhere else and taste the same. Suffice it to say if you like tourist restaurants, this is your place but we will not be going there again or recommending it to anyone else.",
