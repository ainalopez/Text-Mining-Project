    "The dude of food wandered in here and was glad he was traveling alone as the place was intimate but inviting.The short story is the staff is cool, the beers are cold and flowing, the food is good and the prices are reasonable. It is a great place to wander into before or after viewing art at the BCN Painters Route art gallery in Barcelona.",
