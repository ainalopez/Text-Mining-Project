    "Visited Barcelona in February. I heard that Quimet y Quimet was one of the best tapas places out there in the city, and so I knew that I had to go try it. It was actual my first experience trying tapas, and I had no idea that it would be so mind-blowing good! I ordered vermouth, then got mussels, pork cheek with chips, artichokes with Brie cheese and caviar, and an open-faced salmon sandwich with truffled honey. All of them were AMAZING. Pork cheek was incredibly tender, the artichokes-cheese-caviar was smooth like butter, and the salmon sandwich paired perfectly with the fragrant truffled honey.You HAVE to go to Quimet y Quimet for the ultimate tapas experience in Spain. No regrets! (BIG TIP: show up early to wait for the place to open; within 15 minutes, it is packed!).",
