    "My first time in Barcelona, my husband and I had stumbled upon this place by chance. We saw a lot of people inside, so we decided to check it out. It was an awesome experience. The bartenders are charming and funny. The sangria was delicious. A guaranteed good time. My second time in Barcelona, I'd tried a few other popular places for tapas such as Quimet & Quimet, but I was left disappointed. So, I returned here, and it is now officially my favorite place for tapas in Barcelona. I'll be back for sure.",
