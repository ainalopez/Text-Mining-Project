    "The prefixed menu of 23 Euros per person is worth it! Unlimited yummy bread to go with your mother of all meat and cheese platter. The meal comes with a bottle of house wine and dessert at the end with a drink (coffee etc.) It is more than enough for two people and if you are ordering the prefixed menu, come hungry. Service was good and friendly. Ambience romantic, so coming here for a special occasion or pretty much any occasion is worth it.",
