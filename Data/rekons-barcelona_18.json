    "What can I say about this freaking fantastic place? I came here because of Yelp's reviews and I came on a Wednesday night thinking that it wouldn't be very crowded. Every single table outside and inside was full to the max and there were people waiting for a table. I put down my name for a table outside and after I waited for about 25 minutes the waiter asked me if I would be willing to sit with a couple of guys that were already seated at a table. \u00a0 I was happy to share a table with them, their names are Steve and George. We talked about everything you could possibly talk about for two hours. Finally the bartender told us we had to leave because they were closing the place. I had the most delicious mushroom empanada and a delicious vermouth. The company was wonderful, the waitstaff was excellent, and the ambience was perfect. Come to this place.",
