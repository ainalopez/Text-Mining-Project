    "Gluten free sandwiches! Surrounded by so many bread bakeries in this city, I'm glad to have this place with gluten free bread. Average price for a sandwich is 4 euros. I had the tuna sandwich which was really good. My friend had a wasabi kebab sandwich with tender, juicy meat. She said it was one of the best sandwiches she's ever had. My other friend had the Iberian ham and cheese which was a little salty, but she still liked it.",
