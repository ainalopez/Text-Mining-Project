    "One of the weirdest food experiences I had lately. Upon entering the well-designed restaurant you will be greeted by an Agent Smith, complete with headset. He will take your order and forward it into the kitchen. Not sure which part of the matrix is failing, but on several occasions only half of it made it back to our table. The waiters were constantly making themselves more work than necessary, and the food combinations sound interesting but turn out to be just plain weird. My colleagues mentioned the food to be rather lukewarm, too. On the other hand, the prices are suprisingly low for a place that tries to be classy.",
