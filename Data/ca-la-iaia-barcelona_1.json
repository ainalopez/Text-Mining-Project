    "Insane value for the money, for 9 euros for lunch, you get a drink (huge bottle of water or wine, beer etc, appetizer, entree, and dessert). I definitely was full after the appetizer but I pushed through!! There's a ton of options for both the starters and mains, I think the day I was there there was maybe about 10 choices for each and I tried the fried eggs, jamon with fried potatoes to start and beef cheek and salad for the main. After that I stuck with fruit for dessert but they also had a few cakes as well as options. The server was also super sweet and wrote out the menu for me since I was the first person to arrive at a very American time of 12:30 pm.",
