    "Food: Dear lord, this food was DELICIOUS. For apps we had the beef tartar (don't recommend, sort of lackluster), the octopus (AMAZING), and the scallops. So much flavor in these appetizers, loved it! For our main courses we have the paella and the pork. The paella was amazing! Looked and tasted great! Not the best paella I've had in Barcelona, but definitely up there! The pork had to be the best thing I've ever had in Spain. Tender, bold flavor, and just perfect in all aspects. I could just eat that forever. For dessert, we had the ice cream, was kind of meh, nothing special.Service: Very attentive and friendly. They set up a great atmosphere for you to enjoy your food.Overall, I would go here again and again. Food was on point and service put a great taste in my mouth.",
