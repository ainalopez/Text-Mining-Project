    "We stopped here on the way to Sagrada Familia and it was a great quick lunch spot. I had the poached eggs and smoked salmon and my friend had the veggie burger. Both were delicious. You order at the bar and they bring it to your table. Definitely casual but the food is delicious and at a good price. They don't have outdoor seating like many of the places nearby but the inside has plenty of seating.",
