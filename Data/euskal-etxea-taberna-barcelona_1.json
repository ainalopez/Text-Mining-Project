    "I'm always forgetting the name of this place! Dang! I have no idea how to pronounce the name (help!).Seriously one of the most memorable parts about my visit to Barcelona. My sister heard of this place from her friend who studied abroad in Barcelona and recommended this tapas bar to us!Dumb comment: Okay, I'll admit I had no idea what tapas were before I came her. I thought tapas were the same thing as Filipino tapa which is dried or cured beef lol. Oh well, you learn something new everyday.I was actually whining about coming here because I was lazy to walk to the Gothic Quarter all the way from Las Ramblas but I'm sure glad I did!It's a trendy place where you just grab as many tapas as you want from the bar and you pay later, honor system. The tapas they served were mainly small sandwiches or bruschetta-style snacks along with croissants stuffed with meat. It was about 1.80 euro per tapa I believe. You MUST go there if you're ever in Barcelona!It's crowded with a mix of locals and tourists so you know this place is happening!",
