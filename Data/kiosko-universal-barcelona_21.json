    "This is a wonderful seafood kiosk located inside and to the left of the main entrance of La Boqueria. We grabbed a spot at the counter and enjoyed deliciously fresh calamari and fried artichokes. The chefs don't speak English but we made out just fine by pointing and with our rudimentary understanding of some fish words in Spanish. This spot is a little pricier than some of the other kiosks because of the proteins they serve, but it's well worth it. Grab a seat at the counter, order a la carte, and enjoy a great Barcelona food experience!",
