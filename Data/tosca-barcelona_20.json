    "By far the best tapas in Barcelona. We tried many places and no where was there a restaurant where everything we ate was fantastic. The price was also very affordable. The food wasn't the usual tapas fried potatoes and side of mussels. It was a true fusion of delicious and tapas. The fried potatoes had this amazing curry mayonnaise for dipping and they were the best potatoes in barcelona and maybe the WORLD!!! If you look at my photos we ordered a plethora of food, every one was fantastic. I recommend the cheese dip, very cheesy, but a great dish for sharing. We also got a pitcher of white sangria, which was some of the best and cheapest we found in the city.",
