    "Mexican food should be bursting with flavor, and this has none. \u00a0I had a carne asada burrito and the meat had no seasoning and a chewy texture. \u00a0There was no sauce of any kind in the burrito, but there were a selection to add. \u00a0After living in California for five years, I came to love burritos. \u00a0This is nothing like a taco truck burrito. \u00a0This is another sad example of food that is supposed to be tasty being completely watered down.",
