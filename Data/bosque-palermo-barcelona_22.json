    "By far the most traditional and flavorful paella in Barcelona. In the heart of Eixample, Bosque makes you feel like a local. If you are not ordering seafood paella, pulpitos a la Gallega, pan con tomate, and/or sangria, then you're doing it wrong. Small space so call ahead and make a reservation and if you want to be very well prepared, go ahead and tell them that you will be ordering paella!!!! I would return to BCN just for a bite of the paella.",
