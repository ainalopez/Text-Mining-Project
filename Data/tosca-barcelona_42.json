    "Went here our first night in Barcelona and had such a good experience. It was quiet but not empty, and our servers were all really nice and helpful, especially for dealing with four Americans. The Tapas was excellent, and a really good price. Same with sangria (we got 2 pitchers!). Not to mention that the restaurant itself is lovely and clean, and right across from an absolutely gorgeous concert hall. Overall it made or a wonderful experience.",
