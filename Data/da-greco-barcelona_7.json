    "My husband and I were visiting from the U.S. and my husband found this place on yelp. \u00a0It was amazing!!!!! We didnt have reservations, but the staff was extremely nice and spoke with the manager to ask if they could squeeze us in. \u00a0Luckily we were there early! We took their recommendation and ordered a shrimp avocado appetizer, burrata cheese appetizer, lobster pasta, and some kind of salt crusted nystrip. It was amazing!!!! Well cooked, and well seasoned. Hands down, one of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona. All in all, food was amazing, and service was exceptional!",
