    "Reputation well deserved as fusion japanese. We got seated in front of who was perhaps the sous chef. We opted for the 2nd omakase course. \u00a0Our amuse bouche was a trio that started with fried satoimo slices with foie gras dip, with deep fried baby squid in dashi broth and anchovy with apple drizzled liberally with yuzuWe had an amazing dashi with shiitake mushroom broth.Followed by spanish caviar with yuzu gelli with mashed pink turnipBaby octopus with mirugai and razor clam with yuzu gelli, ? sauce and blanched green onionsNyumen with sea cucumber (best i ever had) and spanish asari (chef substituted the pork out for me). Broth was spectacular, dashi but tasted different from the shiitake soup.Semi grilled sashimi lobster with a round robin of dipping sauce as follows - lobster head foie with yuzu, toasted sesame seed, NOT kikkoman soy sauce, sea salt accompanied by rice cracker lobster and bits of blanced lobsterBlack truffle slices with chu toro, toro (diced and sliced) and maguro with uni and freshly grated wasabiSpanish beans tempura, with yuzu foam and grilled black codAma ebi and baby ebi with veggie and fish cake with ebi + yuzu dipping sauceWagyu tataki with brown rice and fried noriWe had to skip the sashimi course (would have been maguro agari, anago and a temaki). I was ready to exploded at this point.But we also had a 2 course dessert. Since dessert is reserved for a separate stomach - we had itYogurt ice cream with yuzuShunka tiramisu \u00a0- dorayaki cake, green tea marscapone, chocolate craker and home made expresso ice cream that was so strong I thought it punched me in the face when I tasted it.",
