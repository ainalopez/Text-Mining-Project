    "This discovery came by way of Belle Barcelona's blog and it did not disappoint. My gal pals and I pub crawled through the Born, landing here for dinner perched on stools facing the service kitchen window-score! The crowd was beautiful, the food was the best we had in Barcelona. I think we may have sampled 75% of the menu! I didn't want to leave and upon jetting sadly grabbed a bag of their Marvin's almonds that gave me a nostalgic trip back when settling in Boston. Get yourself here, if there is a wait...it is worth it!!!",
