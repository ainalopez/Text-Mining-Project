    "Good food and drinks for the price. We were there on a Friday around 7:30pm. It was pretty load and busy around 8pm but it didn't look like anyone had to wait for long. Very cheap majitos and margaritas. Good atmosphere and everyone was very friendly. We sat up top near the edge and it was pretty cool watching the bar tenders making the drinks (soo many majitos!)We were caught off guard when we were asked if we wanted to include a tip as we were paying. First time we had been asked or seen anything about tipping during our time in Spain.",
