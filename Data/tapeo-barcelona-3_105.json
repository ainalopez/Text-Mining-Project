    "Outstanding.You'll need a reservation, and it's a tiny little place in Barcelona's old city, but it is worth it! \u00a0Everything is good, especially the Moroccan lamb! \u00a0Also delicious were the honey-mustard ribs, and the beef cheeks.It's a cozy little place that feels like a chef's home kitchen. \u00a0You will get to know the other patrons dining with you, since it's a tight squeeze, but that's part of the fun.Enjoy!",
