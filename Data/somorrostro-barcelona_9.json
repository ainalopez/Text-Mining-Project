    "Great menu (also available in English) with a wide variety of options - seems like the menu is based on seasonal ingredients. \u00a0The menu is pretty heavily focused on seafood. \u00a0Also, they serve paella even though it is not on the menu -- we didn't have it ourselves, but we saw another table eating it after we had ordered.",
