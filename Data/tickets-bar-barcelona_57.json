    "Walked in early with no res and got seated! Score!O.K. I've seen pictures, had dreams about it, watched Anthony Bourdain make O faces while eating them so to finally get my face around the famous olive spheres was a really big thing. And yes they are bloody good. As with any modernist restaurant some things blow your top off and others are just not your thing. The hope is that the majority of things blow your top off. I'd have to say yes they did. I won't bore you with a play by play because this place has been covered by every \u00a0foodie with a computer or celly.The only thing about this meal I'd change is that I let our waiter choose for us. Next time I'll take the reigns. Not that his picks were bad but there were a few things I really wanted to check out that we didn't get. Cheers",
