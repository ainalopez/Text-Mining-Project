    "When I planned my trip to Barcelona my must have dinner in Spain was Paella. This restaurant destroyed what should have been a great meal. My wife's tuna was too salty. Our friend and his wife had the Cannelloni and the Hake. The jake was very good the cannelloni was half eaten. The waiter must have had a fight at home because he was in a bad mood and inattentive.",
