    "Tourist trap. Over rated, and over priced. Service very stuffy and not very good. \u00a0Food was just average, except lamb shops that were a major disappointment, had to send back as it was all fat. \u00a0Took 45 minutes for replacement meal as other guests sat and waited with their meals. \u00a0bread 3 \u20ac/person, butter 3\u20ac. \u00a0Decor, uninteresting. \u00a0Worst meal in BCN.",
