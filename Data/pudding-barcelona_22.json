    "Food was mediocre. Cakes were big and freshly baked, but not as good as they looked. Viennese coffee shake was horrible - exceedingly sweet and warm. Perhaps just a case of bad ordering, but I felt ill for the rest of the day. Service was terrible. Waited 20 minutes for someone to take out order (we tried to order at the counter but were sent away and told it was table service only). Then every single item arrived individually over the course of 15 minutes with one item forgotten altogether. Overall very disappointed.",
