    "On our recent rendezvous to Barca, my boyfriend and I were strolling along the beach and found CDLC. This place is definitely pricey but the ambience is great.The restaurant is huge. It was pretty crowded when we were there.The restaurant itself is very nice and seems very trendy. We ordered yellowtail hamachi served with passion fruit sauce and land caviar. It was pretty tasty. The presentation of all the dishes was pretty.I had the rocket and iberico ham salad which was delicious. My boyfriend had the black ink risotto with squid, octopus, and spring vegetables. We pretty much inhaled all of our food. The waiter looked like a model and was nice enough to recommend what to do and where to go at night :)",
