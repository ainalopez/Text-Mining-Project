    "I'm from the Pacific Northwest and to find a place that appreciates IPAs and other varieties of craft beer so close to our new place in Les Corts was an amazing surprise. Ori, the owner/operator, was an engaging host who enthusiastically talked about the tap list and his love of micro brewed beers. Not only will I be a frequent visitor but our family, that includes two teenage daughters, \u00a0were made to feel welcome as we watched our first home Barcelona game.I highly recommend coming to El Tap, saddling up to the bar and sampling from the 12 craft beers.",
