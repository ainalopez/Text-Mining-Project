    "Incredible fine-dining experience! Very vegan-friendly. The vegan options on their menu are clearly labeled (although oddly I ordered a soup labeled vegan, and when I double-checked about it, they said it had egg in it, and took it back--I imagine that was just a fluke). Aside from that it was one of the best meals I had in Barcelona. My mom and I wanted to go back and would have if we had more time there! If you stop by in the morning, grab one of their juices to-go--they are beautiful and tasty.",
