    "We rolled in a little hot after walking over two miles with five kids (it's not really set up for kids but they dealt well). \u00a0Patio was perfect place for cooling off, giving kids a place to run down to beach/ocean and incredible people watching. \u00a0Service was definitely adequate and food was traditional spanish albeit in larger portions than we've experienced. \u00a0Gazpacho incredible but a meal by itself, patatas buhran (think sliced potatoes covered in good nacho cheese) were incredible. \u00a0Salmon tartar, fideua and fried eggs with papas y jamon (only in Spain)...all excellent. For location prices reasonable.",
