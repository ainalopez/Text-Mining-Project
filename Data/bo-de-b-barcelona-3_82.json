    "In search of that one cheap eats place that's local, fresh, tasty and cheap? This is an awesome sandwich place that'll fill'er up. Seriously good grilled chicken sandwich with your choice of plenty o' veggies that you choose, and they (the nice woman and her friend, the only two people running the joint) pile on. There are an array of house sauces that you can choose to drizzle into your sandwich to make it even more tasty than it already is such as: garlic, mayo, spicy, avocado, pesto. The whole shebang for less than 4 euros. The only downfall that I had was the extremely long line and the wait time ended up being more than 45 mins for a sandwich. The place is small with a few tables and chairs and space is limited. Of course the best thing is to grab a sandwich on the go and sit on the steps of the old, ancient post office across the street to enjoy your food while soaking up some sun and people watch. Yum and fun all in one!",
