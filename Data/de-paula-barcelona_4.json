    "One of the owners at Spice told us to check this place out. He said the locals love it and that we'd love it, too. I guess he didn't realize that we're from New York, where some of the best burgers are made. It's a nice place with a good vibe, but I'm not too crazy about the thick white bun and the beef was too rare for us. Also, we found everything super salty. We ordered the first burger with cheese, the chicken burger, both potatoes, and the corn on the cob.",
