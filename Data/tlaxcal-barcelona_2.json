    "Amazing Mexican food! \u00a0Being from Chicago, my expectations for mexican food are high. Tlaxcal not only lived up to them but surpassed them. \u00a0Being vegetarians, my husband and I had hard time finding many options to eat in Spain through our 10 day trip. \u00a0We were so happy to find this place as it had many options! It definitely satisfied our mexican food craving being away from home! We had their Guacamole (must try), Nachos, and enchiladas. \u00a0They were all great! \u00a0They also gave bunch of salsas on the side, which were a great compliment to everything that we ordered. \u00a0You don't have to look anywhere else if you want a great mexican meal in Barcelona!",
