    "Average house wine, order beer instead.It's in a local neighborhood. Rather long wait for outdoor tables if you go after 8:30pm. There were many empty indoor tables. Prices are reasonable.Amazing spinach croquettes with honey. it's a very unique dish. I tried their version of calamari with tartar sauce, which was also pretty good.",
