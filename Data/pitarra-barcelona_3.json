    "Super cool place in a very authentic neighborhood. \u00a0We had the mushroom special and gamberis to start and for main the Seafood Paella. \u00a0All very tasty and authentic. \u00a0Servers spoke English and very nice. \u00a0I had a special edition beer by Adrian Ferra (El Bulli) which I was surprised about...had no idea he made beer now...lol",
