    "In all fairness we may have ordered the wrong dishes, but there were a couple that blew our socks off. However, it's hard to get pass the ambiance at this place. Dear Sirs, get a can of paint and spruce this place up. I don't think you would need to do much to appear more put together and closer aligned to your food. The room takes away from the experience. Outstanding dishes include anything with meat. So-so...in my opinion; nitro popcorn, crab ravioli soup, and razor clams. Nitro was clever, but tasteless. Soup tasted a bit like flavored soup with, albeit...the most amazing tasting (one) ravioli in it. The razor clams were overdone...hard...the ham was crisped too much so it tasted like bac-o bits. Pigs trotters and the Iberian piglet cooked for 24 hours served with sun chokes were outstanding. Prices for the food are reasonable. I rather pay a little more and get better focus from the kitchen with a cozy, sexy space to enjoy it in...unitl next time.",
