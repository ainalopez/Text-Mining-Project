    "Really nice restaurant to stop by if you are in the area. The local doesn't have many tables but is quite spacious. The quality of the food is good and they have a wide variety of options. The juices are natural and very refreshing. In terms of music and ambience I didn't think it was particularly special, but it's a good place to take your friends for a brunch. The staff was very friendly and helpful:)",
