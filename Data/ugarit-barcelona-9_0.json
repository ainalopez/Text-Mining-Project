    "Easily the best Arabic food I've ever had. This is truly delicious. I highly recommend their fatush salad, phenomenal. Falafel is unquestionably the best I've had and main entrees are tasty. Topped off by exceptional service, I highly recommend this place. Came twice and consistently great experiences.",
