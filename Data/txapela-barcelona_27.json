    "We wandered into this little tapas bar while walking around Barcelona. It looked lively we stopped inside. The concept is simple: sit down at the bar and choose your tapas from behind the glass counter (or refer to your placemat -- it has photos of all of the available items). Simply point to what you want (knowing a little Spanish does help, especially if you know your numbers). When we were there it was during Happy Hour. We got 3 very large tapas and 2 small glasses of house wine for 6 Euro total! It was a great deal. I'm an adventurous eater so I just picked 3 items that looked unusual and they were. One thing I ordered was octopus and it was delicious. There are better tapas bars in the city, but this place is great for my fellow budget travelers out there.This place is a great value and is a wonderful way to sample Barcelona's tasty tapas, and I'm not so sure it caters to tourists because the menu was only in Spanish and the employees only spoke Spanish (as it SHOULD be in Spain)! Stop in if you want to go on a culinary adventure without too much effort.",
