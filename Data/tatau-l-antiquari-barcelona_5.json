    "This is a great place for a delicious, friendly meal in special surroundings and is conveniently located near the Sants train station. The menu is based on the best recipes from the grandmothers of the owners, chefs and their friends and the ingredients are fresh and locally produced. \u00a0The interior of the restaurant is completely outfitted with antique furniture and decor so every table and place setting is a unique experience.To top it off, the prices are reasonable and the service is very friendly. \u00a0I highly recommend it for a lunch or dinner in Barcelona.",
