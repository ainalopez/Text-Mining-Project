    "This restaurant took us by surprise. We had no idea that we were going to end up eating at a place that would become such a memorable experience during our trip to Spain. We dropped by here for dinner because it was conveniently located by the apartment that we were staying at. We saw people eating burgers and fries, so we didn't think much of it when we first walked in.The restaurant is very ornate on the outside and the interior is classy. Definitely had a sophisticated, yet welcoming feel to it.We ordered the jamon with Catalan bread (a typical starter) and fried aubergines, which lead the meal to a great start. Next up, we had the \u00a0swordfish ceviche in \"Tiger's Milk\" (coconut milk I think) and it was also tasty. The main course was the cod fish in cream cheese sauce with quince. It was superbly done and very flavorful. Definitely the highlight of the meal! The flavors melded well together and every bite was delectable. I think we ended up licking the plate completely clean. This was the standout dish for us.Last up, the \"Gin & Tonic in textures\" dessert ended the meal in pure bliss. It was a very creative interpretation of an edible gin & tonic. Imagine light cloud-like layers of foam and jelly, infused with deep gin flavors. It introduces you to a unique experience in terms of the textures you feel on your tongue. Beautifully presented with a sprinkle of pink peppercorn on top. Very delicious and definitely something to share with at least two people. All in all, the experience we had here was amazing and we would come back again the next time we visit Barcelona.",
