    "Leaving park guell, I saw a sign for the best iced coffee.. One cannot walk away from a sign like that. I had to investigate further. Being that I love iced coffee!And of course it was delicious! 5 stars for good coffee and kindness. This business only recently opened, and I really hope become super successful. As the owner was so incredibly friendly. So you have to come here and support good customer service! Sadly i wasn't hungry so didn't order food. But I can see what they were making, and looked yummy! I regret not trying a bite now. The location is perfect after spending all afternoon walking around park guell. The location is just at the top of the escalators. It's to the right if your leaving the park, and to the left if your going to the park.",
