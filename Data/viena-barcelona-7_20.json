    "The Best Jamon Iberico Flauta in Barcelona and very good cafe con leche as well. \u00a0This has to be Las Ramblas best eatery with the best prices. \u00a0The sandwich has tremendous flavor and the bread, what can I say, great flavor and crunchy. \u00a0 No one item in this sandwich overwhelms, is a great meal.",
