    "This isn't your average tapas bar and definitely my favorite in Barcelona. \u00a0First tip is to book reservations if you can. \u00a0What attracted us were the unique dishes. \u00a0Service was great and loved the decor. \u00a0Now let's talk about the food.Seabass Ceviche - Best dish we ordered. \u00a0I think I could've had about 3 of these to myself!Duck Timbale - DeliciousJamon - Cut real thin - reminded me of prociuttoThai beef noodle salad - Didn't have a lot of asian flavors but it was nice to mix it upSeafood Paella - Definitely one of the best we've had in Barcelona. \u00a0Muy bien!",
