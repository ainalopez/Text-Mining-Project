    "Perhaps the best meal I've had in Spain to date. Owner/chef, Javier doesn't disappoint. We came in a bit late and he served us up a wonderful fusion inspired meal smiling all the while.I had the sashimi to start. Simply divine. Garnished with ginger and a delectable sauce I was in heaven. Followed it up with a version of bun bo hue (soup) with shrimp and beef. Delicious. To top it off we shared a rosemary and black pepper encrusted cheesecake. I seriously almost cried. Amazing meal, great staff, fantastic dining experience.",
