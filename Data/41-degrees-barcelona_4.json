    "Do you need a meal of 41 amuse bouche? No. Do you need a meal that take 2 1/2 and a trip around the world though the eyes of modernist chef? No. Was it totally fucking awesome and something special. HELL YES!Things to note-1. it's 41 one amuses, not 41 course and many are served together. This is a good thing. 41 course would be way too much for and it is really interesting to see how it progresses and works with all the dishes. Ingredients like yuzu and wasabi popped up in quite a few dishes2.they were very accommodating to dietary needs. Other than not drinking alcohol I don't have any but they made five different drinks that are usually paired with the dishes and are alcoholic, non-alcoholic for me.3.they have a couple of El Bulli dishes but are doing their own things but there are definitely El Bulli staff in the tiny kitchen.4. The flavours are very subdued to my South East Asian and North American trained tastebud. This was good thing since there were so many dishes but if you are expected very over the top flavours you wouldn't find that in most dishes. 5. Will the dishes are inspired from around the world they are very much a Spanish and European take. When they did get mimic the original dish like ginger miso cod was when it was most disappointing since I've had the dishes that inspired it.6.The best is when they took an inspiration like Borscht (which they said was russian) and use it with something like a raw oyster.All in all, it's expensive, it's indulgent, it's over-the-top in term of presentation and it's awesome.",
