    "We were disappointed. A couple from GB we met waiting in line, told us it had been highly recommended to them. However, the food was not served at the proper temperature and although my salmon was good, my wife's shrimp and clams with noodles, was 95% noodles and not all that tasty. Very, very little sea food. Certainly not on my recommend list. Sorry.",
