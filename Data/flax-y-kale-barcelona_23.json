    "The service was a little slow but nice.. To be fair it was a Saturday at lunchtime so they were very must. The avocado toast was really good. The salmon entree was definitely one of my favorite meals of all time. The quinoa salad under the salmon was so delicious I could've eaten another bowl of it by itself. I can't wait to go back and try everything else.",
