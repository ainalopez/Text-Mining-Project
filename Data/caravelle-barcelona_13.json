    "I've been craving eggs all week, so I was thrilled to see this place was open on the nations holiday and offering brunch. I ordered their version of huevos rancheros. The tortilla was crispy and heaped with egg, tomatoes, cilantro, beans, queso fresco, a green chile sauce of some sort, and celery. The caf\u00e9 con leche is delightful although it's served in a bar glass so watch your fingers. Great atmosphere with open window and door. Their wi-fi is limits to a certain number of people, so keep trying if you can't get through.",
