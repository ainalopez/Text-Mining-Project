    "Not a pasta fanatic but we got lured in by the five star reviews. Everything did taste fresh and homemade and the service was friendly though. Order upon entry. they speak English so they'll walk you through the options, and then pick a seat. Everything comes w bread, drink (beer, wine, juice, water, anything they have really) and dessert: brownie, dulce de leche cake, tiramisu or cheesecake \u00a0Empanadas were good. \u00a0Three included in the specials. One included with the ravioli special. The ravioli was fresh but the sauce was bland and overly topped w parm which I happen to also not love so I simply did a lil scraping -- skip for me. The frisuli (twisted spaghetti) pesto was better than expected cause if the fresh, punchy flavor from the basil. However, just too much pasta. I prob wouldn't be back cause it just lacked the tasty flavors I love but it may be great if you like a simple pasta.... Or if you're traveling on a budget. I got so full I couldn't eat the rest of the day so I was bummed not to be able to try something more remarkable but that's just me, total grumpy pants.",
