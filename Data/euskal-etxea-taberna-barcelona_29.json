    "A great find! The place is well kept, clean and comfortable. The typical basque pinchos are just fantastic. The big variation of fabulous creations on the self-serving bar makes the choices pretty difficult. So at the end I have tried so many pinchos that my belly was ready to explode. But every bite was delicious. I will definitely go back.",
