    "Great place and only wished we had found sooner. We found it on an internet search for top tens and decided to give it a try. Calling it a tapas bar really does it a disservice as they specialize in traditional fare and do not cover the counters with premade options. Everything was made to order and in a meticulous manner with the best ingredients.We chose to sit at the bar so we could watch the chef and for such a small place, they had a large staff. The chef would come over between courses and seemed genuinely interested in our opinion while helping us with suggestions on various courses. We chose to just pick from all over the menu and did not have entrees but instead chose various specialties including the back cut of Iberian ham which has more in common with a great steak than anything else.Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back on our next visit.",
