    "Wonderfully creative and delicious meal in Barcelona! We were able to walk in and get a table for 4 at 7 pm sharp with the understanding that we'd have to leave by 9 pm. They admitted a few more walk-ins after us as well.The dishes were innovative and delicious. Spring tree with pistachio acorns is a work of art. Prawn with its fish soup was best bite of shrimp I've had in my life.All three cocktails from the 41 degrees menu were also incredible- in particular, the cocoa and citrus cachaca cocktail convinced me that cocoa and citrus belong like peanut butter and jelly.",
