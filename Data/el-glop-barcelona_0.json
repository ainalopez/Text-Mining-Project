    "On a recent visit to Barcelona, during our honeymoon, my wife and I spent took time to visit some extended family of mine living in this marvelous city. They invited us to join them for dinner near their homes at a neighborhood staple called Taverna El Glop (Carrer de Sant Llu\u00eds, 24, 08012 Barcelona).The restaurant is on a corner and is fairly intimate. You can walk right by it if you're paying much attention. They had reserved us a table for 14 on the 2nd floor. Getting up there was a little tight, but manageable. The food is exceptional! We had dishes including paella, fried mozzarella, and a delicious gigantic creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. The paella had enormous pieces of crab and gigantic shrimp. What a meal! Everything tasted very freshly made. We began dinner at about 9:30pm or so, and finished with dinner after midnight... typical for Barcelona. The staff is exceptional, very homely & inviting.If you're ever in this part of Barcelona, or just looking for an authentic Spanish meal in this eclectic European city, make sure to visit Taverna El Glop. Your visit will most assuredly leave your taste buds wanting for more.",
