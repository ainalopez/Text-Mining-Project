    "This being my first trip to spain, I expected hundreds of tapas restaurants in the style of Seattle's Harvest Vine (harvestvine.com). Having been in Madrid and Barcelona two weeks, this is the only tapas restaurant I've found that I would rave about.Sit at the bar. Order a wide variety. Enjoy.Here is what is great about this restaurant:1. Exceptionally fresh ingredients, cooked to order.2. Open kitchen. You can see everything being prepared.3. Interact with the cooks. They're having fun and they want you to have fun too.4. The bar is where you want to eat. Food as theater.Your meal won't be inexpensive, but it's a good value when you consider the location (very centrally located), the ambiance (festive, friendly), and the quality of the ingredients (exceptional).",
