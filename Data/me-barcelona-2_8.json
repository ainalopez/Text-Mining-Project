    "Me, mother in Vietnamese, is one of the best restaurants in Barcelona. \u00a0The unique cuisine designed and created by owner Javier (Catalonian by birth, professor at Tulane University in New Orleans) and his chef, a Vietnamese art student, makes for a lovely marriage of local products, Vietnamese cooking, and Cajun/Creole heart and soul. \u00a0We loved this place so much we went back three times. \u00a0Javier, the perfect host, treated us to local drinks, tales of his American experience, and warm Spanish hospitality. \u00a0By the end of our trip, I felt like we were long lost friends. \u00a0I think of this place often and wish we could relocate just to hang out there. \u00a0Can't wait to return for more Catalonian wines and Chef Thang's unique and addictive dishes!",
