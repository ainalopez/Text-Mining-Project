    "Absolutely overpriced tourist trap with poorly educated staff. The food was rather mediocre, there are much better alternatives in the city. And they wouldn't even let us in with a folded brompton bike, just because apparently their lawer told them to not let anyone in with bikes and roller skates. I mean can they see the difference between a big bike and a folded bike, which is basically the size of a bag? And it's in a city where half of the people go everywhere by bike",
