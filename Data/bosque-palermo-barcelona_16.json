    "Would you like some paella with your salt? Sooooo salty it burns your tongue.  People love this place and we can't figure out why. \u00a0Service was slow even by European standards. The people next to us were in love with this place and left us scratching our heads. \u00a0So I don't know if this review is very helpful. \u00a0I do know I've had paella before that was much better than this. Good luck.",
