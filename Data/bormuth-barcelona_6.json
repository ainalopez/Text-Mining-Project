    "Vermouth was really good.Not sure why people gave the eggplant and honey chips high reviews, it's soggy eggplant chips that are sweet. \u00a0It was good, but not great.Spinach with pinenuts, yummy! \u00a0Overcooked a bit, but that's OK, it was still very good.Fried fish (sardines) were good. \u00a0Too much for an order.",
