    "You would think that a great Mojito for 3,5 Euro is not possible, but this man can do it! He mixes you an awesome Mojito for a very good price! It has everything it needs + the special ingredient you normally use on Cuba. You can feel someone here loves his job. The flavored alcohols in the cupboard make a great impression and the Nachos with Guacamole have been good, too. I would gladly come back here anytime.The food (65%)taste ***** (5)look ***** (5)ripeness ***** (5)price ***** (5)-The location (20%)cleanness **** (4)ambiance **** (4)atmosphere **** (4)-The service (15%)friendliness ***** (5)flexibility ***** (5)attention ***** (5)total: **** (4.8)",
