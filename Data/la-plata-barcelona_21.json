    "My love affair with Barcelona started with La Plata and is an example of simplicity done right. I would jump on a plane, travel 15 hours, clear customs, and navigate the alleys to have lunch here again.Menu? What menu? Don't worry... you don't need one. All you need is an old guy behind the counter that points around at what other people are grubbing on and then you tell him how many you want. The selection is simple, but it's exactly what makes La Plata great. We started with one of each... key word, started.The sardines. Oh lordy, the sardines. Lightly floured and then fried. We ended up with three plates of these and inhaled them like french fries. The salad. Salad is a term used loosely with the tomato, onion and olive oil served on a small plate that cuts the sardines perfectly. No greens on this \"salad.\"The sausage. Very good but in my eyes it just stole room in my stomach from the sardines.The baguette. Rubbed with tomato and olive oil. It's done all over the place in Barcelona and really makes you wonder why something so easy and delicious isn't found more often in the U.S.The wine. Served in small half bottles with juice glasses you have your choice of the red, white or pink table wine. We had all three and sitting next to a local regular tipped us off on the best way to enjoy it. I can't remember what it is called but it looks like a small glass tea kettle full of wine. You hold it up to your mouth and then pull back once the stream starts. Extend your arm and drink as the wine flows and you are now doing as the locals do.",
