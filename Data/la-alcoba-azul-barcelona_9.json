    "After a week in Barcelona, finally found the BEST tapas bar that includes the ambiance I always expected- \u00a0the challenge in Barcelona is finding a tapas place that is not so over-salty that the flavors sort of all taste the same: \u00a0salty! \u00a0La Alcoba Azul is fantastic- and tucked away on a quaint side-street that can be hard to find, but way worth the effort. \u00a0And the staff are tremendous, funny, and so very fun to just see them enjoy their work (especially Carmen- very friendly and super helpful!)- \u00a0best dish of the night was the stuffed red pepper with cheese (sorry, forget the name) that just melts in your mouth and flavor-punch with every bite. \u00a0Lots of locals with a smattering of foreigners and always appears busy. \u00a0We will be back!",
