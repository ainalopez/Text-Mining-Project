    "OMG! Get the beef! Any way it comes, just get it. We loved it. Ikibana is trendy, elegant, amazing to the eye and ear (dj cooking her music with sushi chefs:), just perfect. Our waitress Beatriz was fantastic . The food always came with a smile and some info about how it was prepared. Great to go with a small group so that each person can order something different for everyone to try. So many great options on the menu.",
