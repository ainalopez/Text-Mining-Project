    "I created a yelp account solely to write this review. I have traveled many places and been to many restaurants, but Gilda has the most unique, creative, delicious food I have ever had. We ordered at least half the menu items family-style with a large group and every single thing was mouth-watering good. We ordered two more plates of the shrimp with curry ice cream because it was so unbelievably delicious. If you visit Barcelona, you HAVE to try this restaurant.",
