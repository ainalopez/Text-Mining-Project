    "I've only been here once on my very memorable visit to Spain and Barcelona. The main reason I came here was the fact that it was owned by the Dos Santos family. Its in a fairly quiet place in Barca and since it is new, it seems like a good location to take a date or just to relax with a few friends.Honestly, I had a great experience here. They started us off with this very interest hot shrimp soup apparatus, that had us wanting more. It is supposed to be a \"true\" appetizer.I ordered the chilaquiles and they were amazing. Truly a mixture of aesthetic and tasting pleasure. Overall, I would say that it is a bit pricy, but it was overall good experience and I would not take away a 5 star rating. If I head back to Barcelona, then I will most probably visit here for some chilaquiles and the mystery shrimp soup, which I would probably consider a secret menu item.",
