    "Be sure to walk in most Northeastern door. \u00a0This place is huge and somewhat confusing to get seated if you miss the host. \u00a0That said, this really is the Rolls Royce of microbreweries, at least aesthetically speaking. \u00a0There are two standard beers on tap, the Moritz and the Moritz Epidor. \u00a0I'm more of a fan of the original Moritz which reminds me of a German Kolsch but get the Epidor if you like something a bit darker. \u00a0Don't leave without going downstairs and seeing the cavernous brick fermentation area. \u00a0The food is outstanding with choices ranging from Spanish tapas to well executed pub fare. \u00a0Overall, one of my favorite experiences after 11 days in Barcelona.",
