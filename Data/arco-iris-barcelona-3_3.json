    "It's not easy being a vegetarian in Barcelona. I yelped veggie restaurants and was delighted to find Arco Iris a few blocks from my hotel. The food is very flavorful and service is prompt and efficient. The menu of the days allows a choice of a starter, veggie, entree and dessert. \u00a0All are small plates and very filling, and extremely affordable for $9 Euro. The biggest challenge was my high school Spanish wasn't enough to help me communicate with the staff. Fortunately two young women who spoke English at the next table helped me with the menu. Based on what I saw coming from the kitchen \u00a0I would've been happy with any of the choices.",
