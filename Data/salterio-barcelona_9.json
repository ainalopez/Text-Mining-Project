    "Excellent little spot to hide from the rain and enjoy a warm drink. They make chai tea from scratch so that was awesome. Overall I'd say it's a great place to go if you're in Barcelona for a while and looking for a quaint spot for an afternoon. Or you're in the old side of town and want some respite from walking and visiting shops and churches.",
