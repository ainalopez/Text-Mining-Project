    "A promise of a good experience. Down to earth trendy decor, excellent service, exquisite tastes. Pricey but not overly as you feel you are getting everything you'd expect in return. The attention to detail is not characteristic of Catalan service culture but here you even get a stool to put your bag on and there are plenty of waiting staff ready to serve at a gesture of a hand without hovering over you. They embody a Mexican flavor yet they add that extra taste which is the signature of Ferran Adria's chains of restaurants.Allow yourself at least two hours to get through their tasting menu - which they cater to your preferences. Many options are gluten free or can be customized. Their flavored water drinks are truly awesome and well priced. You can order a la carte too, but picking dishes won't be easy. Either way it is a time well spent!Looking forward to our next visit...",
