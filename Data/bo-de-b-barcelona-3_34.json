    "soooo unexpectedly amazing! A friend recommended this place after studying abroad in Barcelona. Just wow. you would never expect to have one of the best sandwiches ever when first seeing the restaurant. It's a small joint that doesn't even have any seating or large interior. It's small and gets packed. The line can also get soo long but it is deff worth the wait. You basically make your own sandwich but this is no \"subway\" type of deal. The meats, sauces and variety of veggies are numerous. My boyfriend and I got two sandwiches and the patatas bravas . Still one of the best bravas I've ever tried because of their unique spin on them. We also loved how it's right by the beach so you can just grab a spot anywhere and chow down. Great find!",
