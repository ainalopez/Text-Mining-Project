    "A romantic little Italian restaurant, hidden in the alleyways of elBorn. It doesn't feel like you are even in the restaurant. It's so charming and the service is so warm you feel like you are visiting a good friend's house for dinner. The menu changes daily and presented to you on a chalk board. Our lovely waitress went over every item in detail. We shared burrata salad and both had a main course.The serving is very generous so keep that in mind. Everything was flawless - a perfect spot for an intimate date or a great dinner with friends/family.",
