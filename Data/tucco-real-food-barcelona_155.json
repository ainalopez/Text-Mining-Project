    "This place was a little hole in the wall that had us worried at first. However it was definitely worth the walk. It was cool area to walk through and were greeted by a friendly man who spoke English well and took time to explain the menu to us. We tried the burger, salad, spaghetti, and the house special pistachio ravioli. It was all delicious and a good amount of food. We also had a spinach and a beef empanada as part of a special in the meals. They also include a drink, bread and a desert with most of the options. They also had five different deserts and we tried all of them. They were delicious and had my little cousins licking the spoon. It was well worth it to walk to this area after L'Aquarium and go though a little back area of the Gothic Quarter.",
