    "This place was out of this world. Our guide recommended this restaurant to us as a great culinary experience and he was so right. The price for our entire dinner and bottle of wine for the quality and preparation of the meal was unbelievable. I would go back there every night if I could! We arrived around 8:30pm and were the first people at the restaurant, which I didn't mind because we got some special treatment :) but for people who want some other people at the restaurant dining as well, I would suggest getting there after 10pm (it's Spain! Everyone eats late).The waiter was so nice and prepared the steak tartar we ordered table side. My husband ordered the prefix menu and I ordered a la carte. His starters were so delicious, I'm so glad I got to taste them all! The strawberry gazpacho was mouth watering, the tuna carpaccio was so interesting Ive never had it prepared that way. There were about 4 more small starters as well (including eggplant tempura and shrimp scampi). Will definitely be returning to this gem when we're back in Barca!",
