    "If 'La Trini' had been a person, it would have been a person who has her/his finger in too many pies. A newly opened locale next to Verdi Cinema is strangely a hot spot for cinema-goes. Who would know. But I bet there will be more customers to come to enjoy a evening hang out on a glass of wine and cocktail. What about food? The question is : What do you want? A carb-rich food like a burger and fried eggs? Pica pica style with \u00a0good selection of tapas dishes? No, you are a patatas bravas fan, which flavor do you prefer: Classic brava sauce, Pesto sauce, or Yucca? \u00a0How about a random pick from the menu? \u00a0A black rice with ali oli and salmon tartar with avocado sauce? The bottom line is that they offer a wide range of different cuisines that will certainly please you.",
