    "One star for the cute ambiance and one star for the very friendly staff. Unfortunately, the look of this place doesn't match the food. I ordered a wok dish with Thai sauce -- it was the blandest Thai I have ever had... it tasted like all coconut milk and very little curry... and it was marked on the menu as being spicy... there was ZERO heat! In my dish, I had the shrimp -- they were dirty little shrimp that you could actually see the black line of their digestive tract. Eww! I couldn't eat them. My husband also had a wok dish... he got the \"spicy\" sauce... it had some kick to it but it was just heat and no flavor. All-in-all, we were very disappointed and won't be returning.",
