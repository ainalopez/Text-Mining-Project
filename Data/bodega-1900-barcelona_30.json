    "Picked this place knowing I will not be able to get into Tickets Bar, so want to give this a shot.Started with the house vermouth. \u00a03.75 euros each, tasty!Our server was extremely attentive as we ate early at around 1pm. \u00a0She recommended a few dishes to us and it really worked out.We started with the olives.... OMG they are revolutionary! \u00a0It made our trip to Barcelona worthwhile.The cherry tomatoes in olive oil paired really well with the shredded ham dish - it was match make heaven.Croquetas was light, airy and delicious! \u00a0Meat pie was excellent as well. \u00a0To finish off we had the melon soaked in vermouth and vacuum sealed for a few hours. \u00a0Devine!If you are a foodie, pease come check the restaurant!",
