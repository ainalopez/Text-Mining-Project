    "So many Tapas places to choose from. Yelp helps. \u00a0Wish I was the 100th review. \u00a0I want to write a lot, but this place deserves a more to the point review.Here it is:Bar area, high top tables, back room with a ton of room. Setup is perfect and the service is direct or super friendly depending on who you get. The kitchen is in view and as you watch things get prepared it's hard not to get pumped about your food coming.So here's the bottom line. Every single thing we had was f-ing delicious. Period. I'm pretty positive I'll revisit them a couple more times before I leave. Ordered and pictured:Sprout Salad with Parmesan cheese and fruit Asparagus tempuraDressed potatoes with salmon and wasabi (unbelievable)Iberian ribs with honey and mustard (soft and falling off the bone)Broken eggs with butifarra sausage Catalan cream foam Again- EVERYTHING was amazing.",
