    "Just down an alley off the main waterfront. Advertised as Basque food. Gave off a bit of a pub/tavern vibe from the outside. Quiet, comfortable and friendly atmosphere. Staff was very friendly and enjoyed talking about the region and culture. As we finished one small plate, we just kept ordering more from the menu. Food was simple and very good. Probably our favorite place during this trip. Definitely recommended.",
