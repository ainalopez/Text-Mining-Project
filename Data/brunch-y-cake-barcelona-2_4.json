    "My favorite brunch place in Barcelona! Everything is just so delicious and cute!There's normally a line up so be prepared to wait. Apparently the best time to go is around 7pm (if you're still up for brunch around that time). I had their mango salad with chicken, avocado and greens. And my friend had their eggs Benedict on a shovel! The smoothies in a jar is also delicious as well. I was too full to have their cake after eating but they also look amazing!",
