    "We saw this place as we were walking to our hotel. It was right across the street from our hotel, so we made a mental note to check it out. On Saturday night, we very stupidly didn't think to make a reservation. When we arrived at 8pm they were fully booked, however could accommodate us if we wanted to sit at the bar. These were great seats, and you didn't feel in the way of the bar staff or ever the wait staff. We ordered 5-6 dishes and a bottle of sangria. The food was amazing, everything was so fresh and tasty. I highly recommend ordering the tomato and tuna. It was the best dish i had during my stay at Barcelona. I've never had that many different types of tomato. YUmmmm.I would highly recommend checking this place out. Its great value for money, although i would make a reservation if you intend to eat here for dinner, to avoid disappointment.",
