    "Great Thai place. Food came quickly and was delicious. Service was good and pleasant. Loved the coconut curry chicken and both the mango coconut dessert and the coconut ice cream were out of this world (I do love coconut, though). Sweet and sour chicken was also nice. Would definitely recommend this place.",
