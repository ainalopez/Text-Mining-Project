    "Found this restaurant on Trip Advisor. They have a couple of locations. Since we were heading to La Sagrada Familia, I planned lunch nearby. Our appt for the lift up to the passion tower was at 130pm. We headed there afterwards. It was 1 block east past burger king on a small street. What to do?1. Pick out your seafood. Prices are listed per kilo2. They will ask you how you want it cooked. Grill or tomatoe sauce.3. Order drinks, breads, salad, sauce. Everything cost money. 0.50 euros per each small piece of bread. 0.80 euros for dipping sauce. Beer is pretty cheap. 2.70 euros. They have wine too.4. They give you a number. Grab a table. Your number will be called out when its ready. Pick up your food at window.Seafood was pretty fresh. Had one bad prawn like item. I think its called ciga or cliga. Overall good. I had a better meal the day before at la boqueria near la rambla.Would recommend but I prefer the other place. It's more fresh and tastes better.",
