    "I love this place. It is the first restaurant my wife brought me to in her home city. It is perfect for groups of people. Note that they are only open for food on spanish hours, but the bar in the front is open for the duration with excellent bocadillos and jamon shaved right off the bone. \u00a0The decor is always fresh and beautiful. The restaurant serves all fresh food from the market it is tucked into. The menu is a little different than the norm. It is a cross reference table of food prep styles on top and types of food along the side. You choose what style you're in the mood for, then the food and voila! You have options. All food is typical Catalan of the area and the wine selection is fantastic. The wait staff speak multiple languages and are friendly and helpful. The market and restaurant were renovated into a very modern design by one of the most inspiring architects I studied, enric miralles. This is a perfect stop for foodies and inspired \u00a0architects alike. Enjoy and bon parfit!",
