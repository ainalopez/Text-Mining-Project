    "This small restaurant down the street from the Picasso museum serves amazing food and drink. \u00a0We started with sangria and tomato bread. \u00a0I usually do not like red wine but the taste of this was delicious. \u00a0We ordered three tapas and a dessert which was plenty of food for two people Appetizer: ham croquettes- smooth mashed potato rolls with ham that are quickly fried. \u00a0Crispy outside and creamy inside. \u00a0We had one each but they were so delicious I could have had another 2nd: grilled leeks- small tender pieces of leek with olive paste and drizzle of olive oil. \u00a0These were unbelievable. \u00a0The taste was like nothing we have ever tasted. \u00a0 3rd: iberio ribs in honey. \u00a0Think extremely tender short ribs that melt in your mouth with a sweet glaze. \u00a0These were by far my favorite until we got to dessert. Dessert: Cremoso de chocolate con pan. \u00a0Smooth creamy chocolate with olive oil and sea salt. \u00a0Spread the chocolate on bread toasts and eat. \u00a0By far the most delicious dessert we have ever eaten and we love dessert!It is fun to watch the owner, Daniel, work his magic in the open kitchen. This was truly the best tapas restaurant that we have ever been to",
