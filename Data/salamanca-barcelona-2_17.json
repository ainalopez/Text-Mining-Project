    "I don't know where the best paella is at, but we tried it here and another place, but neither of us four were satisfied!We tried the black noodles, seafood paella and meat paella, but all were just ok. \u00a0We spent a ton here but probably only ate half the food. \u00a0Sigh.They were friendly servers, and we had some complimentary alcohol to wash down our food, haha. \u00a0Oh, and the red sangria was just ok...",
