    "This place has really good food! I had the grilled mushrooms with asparagus, patatas bravas and a piece of sirloin. Everything was really lovely, freshly prepared and tasty. The plates were so big that I couldn't finish my three tapas although they were so delicious! The next time I'm in Barcelona I'll be going there to try a few more of those lovely tapas. So if you're looking for a nice place with heavenly food and good service go here!The only thing I disliked is that it's really crowded in there. Every table was taken although the restaurant opened a minute ago. it was really loud and narrow in there. There also was a long queue when we left - but the food is definitely worth waiting for.",
