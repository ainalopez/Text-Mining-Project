    "I've been coming to this small family shop for years! This small friendly family shop has been serving locals and visitors alike. With its proximity to the Sagrada Familia, stop by and enjoy a sweet treat! They have churros with all kinds of fillings, dipped in chocolate, or served with a hot cup of chocolate. If you're in the mood for something more savory they also fry their own potato chips. If you see them frying churros, I definitely recommend buying them hot out of the oil and taking it into the park across the street from the Sagrada Familia. It's a great way to enjoy a treat while experiencing one of the wonders of Barcelona.",
