    "Ciudad Condal is essentially the sister to Cerveseria Catalana, offering the same menu and same ambiance. It gets packed in the evenings, but you can grab a drink while you wait. The food is always good, very reliable if your bringing visitors to try tapas! My guests from the states were always pleased and had a good experience with tapas in Spain after a visit to Ciudad Comtal! \u00a0Their Camembert with almonds is a must try.",
