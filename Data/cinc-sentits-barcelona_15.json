    "This was an amazing experience. I did the eight course tasting menu and wine pairing. To date, this is the most expensive meal that I've ever eaten and I wasn't disappointed. The atmosphere, the flavors and the presentation were stellar. \u00a0If you're looking for an elegant dining experience, then this is the place for you.",
