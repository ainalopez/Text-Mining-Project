    "I don't bandy around such a title lightly. This place was delicious. We went twice, once for tapas on the chance of getting a table, and once having booked for a more sizeable meal. Both times were utterly delicious and service was cheerful and excellent. The tastes were unique and mouth watering and the cheapest wine was lovely too. I hate olives but my fianc\u00e9 informed me even they were superb. Our visit to Barcelona was enhanced by these meals. We will remember them for a long time. Gracias",
