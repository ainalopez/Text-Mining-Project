    "Our first night in Barcelona, we so thankful that our Spanish friend took us here to eat. What an amazing introduction to the amazing food Barcelona has to offer! We ordered several small dishes (tapas) that we could share among the three of us. Please order the Bombas, they are, as their name describes, the bomb! Patatas bravas, chorizo and mortilla were among the other dishes we shared and all were wonderful. For dessert we shared Crema Catalonia and it was to die for. You will not be disappointed at La Bombeta.",
