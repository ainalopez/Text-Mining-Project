    "This was our last meal before leaving Barcelona for Madrid and I'm glad to report that Arume did not disappoint. Luckily being from California meant that we tend to eat dinner early so when I was told that the only reservation available for the evening was at 7 PM, I was happy to oblige. This was Spanish fare done at its best using their local fresh seafood and at a very reasonable price. The only annoying thing was we were told that we could only dine for an hour and a half to accommodate other reservations and was reminded of this by the manager (I'm assuming he was the manager) shortly 7 minutes past our deadline. We were looking at the dessert menu and just decided not to order anything else since it felt like we were quickly being ushered out. Oh well, it was still a fine dining experience even though they are located in a sketchy alley near Las Ramblas and you were expected to swallow your food instead of chewing it first.",
