    "Long line out the door. Every night. That's a good sign, right? Very noisy and crowded. And still worth it. We were lucky that we could share a table with some others. I walked to the bar to look at the food. When I came back...here's the conversation:L: When you were away, I ordered 2 more dishes. And I don't know what they are!Me: Huh?L: But they are good! Yeah...when you were away, the waiter came and said there are 2 hot dishes coming out the kitchen. And they are goooood. Do you want them? So I said yes!AND they are good! One of them was really really good: pimentos and meat. So...when you're there, and they tell you there's something coming out the kitchen, and it's good...ORDER IT :)",
