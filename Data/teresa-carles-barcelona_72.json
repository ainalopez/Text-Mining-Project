    "I finally tried Teresa Carles, and it certainly lived up to my expectations! \u00a0Full disclosure - i was invited to an event where we were treated to a special menu, for a Sunday brunch... so i don't know the prices. \u00a0But the flavors - excellent! \u00a0And the service was exceedingly friendly. \u00a0If you have the opportunity to ever try their Veggie Eggs Benedict (poached egg atop a bed of sauteed spinach with shitake mushrooms, caramelized onions) - served on a whole wheat english muffin - GET IT. \u00a0It was so good. \u00a0Same with their assortment of muffins and the banana bread. \u00a0Presentation was beautiful, service was great, ambiance was lovely... I'm sure the prices are on par with the quality. \u00a0Definitely worth a visit.",
