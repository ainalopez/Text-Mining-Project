    "Raw fish in BCN? I was skeptical going into this but was desperately missing Japanese food. The writing on the walls about how this is an experience for your being didn't help the case...however, this is legitimately a good place. The quality and freshness of raw fish is present, the rice is cooked correctly....They have little dispensers of soy sauce and soy sauce with wasabi already mixed in.The only con is the pricing. ~5 euros for a temaki (like a bigger handroll...2-3 times the size of a regular hand roll?) is a little steep especially if you're trying to get full off these. So...don't come here to do that. Come here if you're missing a little taste of home.",
