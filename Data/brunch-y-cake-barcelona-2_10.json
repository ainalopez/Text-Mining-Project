    "Literally everything and anything on this menu will blow your mind. A very quaint, hipster restaurant located in a very cute neighborhood only a few blocks away from the main streets. Ordered the ricotta pancake with fresh fruits (including passion fruit and kiwi!) on top, and also caramel popcorn and flower petals. Served with amazing chocolate sauce. The consistency of the pancake was more similar to a bundt cake. Very rich and fluffy, but a light enough flavor to amplify the flavor of the fresh fruit.Ordered a scrambled egg on the side that was also phenomenal. Next time will definitely order one of the bagel or sandwich dishes! Acai bowl was also intriguing!",
