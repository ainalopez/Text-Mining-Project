    "This place is so good in terms of freshness and value, we came here TWICE during our vacation. The bocadillo sandwiches for \u20ac3.50 are a bargain considering how much meat (choice of chicken, beef, salmon) and toppings (corn, tomatoes, onions, olives, lentils, cucumbers, red peppers, green peppers, red cabbage, lettuce) they piled into the bread submarine. They top the sandwiches off with an array of green, red, and white sauces. The plates entr\u00e9es are large deconstructed versions of its sandwiches and range from \u20ac6-7. Come hungry, because the plate portions are huge. Note, they do not allow take outs of the plates. There are only five tables so the line for sit down can be long. We waited about 45 minutes for our table, but it was worth it. The takeout line can wrap around the block but it moves fast. Try to go during off-peak hours.",
