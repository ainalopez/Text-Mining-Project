    "This restaurant is the best tapas place we have visited during our week long stay in barcelona for many reasons:We had an array of tapas which were presented on an English menu, luckily, and the service was very friendly though there was no clear ownership of the outdoor tables between the servers. We had the breaded Brie with quince jam (amazing), cheese plate, steak veal with Argentinian paste, Kentucky chicken (which was actually delicious, though a tad greasy for my taste), tuna tataki, focaccia with shredded duck, and a bottle of cava. Plus 2 desserts and coffee our bill came to a very reasonable 72\u20ac. The atmosphere was lovely, it's off the street away from the noise down a little pedestrian only alleyway. Right next to the barcelona seminary actually. Lots of locals at the place sitting outside and chatting with us, really made for a wonderful experience and the food was the best we have had as far as tapas in BCN. Come here for something out of the norm of what's usually served in tourist bars and you won't regret it!!!",
