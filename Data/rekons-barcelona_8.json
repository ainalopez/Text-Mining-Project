    "Good but really slow service keeping in mind the number of customers and the size of the restaurant. Venue has a certain, simple charm to it. The empandas were good and there were many to chose between. Generally there was a bit much bread and not a lot of stuffing. My favourite ones were chicken with plum and bacon with goat cheese.",
