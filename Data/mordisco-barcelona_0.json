    "I'd gone to a children workshop at La Pedrera (definitely material for another review) with my niece and nephew and their parents. We really just wanted to find somewhere for a quick bite, and I happened to remember had seen El Mordisco in our way there, so we went.I used to go there in their former location, somewhere at the other side of Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, many years ago. I had good memories of their creative salads.They sat us at the patio (covered now for the winter), told us about the specials, and got the kids and their mom (6 and 4) for a little tour to see the Christmas Tree and other decorations. Choosing what to eat was a challenge, everything sounded really appealing so once more we relied on suggestions.After lunch they let the kids choose their dessert; we ended up trying most of them; they are home made, simply delicious.They made us feel very welcome, food is great and service was impeccable. Not only I'd seriously recommend it but I'm very much coming back.Bon profit!",
