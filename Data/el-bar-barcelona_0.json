    "Upon arriving in Barcelona, we were looking for a great place where we could start our vacation right with some good grub and a bottle of good Spanish wine. \u00a0We definitely got that with El Bar! \u00a0They speak English here, the space is inviting and the food was pretty spectacular. \u00a0I know off hand that we had the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and mussels. \u00a0We had some other stuff but I am still suffering from vacation brain and seeing and eating at too many different places making it hard to recall every item eaten at each place. \u00a0I am not sure what the upstairs has going on, but we sat in the spot right where you walk in both times that we came here. The food is a good value here... portions are the perfect size for tapas if you ask me, and the wine is fairly priced. \u00a0We enjoyed it so much the first time, that on our final day in town, we had to come back again. \u00a0One of the best experiences that we had in BCN. \u00a0I encourage anyone who has not been here to check it out!",
