    "I went to this restaurant a few months ago while I was traveling in Barcelona. I was slightly let down by the cuisine of the area, but I cannot say that about El Bixto. I can't even write a proper review because, looking back, it is difficult to recall words that can adequately describe the overwhelming sensations that accompanied my meal. Subtle and exquisite flavors and wonderful ambiance; the kind of meal that will make an emotional eater cry. The menu (sheets of paper everywhere that I didn't understand) was pretty much impossible for me to decipher, but just ask for suggestions and it will surely be superb. El Bixto is one of my fondest memories of my numerous months spent in Europe. Good luck finding it, but persevere.",
