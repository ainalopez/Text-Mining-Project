    "The dishes here are fresh, creative and absolutely delicious, blending Italian and Mediterranean tastes. The kitchen is open so you can watch as the chefs grab ingredients from the counter, and craft the dishes. We ordered a bunch of the dishes to share, which I highly recommend doing so you can try as many as possible. The cauliflower and the gnodi were exceptional, but I didn't love the pizza. The service is excellent.",
