    "Sitting here having desert...tapas were mediocre. Comparing to cerveceria Catalana, not even a comparison. Stick to the basic tapas anything with sausage or seafood not that great. Sangria is good at least it masks all the things that don't taste good. This place was meh. Don't come here. Not worth the price.",
