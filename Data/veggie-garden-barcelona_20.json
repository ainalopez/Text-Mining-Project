    "We stopped in this place during a rainy day in Barcelona and warmed up at a table on the second level. After looking through the menu, my guy and I both settled on the daily option and went with the Thali - which was wildly delicious and filling. The daily menu is comprised of a drink, starter, main dish, and dessert. And there are three or four options for each, all for only \u20ac8.25 - which is a straight up bargain.Service was a bit slow and the menu is way too large (120 options) (!!!!!). Also, they offer free wifi but it did not work.",
