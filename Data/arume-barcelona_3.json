    "This restaurant is simply amazing for its food!We decided to go there because it had great reviews for paella. But I was distracted and wanted to try other things on their menu. The drinks started off as a pleasant surprise. I ordered the recommended blackberry Mojito and it's simply amazing! It has crushed berries on the bottom and tastes very fruity. Other friends who ordered wine were impressed as well. I ordered the lamb dish, and it's very tender and melts in your mouth. The paella isn't the traditional style but rather have their own twist. You can choose either seafood or meat version. The dessert was amazing! That's probably my favorite part. The cookie is served in icecream on a bed of cream. Wow!On a side note, the restaurant has a small window on the floor. If you look down, there's a skeleton on the bottom of it. I couldn't quite figure out the meaning of it. But it's pretty cool to see.",
