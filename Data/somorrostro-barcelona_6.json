    "Awesome! \u00a0Yelp delivers again! \u00a0A must while in Barcelona if you are a foodie or mildly adventurous diners. I am \u00a0mildly adventurous, and my wife will try anything. Service was great. Small restaurant. Cool decor. Great feel of the place. Extremely fresh ingredients. Every element from ingredients to preparation to combinations to presentation were fabulous. We ate:Saut\u00e9ed Wild mushrooms, blue fish with quinoa & mushrooms, cod fish brandada with ratatouille, flat bread with tomato. All spectacular! \u00a0Deserts - apple tatin and tartlets with quince. Both were scrumptious. I am taking a very happy girl home tonight!",
