    "I was staying in the trendy Born neighbourhood of Barcelona, and decided I'd try a restaurant which had not been reviewed yet on Yelp, so I happened upon Nou Cellar after getting lost on one of the many windy small streets.The restaurant itself has a warm, welcoming feel to it. The waiter who served me spoke English, though the service here wasn't anything particularly memorable.After claiming a table in the lower section of the restaurant (which turned out to be 'just' safe, considering the rafters were only an inch above my 6'3\" frame), I asked for a glass of Sangria and a Catalan Omelette to start, and the Paella for a main.Lets start with the Sangria - someone told me after my visit that if a place served you Sangria by the glass, it most likely came out of a carton. This definitely didn't taste like it had been freshly made (but still cost a few Euros).The omelette was.. and there's no really kind way of saying this.. dull. Probably the most boring omelette I've come across - it wasn't particularly large, didn't have many ingredients in it and was just.. boring. I don't know if that's just how a Catalan omelette is, but a little imagination could have gone a long way.And then the paella. Well, the rice was crunchy. Quite frankly, if you've not bothered to cook the rice for long enough, then the entire paella is going to be a write off. Disaster.I opted not to stick around for dessert. When the bill came, I noticed that IVA (the sales tax) wasn't included in the menu prices, and had been added on as extra on the bill. Note that this is also a pretty bad trick that the 'lesser quality' restaurants will try to pull on you in Spain.Overall, steer clear. Born has many other much nicer restaurants to try out.",
