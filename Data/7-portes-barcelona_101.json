    "Older restaurant with beautiful decor. \u00a0Wait staff was attentive and very professional. \u00a0Food was good, not great. \u00a0Paella was disappointing. \u00a0Our only real disappointment in a week of otherwise amazing food. \u00a0Suspect more of a touristy type place than a real foodie spot.",
