    "This restaurant has a really cool atmosphere in a slowly growing popular area. In terms of the food, don't bother with the chorizo. They taste like mini frankfurter links. Nothing special. However, the ham croquettes were great, and the seafood paella delicious, although saltier than I would have expected. I will say I was a little disappointed with how little seafood was in the dish. Two exactly of each type of seafood option, so much more rice than anything else. Don't be surprised that you get charged for the bread and water, and the service was on par with Spain. Slower, but no complaints. Definitely worth checking out while in Barcelona. Fun small place with a cool, intimate atmosphere.",
