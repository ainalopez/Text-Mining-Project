    "This was the perfect place for a great inexpensive meal in Barcelona. \u00a0Of course the beer was worth coming for on it's own, but did not expect how delicious the food. \u00a0First were the Nachos, big portion with tortilla chips that were home made....my daughters each ordered the Fried Pork Ribs (half portion)....WOW!!! probably the best deal going. \u00a0Also ordered the Pot Stickers which were good. \u00a0My wife had the Ox tail soup and absolutely loved it. \u00a0I ordered the Chicken Sandwich...the only disappointment of the night. Just a thin piece of chicken on a lot of bread. Should have ordered one of their burgers 'cause the table next to us ordered one and it was big and juicy looking (especially compared to my scrawny yardbird). \u00a0If you come and just get some ribs and beer you couldn't go wrong!!",
