    "This place completely lived up to the hype! We had to wait almost an hour to get a spot and our food on a Wednesday afternoon. We ordered huevos rancheros, baked eggs, dirty latte and cafe con leche. Everything was amazing and perhaps worth the wait. Downside, they were out of orange juice and service was too slow. I think they need more servers considering how busy they are. But definitely you should go!",
