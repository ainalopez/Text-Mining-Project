    "What an amazingly fun and delicious bar! It is set up in a typical Basque style where they have cold tapas out with toothpicks, you pick what you want, and are charged 1-2 euro per toothpick after you are done.My boyfriend and I stopped here for dinner on our last night in Barcelona and honestly wished we found it sooner. We shared a bunch of different tapas and had the best time. \u00a0We also tried some of the hot tapas that came out after the kitchen rang the bell. Everything we had was absolutely the most delicious tapas we had during our time in Barcelona. \u00a0The hardest decision of the evening truly was to stop eating because it was all that good. We also enjoyed 3 glasses each of the house wine. And the wait staff here was so warm and welcoming. They really made it feel like you were in a neighborhood spot and you were all old friends.And if this place could get any better our bill came out to about 18 euro per person.We would be here all the time if we were locals but what a fantastic way to end the trip.",
