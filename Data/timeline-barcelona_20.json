    "We came here for Sunday brunch, but they offer it Fridays and Saturdays too. Awesome meal, the pancakes were almost better than any I've ever had, and the mimosas are bottomless during your meal. 15 euros for a huge two plate meal, coffee, orange juice, and endless mimosas. The decor is fun, sort of like eating in Wonderland. Great meal, and I'd love to try their weeknight drink deals and tapas.",
