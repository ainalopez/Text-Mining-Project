    "I love this bubble tea place. From the shop decorations and the accents of the staff, I think it's run by Taiwanese people. It's always nice to find authentic food outside of home. The couches at the back of the shop makes it really comfortable to chill here after a walk around La Rambla. Also, like most Taiwanese boba places, you can choose the sugar and ice level. I feel that 50% sugar with less ice is just right! Personally I love the normal Zenzoo milk tea with oreo toppings. If you're a regular, make sure you get the buy 10 get 1 free card!",
