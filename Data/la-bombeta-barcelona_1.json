    "It's surprising how there are these inexpensive but great restaurants just one street away from the waterfront. La Bombeta might seem like an unassuming spot, but their food was truly delicious!We tried their mussels with marinara sauce, garlic prawns, grilled small squid, and grilled artichoke. Everything was tasty! Their sangria is sweet but quite strong at the same time. I'll definitely go back!",
