    "Easily the best dinner my friends and I had in Barcelona! We had the guacamole with chips which was delicious. We ordered fish tacos and chicken fajitas and some drinks (mango mojito and strawberry daiquiris) everything was perfect. The prices were reasonable as well. From the food to the atmosphere in the restaurant it was a cute little place to eat, I would highly recommend it.",
