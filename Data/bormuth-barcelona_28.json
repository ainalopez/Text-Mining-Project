    "Pretty good tapas, but not exceptional. Everything was decent to good, including the prices. The secreto iberico was pretty interesting and tasty, as was the jamon y manchego. Boquerones and tortilla espa\u00f1ola were not bad. The fried pimientos de padron were pretty good. Patatas bravas were fine. It was a bit difficult to get attention in terms of service, but servers were nice enough and food came out pretty quickly after ordering. Cute place with a local feel and local food.",
