    "Everything we had was so delicious. We came here on our third day in Barcelona and the first two days were hit or miss with the food! I kind of gave up on finding fresh, delicious tapas until we stumbled upon Tapeo. Must try!!! The staff was so friendly and helpful! Great wine recommendations as well.",
