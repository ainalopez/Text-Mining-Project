    "I was recommended this place by a friend who is used to go to very trendy and pricey places and so on. We had to wait a bit to get a seat as the place was absolutely packed (and it was quite late to have lunch, 3:30pm or so...) but the staff was really friendly and the feeling was great. The decoration is amazing, packed with stuff and paintings and pictures in every single corner. Music was 60s/70s/80s - ish and clearly American, even the waiters and waitresses were singing with the music! Since it was so full, we had to wait a bit to get our order so you better go before you are starving and in need of food inmediately :).I ordered Caesar salad and BB Delux Burger. The salad was very good but since Im a great fan of this salad, I must admit it wasn't mindblowing, but still really good. The burger was way better, tender and juicy, just as a perfect burger should be. My congratulations for it to the chef!!We were so full we didn't dare ordering some dessert but they were all tempting!!The only non-positive point I found was the tipping policy like in the US, like encouraging slightly too much for customers to tip the service as \"it's not included\", personally I think it should be included and wages of the staff should not depend on tips (but that's my personal opinion :P).Will definitely come back soon!! :)",
