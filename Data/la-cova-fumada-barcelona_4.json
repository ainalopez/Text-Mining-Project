    "Stopped by La Cova Fumada for lunch after taking a stroll on La Barceloneta. This place is definitely a hole in the wall as there is not even a sign above the restaurant..how did everyone else find it/know what the restaurants name is? There isn't even a hard copy of the menu inside. It can be very hard to find it if you're looking for the name so just trust the google maps location..I walked around the block a few times and finally accidentally walked in. Everyone who works here is extremely nice and always has a smile on their face and a welcoming vibe. They know their food is delicious.The waiter listed popular menu items but I ended just going to the front with him and pointing to a display in the front of what I wanted. We tried the bombas (the best potatoes I've had in Barcelona..just the right amount of spicy - very spicy), octopus with onions, razor clams, spicy artichokes, and codfish with kidney beans. Everything came quickly and was amazing! The only complaint I had was that everything was very oily, which can make my stomach feel a little queasy afterwards.The restaurant itself is not that nice but the people and good food make up for it. Come here for a satisfying bite near the beach!",
