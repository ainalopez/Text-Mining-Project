    "What can I say... I truly love all the patio options in Barcelona! Amazing. So we were about 15 hours from NYC, finally checked into the hotel, needed some really food, water, and drink. Like the other reviews, we picked Tapa Tapa because of the proximity... Feb in Barcelona was perfect! And our waiter... sure put a smile on me face with his jokes of how we sound... American's among the Spanish - Now I know what it feels like to be the opposite. LOL - None-the-less I enjoyed the peppers, tortilla, ham and wine... Wanted to go back but had sooo many options, and going back to stalk the waiter would have to wait until I move there... :)",
