    "La Pubilla was the best meal we had in Barcelona!They don't speak much English, it is a neighborhood gem in Gracia. \u00a0They are full every day for lunch, so always call to make a reservation first. We called morning of, and got a 1:30 reservation (their first table time). \u00a0It is lunch only, and a $14 euro three course meal. \u00a0There is also an option for a 'fancier' entree for $17 euro.All meals come with a free glass of wine!The food was spectacular. \u00a0We also had a vegetarian and they made everything for her veggie friendly. \u00a0She LOVED it just as much as the meat eaters.We had soup or pasta as our appetizer, hamburger as an entree and apple tart or ice cream as dessert. \u00a0I'm not describing the food as well as I should because it was spectacular. \u00a0The seasoning was perfect, the flavors were exciting. \u00a0As an American who speaks little catalan, we were taking a risk with the menu and we were so happy we did. \u00a0We had no idea what to expect after we ordered and it was all phenomenal.Of note: Takes credit card, reservations REQUIRED",
