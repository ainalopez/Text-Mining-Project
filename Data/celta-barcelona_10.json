    "Stopped by on a whim since the original place we were headed to was closed. Turns out, this place is in the Lonely Planet book!Here's what we ordered:-octopus: didn't try but it was the most expensive item on the menu and it was quite chewy and \"not worth it for the price\"-mussels: delicious and in a spicy sauce with diced onions-chorizo: tasty but overly cooked and salted-olives: too salty-shrimp: fresh-tuna empanadas: okay... wished it was served a bit warm rather than cold-bread with tomato: delicious when dipped in the mussel broth-croquettes: don't know what was inside (cheese?) but I could have ordered more!The bar is in the front and I guess you go around the bar looking at what they have. We sat in the back room (non-smoking area). For those doing tapas in Barcelona for the first time, they don't offer wines by the glass so when we ordered their popular white wine (Reboreda), we were presented with the bottle and even though we only wanted a glass and told the waiter, we were still charged for the entire thing.Service was a bit gruff. Not sure if that's a European thing and/or because we were tourists. The price for all that food was about $71 EU including drinks.",
