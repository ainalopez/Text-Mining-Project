    "We went here after a recommendation by our AirB&B host. This was one of the best meals we had in Barcelona. The seafood paella was delicious, fresh, and not overly sauced . Tasted like it was made to order (as much as any restaurant could possible make it) and didn't taste regrilled/reheated as some other places we ate. Good for the price and plenty of food. We still ate every grain of rice because it was so good.",
