    "The dinner we had was absolutely one of the best we have had so far on our European adventure(we are on day 12). First, they brought out delicious complimentary bread with olive oil in a test tube and a selection of olives, followed by goat cheese croquettes which were amazing. I ordered the arums paella which was absolutely filled either seafood and so delicious. My husband ordered a similar style dish which was rice with duck and mushrooms in a delectable brown sauce. After our two huge dishes plus the appetizer, we couldn't possibly have dessert, although they sounded amazing. Everyone around us ordered incredible looking cocktails as well. \u00a0With the check, they brought us each an aperitif of something that was similar to baileys Irish cream but way better. Overall one of my favorite meals of all time.",
