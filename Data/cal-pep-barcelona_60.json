    "While a bit touristy, it is a must in Barcelona. \u00a0The waiters make the experience very entertaining and the tapas is 100% Barcelona.The flash fried peppers and the little fried fish with eggs were delicious as were the croquettes. \u00a0The only downside is the majority of the menu are fried dishes. \u00a0It was a fun experience for the entire family and got my boys trying a lot of new foods - including sardines.",
