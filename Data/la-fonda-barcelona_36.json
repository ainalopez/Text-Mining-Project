    "I'd give the food 4 stars but the low prices earn it a 4.5. Good service, good food, excellent sangria. I had the pork loin \"Bonet\" as a main, with a wild mushroom sauce. My partner had the roast lamb that came with melt-in-your-mouth roast potatoes. My only wish is that the chocolate sauce used for their dessert crepe with ice cream (and the same on their creme pastries) should be a little less like Hershey's syrup if you know what I mean. Not sure if that's what they used but it sure tasted familiar.Don't waste your money on the crap Food on the Las Ramblas boulevard. Seek out the gems on the side streets like La Fonda.",
