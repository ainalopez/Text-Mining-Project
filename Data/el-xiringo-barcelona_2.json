    "Have a seat in this tiny restaurant tucked away in the streets of Barcelonata and prepare to have your mind (and tastebuds) blown by the city's best-kept secret: Chef Xavi.This was easily the best meal we had in our 8 days in Barcelona, and quite possibly the best meal we've had, period. This guy knows seafood, and he knows exactly what to do with it. Put your fate in his hands, and watch the man work. It's like a getting private, culinary concerto from Stravinsky, and in a city renowned for its edibles, you'll soon discover you're in the presence of a living maestro.I could give you the specifics - clams in a rich, creamy garlic broth, cornmeal-encrusted calamari that melts in your mouth, and a seafood paella that had us scraping our plates - but why spoil the fun?Go directly to El Xiringo, and see for yourself. And if you're still reading this, shame on you - your food is getting cold!",
