    "Great food! We has the bombas, \u00a0chorizo, ham croquettes, bread, Catalan sausage and peppers, beer, coffee and dessert for two people for 35 euro! The food is awesome, great tapas selection, very authentic, and totally with it. Most may walk past it, but the food is fantastic and so reasonable. \u00a0Definitely will visit again!",
