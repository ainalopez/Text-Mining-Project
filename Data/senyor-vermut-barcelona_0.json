    "Super Cheap & Tasty....We tried to get into O Retorno, but there was a line out the door; always a good sign, right, except we were hungry. Stumbled upon Senyor Vermuts just a few short blocks away.Service was great (our server spoke english- bonus for us), menu is available on chalkboards in the bar. Food is tasty and came out quickly. We had an order each of - mussels, clams, potatoes, and another interesting fish dish (thinly sliced, smoked/cured with some almonds sprinkled on top) and of course Vermut. Note: How it works - \u00a0You will need to find a spot to claim, the sever will stop by and leave a number with you and take your order (by this time, hopefully you have had had a chance to review what is on the chalkboards). Once you have had your fill, take your number to the bar and pay... its that simple.Enjoy....",
