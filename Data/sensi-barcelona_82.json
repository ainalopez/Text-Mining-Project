    "Stop looking for little holes in the wall!! This is it! We ONLY went there because of our Yelpers said to and man, were they all right!!!! The ambience in there is perfect. Lit candles, warm colors. Nice waiters. Our wine bottle was 18Euros! The tapas were out of this world! Duck with potatoes, and the potatoes with spicy sauce on it! The best I have ever had. My wife hates duck and she just loved this. I was shocked. The main meal was steak and I ordered the risotto. They were perfect in every way. Didn't add any salt, everything was perfect. I highly recommend you go here. I want it again, but I just got back to Germany! :(Tip: the notes say there is WIFI. There is NOT. That was a bummer, but we made it work.",
