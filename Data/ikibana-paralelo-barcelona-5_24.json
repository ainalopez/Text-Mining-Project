    "This place was absolutely amazing. Got an outside table for two with my wife. Very friendly staff, amazing cocktails too! The food is such an interesting mix with the japanese and brazilian influences together, it was truly a great dining experience. It's not the cheapest place to eat out by any means, but it was our nice night out on our 3 day holiday and we enjoyed every euro spent!",
