    "The bread was stale which negatively impacted the flavor and texture of all of their tapas. \u00a0I was really expecting something great but was very disappointed. \u00a0The anchovy tapas had so much lemon on it, it tasted soapy. \u00a0The crab tapas were flavorless. \u00a0The only ones that were decent were the smoked salmon tapas.",
