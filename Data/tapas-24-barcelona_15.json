    "Outstanding Tapas bar. They have limited sidewalk seating but if you're willing, venture downstairs to the restaurant and sit at the bar. You'll enjoy great service and a wonderful selection of tapas that features a daily rotation of specials. Try several items but be clear on quantity or you might get a lot of food. Oh, and the Bikini Sandwich is a must.",
