    "After striking out at another tapas bar we had wanted to visit previously, we ended up at El Xampanyet after a long day wandering around the Gothic quarter. This place is tight, and it gets packed at night - we ended up at the back, squished into a tiny table for 2. Frankly, I don't remember much because the guy who got us seated gave us 2(!) bottles of house wine (probably because we were clearly tourists), and since my fiancee is not the drinker in this relationship, I had to show my interpretation of politeness and down a full 2 bottles. Fun times indeed...Aside from that, though, I do remember that the food here is absolutely delicious. Although one might question the facilities (I took a look around the corner while we were shimmied up against the wall waiting, and the back area where there's a stove looks pretty much like how a regular kitchen at a house would look like), the tapas that are churned out here are great. There's a set amount that you can order, but you can add on if you do want to eat more.This is a really fun place to be, and if you're the sociable kind as a tourist, you'll probably find people to chat up - I would say the majority of people that were here on a weekend night were tourists of one variety or another, so this won't be a restaurant where you feel awkwardly out of place. Don't come too late, though...otherwise, you may find yourself waiting quite a while to get seated! It's worth the wait, though, because your perspective on tapas (if you're a non-Spaniard) will probably change significantly after you've been here, and for the better.",
