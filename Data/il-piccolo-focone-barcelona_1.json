    "Okay, so eating Italian food in Barcelona seems a bit weird, but surrounded by foreign food I wasn't sure was celiac-friendly, I was desperate for some gluten free food, no thinking or explaining required. Il Piccolo Focone fit the bill. A bit of begging and a twenty minute walk from our hotel later and my mom and I found ourselves at this amazing little gluten free haven. I found this restaurant using my Find Me Gluten Free app, and it absolutely did not disappoint! When we walked in, a server immediately asked if one or both of us was gluten free. Almost everything on the menu could be made gluten free, including the pizza and pasta. After more than a month in the not-so-gluten-free-friendly city of Paris, I was DYING for some pizza, and this one was the most authentic, delicious one I've ever had. The crust was still sprinkled with fresh flour, and the floppy thin pizza spilled over all sides of my large plate. My mom would not stop making fun of how happy I was, but what's better than a huge gluten free pizza?! I would have come back here each night of my stay in Barcelona, but my non gluten-free mom wasn't too thrilled with the Italian food in Barcelona concept. After multiple other less gluten-friendly restaurants (and a few reactions) I really wished I had! Seriously, if you're celiac and in Barcelona, come here. If you're visiting the Sagrada Familia, it's just a short walk away!",
