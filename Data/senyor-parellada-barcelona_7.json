    "As a first time visitor to spain, I was extremely displeased with how this place treated tourists. \u00a0First, be aware that nothing is free. \u00a0The bread and wine they rush to your table without request both cost money. \u00a0Second, after having drunk the tap water in Barcelona for a few days and not having a problem with it, I asked our server for \"agua del grifo\" (tap water). \u00a0The server said I could not have tap water, only bottled. \u00a0When I clarified why i could not have tap water, our server explained that the tap water in all of Spain was contaminated and it was against the law to for him to serve it. I suspect this a tourist only policy. \u00a0Finally, the bill was in catalan and had to ask my server to clarify a few lines on the bill. \u00a0We were charged for wine we didn't have (another trend I've noticed in Spain - check your bill!). \u00a0Our server begrudgingly fixed our bill and was all too happy to see is go.I spoke spanish, and spoke politely. \u00a0The attitude of this server seems endemic of the rest of Spain. \u00a0They want tourist dollars, but don't want to provide the appropriate service to earn it. \u00a0It's as if by virture of being Spain, tourists owe them money. \u00a0Despite Rick Steve's recommendation, avoid this place if you're a tourist.",
