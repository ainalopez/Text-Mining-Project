    "Saboc serves food according to temperature, and describes how the food changes taste and texture when cooked in different temperatures. A cool idea. We had the medium tasting menu, and the food was really good. But we were left kind of hungry, so if you like to eat - order bigger menu is my advice. The price was not to bad either. The interior is really cool with Nordic inspired decor and colors. Service was very good.",
