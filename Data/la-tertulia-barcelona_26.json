    "On our first night in Barcelona, we were not sure where to eat and wanted to walk. \u00a0We checked YELP and found La Tertulia. \u00a0Great atmosphere, friendly staff and ,yes frequented by police. \u00a0 Food very good and to the individual that suggested the camembert with raspberry suace, you were right! \u00a0 \u00a0My husband is a picky eater and demolished his beef steak. \u00a0 It is also reasonably priced.",
