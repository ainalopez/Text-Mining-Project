    "This place is absolutely gorgeous inside. The most beautiful restaurant I've ever eaten at. The Asian and Moroccan theme in Barcelona tickled me so much (I am Asian, Moroccan AND Spanish). Great location on the beach. The sangria is delicious and gets you feeling nice! The sushi is some of the best I've ever had. Love this place. Worth the price. Go early before the crowd starts and watch it full up with a \"trendy\" \"hip\" crowd as the DJ starts up. A highlight of my European vacation.",
