    "Went there last night with a group of 5, got two steak dinners and a few starter dishes which was more than enough for all of us. The food was excellent and the service was even better! It was a fun environment, our waiter was very interactive and helpful at guiding us through the menu. I would highly recommend it, may go back once more before the end of my visit!",
