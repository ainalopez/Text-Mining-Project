    "I have been to Barcelona a couple of times because i have family here and this review is from my last trip that i forgot to do when i was last there before my daughter moved to NYC. Els Pascadors is by far the best seafood restaurant in Barcelona we made a dinner reservation which would be my recommendation because a lot of the locals go to eat there. Ask what the Chef's specials are because you might want to order from them since they get fresh fish in and they prepare it a very creative manner rather then from the regular menu. The menu will still be great to order from but i still think you would be smart to go with his recommendations; I ordered the salmon cooked in special seasoning with rice which really looked more like paella to me. We had appetizers, salad and sangria to drink. Let me tell you the Sangria in Spain taste nothing like the wine you would have here in USA, this is amazing red wine and it compliments the fish dinner.",
