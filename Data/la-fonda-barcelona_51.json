    "A nice restaurant with always a long queue in front of the door. Nice and friendly asian service, with good quality catalan-style food. It's just right in the center, it's a very good choice if the queue is not too long, even if usually it goes fast, as they have many tables. Try the catalan creme...That's really awesome..",
