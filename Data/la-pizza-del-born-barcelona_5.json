    "Omg I'm so lucky this restaurant is an ocean away. Otherwise I would be there once a day. This is by far my favorite pizza ever. \u00a0Im not normally a fan of crust but this one is so crispy yet light- i don't know how they do it but it's amazing! \u00a0And a huge selection of toppings. And speaking of amazing, their sangria is one of the best I've had. You definitely get your money's worth. The Born area is very interesting, and I know there's lots of competition for pizza. But the staff is friendly and the food is just so good!",
