    "We had the 8.5 euro menu which consisted of 3 tapas and a drink. Quite a good price. However, most of the dishes we had were either sloppy or boring. The patatas bravas were really boring, and the tomato bread was not crispy. So, even though we were full and the price was decent, this was not a success. In addition some of the staff was really rude and inattentive.",
