    "If you are looking for great tapas away from the touristic restaurants - That's the place to go - Food is really REALLY Great! But the service is very slow - I had to ask for my drinks at least a couple of times, the waiters are like model type, pretty skinny tall girls with short shorts and club make up. They prob get hired based on how they look \u00a0and not on how well they do their job! But hey the food is GREAT!!! If I have to ask for my drinks 3 more times I will do so. :-)",
