    "I've been here a few times (for lunch, for dinner, for dancing) and have always found it to be the most attractive of all of Barcelona's high end beach restaurant-clubs. It's decor (Asian-esque) and attentive staff are probably the biggest pluses for me-- there's none of that sluggish or snobby service you can get at the other beach restaurant-clubs around here (I'm looking at you, Hotel W). I also only have good things to say about their steaks, though their vegetable dishes are overpriced. Drinks are awesome, also pricey though. I know a lot of people reviewing here don't dig the hostesses, but I'm a fan. They have a way of looking classy and attractive without the whole thing being excessive (unlike some other places). It's an awesome place for a special occasion, especially if you want to dance afterwards-- and I particularly recommend it in the summertime. However, be prepared to spend a lot of money.",
