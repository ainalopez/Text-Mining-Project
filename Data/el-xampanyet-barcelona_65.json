    "This was one of the first places I stumbled on to while vacationing in Barcelona. It was so good we ate there a total of four times in a week. So \u00a0amazing! Classic tapas, great atmosphere. Heck Chef Albert Adria of Tickets and El Bulli says this place if great. One stand out for me was the atun' con queso. OK tuna and cheese on a skewer marinating in olive oil sounds like it shouldn't work but they make it something amazing. Also they have a great house cava. If you're in El Born and looking for a nibble, this is one of a few places you have to hit. Cheers",
