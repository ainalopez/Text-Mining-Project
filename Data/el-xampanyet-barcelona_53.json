    "Muy delicioso!Located on the busy side street of Carrer de Montcada, this little gem is popular with locals and tourists alike. To find your way here, just follow the signs to the Picasso Museum, because it's just down the block.We ordered:- mejillones (mussels)- esp\u00e1rragos (asparagus)- Boquerones (anchovies in vinegar)- At\u00fan (tuna)- Potatas rellenas (potatoes stuffed with sauce) - Salmon, pescado blanco y tomate (salmon and white fish) - toastada de sardinas con pimento (sardine toasts)All of it was quite tasty. We were planning to just have a little snack here, but seeing all the delicious food behind the glass at the bar, we couldn't stop ordering. Our \"snack\" came up to 60 Euros, which is almost $90. Of course we ordered drinks: cava y cerveza.",
