    "Truly enjoyed the dining experience here, it gives you what Spain is about with the modern, artistic ambiance and that signature sexy Spanish lighting I love how The wine reccs were on point, really appreciate when a restaurant connects you with the exact type of Vino you want and they did.The dining experience was not rustic by any means and not super refined - I like when restaurants go in the middle.The two must orders, the Salmon Tartare is next level and 1 of the Pepito sandwiches is on GOAT level, the one with Brie and Fig Jam or something like that was a table favorite.Everything else was well done.Might've been the best restaurant we had all week there, so many good ones.P",
