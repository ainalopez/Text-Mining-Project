    "A classic restaurant and a bit touristy, but it's a fun atmosphere and the service is truly stellar.We started with calamari, anchovies, and fried peppers (small and green, very mild, no heat).I had the squid ink black rice which came with creamy aioli on the side. \u00a0It was hearty and filling, and the aioli was a great touch with the rice and squid bits.We split a creme catalan for dessert, not too sweet with a pleasing crunch.The piano is a nice touch but sometimes the selections are a bit \"elevtor-y\" but that's part of the charm.",
