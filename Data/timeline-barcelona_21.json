    "A hidden little gem in the neighborhood of Gracia. \u00a0Great place for brunch on the weekend or for an evening of wine with great tapas at a reasonable price! Mojitos are nothing short than delicious! On Mondays they are only 3euros! Then to top it off the staff is extremely friendly. When I was living in Barcelona this was a weekly must for my friends and I. Whatever you do try their yummy vegetable spring rolls...delicious!",
