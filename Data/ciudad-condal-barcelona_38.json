    "This place was fantastic! We went Easter and were able to snag a seat outside. We had the prawns and clams. The prawns felt like butter in your mouth. The clams were so nicely seasoned and tasty! They had some decent bottles of beers to choose from. The bottle of Rose we had was the perfect blend of sweet yet very refreshing. Staff was just fine.",
