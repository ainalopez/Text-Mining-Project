    "I would have gave 5 stars but we went today to order our usual chicken burger and surprisingly they changed its receipt...also the fries were not as good as usual and the service not really friendly. We can clearly feel \u00a0 that they can't follow the rythme during summer pick and have to lower the overall quality. I will try again after september and give them one more chance because i usually love this place",
