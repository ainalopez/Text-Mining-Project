    "(Check out my Arume review to see how we ended up here.)We ate at Cera 23 on a Saturday evening as a group of 6 starving people. We ordered 3 appetizers from the menu including: octopus (great), ceviche (good) and burrata (nothing special). We then proceeded with 2 different risotto plates which our companions claimed to be salty and seafood paella for the rest of us. Seafood paella is full of seafood and seasoning/color/spices just complemented the entire dish to perfection. I can easily eat that dish every day for the rest of my life, it was that good. I also ordered the famous Blackberry mojito, which looked and tasted like a tropical vacation. Thank you for the hospitality and the mojito Cera 23!",
