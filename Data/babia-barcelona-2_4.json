    "What a wonderful restaurant. The wait staff is so helpful, the wine selection is fantastic, and the food is phenomenal. Our waiter chose our meal and wine for us on my birthday and we were not disappointed! We came back a few times to have wine and Babia now has a special place in my heart. It has this authentic, homey vibe to it and everyone there seems to be having a great meal with even better company. I can't wait to go back!",
