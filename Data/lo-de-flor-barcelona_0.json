    "Thanks for a great evening! \u00a0 Daughter and I were only ones when we arrived 930pm, but by the time we left it was hopping. \u00a0Warm, lovely service (thanks Carla!) \u00a0- we were right at home, fun time with the staff. \u00a0Super food - loved the tartare, the straciatella, steak milanesa, etc - dessert too (the \"rock trio\" - just get it). \u00a0 It was cute to see our favorite waitress from prior night run across the street to Lo de Flor for something, hugs and kisses all around - that's the kind of place this is (not to mention great food). \u00a0 Thanks - definitely get over to see them -",
