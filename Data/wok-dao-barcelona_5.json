    "woahhh! this place is almost as good as the seafood buffets back in california. don't be deterred by the chinese grill bar exterior; we never would have eaten here if our host hadn't recommended it. it seems like mainly only locals eat here, and for good reason. you can eat all the fresh seafood you can at dinner for 11,95 euro. the selection is huge, ranging from salads to fried stuff to a whole leg of ham you can slice from to chinese-style seafood and even raw stuff that you can take to the guys at the grill for cooking. the only downside was that the teppanyaki was REALLY heavy on the oil and some of the pieces were overcooked. i'm sure you could talk to them about it if you speak chinese or catalan.tips:eat slowly.don't fill up on rice or noodles. you can get that any time.stay away from sushi at buffets, if you didn't know already..don't drink too much.EAT SLOWLY.fill up on the pricey good stuff like lobster and oysters. you have to take them quickly, though! other people will swoop in.don't eat too much, the price is so good that you will probably eat your money's worth in one plate. it's not worth it to get sick afterward.the best bits were probably lobster, little clams, freshly cooked fish (the white one cut in half), razor clams, and all the big lovely shrimp.",
