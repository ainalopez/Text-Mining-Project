    "Visited Pinotxo early in the morning but the cooks were still away. They were just serving croissant and coffee. I was advised to return at 8:00 and I was able to snag a a seat at 8 easily. I ordered the veggie omelette which has potatoes and onions. I agree with the other reviewers. The food was very very salty!!! I was disappointed. This bar is very accessible from the street as it is in front of the boqueria. \u00a0the owner is very amiable and personable though. I just wish that they minimize the sodium in their offerings. Could not order the xuxu as they were not delivered yet.",
