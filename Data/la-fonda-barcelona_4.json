    "Not what was expecting when I walked into the nicely decorated and centrally located restaurant. They had a price fixed menu which had some interesting options. We ordered from that menu and were not impressed with the food, although it wasn't bad. The real issue with la Fonda has to be the service. The service was dry and not very attentive. Definitely not what I wanted my first restaurant in Barcelona to be like.",
