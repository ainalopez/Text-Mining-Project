    "Having a nearby dance business means my friends are frequent customers here. They know the staff and the staff knows them. My friend talked about their sandwiches and how she enjoys having a salad and sandwich here. I followed her lead and tried the 4 Queso salad and the Dorado sandwich.The queso salad was great with the cubed cheese and mustard seeds sprinkled throughout. It wasn't as biting as I thought it might. The sandwich was great. I ordered it mainly because it had dates inside. This restaurant certainly has unique touches to their food. I like that about them and might find myself returning before I leave Barcelona.",
