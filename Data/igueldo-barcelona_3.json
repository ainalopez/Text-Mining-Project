    "This place is on the pricey side, but we knew about it before we went. \u00a0We decided to try something we don't usually eat, like blood sausage, veal tataki, they were very good. We also ordered croquette, squid and duck, everything was super delicious. Service was great. Decor is very modern. \u00a0The most important, it is Clean! Highly recommend this place.",
