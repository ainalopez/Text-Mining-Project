    "Cal Pep came highly recommended by friends. It was a good, solid tapas meal and we enjoyed eating several seafood dishes here. I was disappointed with their potatas bravas - but their calamari and mussels were really delicious. I will admit, I was a bit turned off by the length of the wait for here and I could go elsewhere for good food without such a wait -- but I'm happy I waited to experience Cal Pep. It's solid, good cooking. I'd go back, but there were other places in Barcelona I'd go back to before here.",
