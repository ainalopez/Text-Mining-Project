    "Went to Luzia since we walked by it a few times and it looked good. Nice, casual place (we ate dinner around 6 one night and late, not by Spain standards but by mine, one night). The grilled asparagus w/romesco sauce was quite tasty! We tried a pizza and loved it. The guy who made it came over to check how we liked it and shook my husbands hand when he learned how much we enjoyed it. The sangria was SO good (the traditional - the while/cava was a bit too sweet for me). They have heineken on tap. Service is friendly (menus in english are available) but not the speediest.",
