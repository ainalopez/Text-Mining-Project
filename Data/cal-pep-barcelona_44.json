    "I went to Cal Pep based on a recommendation, today.Below is my honest assessment.First of all the customers should be treated better. We waited for \u00a01 hour to be seated. No one seemed to even notice the level of frustration for all of us. For those who made reservations, they were still standing waiting for a table. There were bugs that had attached themselves to the vents and ceilings. The staff seemed frustrated and the chef kept yelling at them. The wine glasses were dirty. The food was good but not fantastic. The food in France and Italy is superior and cheaper. My advice is to speak to the locals and get recommendations, tourist restaurants are usually overpriced and based on hype.",
