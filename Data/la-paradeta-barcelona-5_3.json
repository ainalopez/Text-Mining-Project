    "Amazing experience, great seafood, so fresh it still moves when you select it. I have been pointed out this place by a friend who knows Barcelona quite a bit and I cannot thank him enough. We have been there twice during our trip and we loved the food and the atmosphere a lot. The place is full of locals and outside the city center I think this is the best sign for a restaurant already. Highly recommended!",
