    "I\u00b4ve read many many reviews about this restaurant and I was really thrilled and excited about tasting their great tapas on the first night in Bcn, I even had all the tapa names in my iPhone of all the recommended choices from other reviews. I ordered:Pastel de Pato (Duck Timbale): it was excellent, I really appreciated the succulent pulled duck, simply delicious and to die for!!!Croquetas de Jamon: not the best I\u00b4ve ever had, probably one that has never tasted a croqueta de jamon before can tell you is delicious but I\u00b4ve had the Cuban version and is much betterPatatas a la Brava: It did not wow me, it was just squared fries with a spicy cocktail sauce on top....I just wanted to know what the fuzz was about when other people ordered this tapaMini Burger: it was a salmon burger which was ok, did not wow me eitherLangostinos with Chutney sauce: just 3 jumbo skewer shrimps with some really salty and dark soy sauce noodles, it was the worse than the ones served in any of the Chinese fast food restaurantsTHE WORSE PART OF THIS EXPERIENCE: PAELLA, it was the worse rice with seafood I\u00b4ve ever tasted in my life and believe I am Asian and I know about Rice! The so called Paella was too salty, runny and the worse part is that the rice was raw, the rice inside the Mussel was just raw and uneatable, maybe for birds and other animals raw/uncooked rice is digestible but not for humans. My boyfriend and I left this place sick and wanted to throw up. Before arriving to Bcn, my boyfriend was just thinking in eating Paella every day but this disgusting so called Paella left him really sick and took away any desire to eat Paella ever in his life. Only the Sangria and the Duck Timbale was good, the rest....eat at your own risk",
