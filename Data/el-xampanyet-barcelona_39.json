    "Grab a glass of wine from the bar, then be assertive and on the lookout for a table. Once you're seated service is pretty quick, food is amazing, and the Cava is cheap and delicious. Staff seemed pretty bi-lingual across the board, so if you're terrified by the all-Spanish menu they should be able to help you out.",
