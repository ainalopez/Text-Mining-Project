    "There is a reason why this place has so many positive reviews. \u00a0It's worth it. \u00a0It busy all day long and it moves at a good pace. \u00a0We had the Eggs Benedict and Turkey Waffle. \u00a0The taste was delicious. \u00a0The service was even better. \u00a0We were in Barcelona for one week. \u00a0We had great food through out the city. \u00a0This was just amazing. \u00a0If you are near the Ramblas area you must try.",
