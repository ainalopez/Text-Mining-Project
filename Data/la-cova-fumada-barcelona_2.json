    "This is a hidden gem in Barceloneta. No sign outside but a long waiting line let's you know something good must be happening inside. And it definitely is. Great family atmosphere, super friendly service and some of the best Tapas in the city.I've been coming here for years with both family and coworkers and La Cova never disappoints. Carles is always eager to recommend what's best and you should trust his advise.",
