    "70 Reviews, 4 stars and a half and lives up to it as well. Lining up a few 4 and 5 stars places was really helpful during our time in Barcelona. I feel the places we have been to were well worth the ratings, keeping service on the side as it is on the slow side, BUT it looked to us as a local way of doing rather than anything else. This place is a little off the beaten pass and we went there after taking the tourist bus that stops at a plaza near by. We came a little late and service was at its down time. We were seated right away and this place is perfect for groups as you have plenty of big tables. It feels very typical. ENtering the place makes you look at a loong row of pinxtos to help you decide after you sit down. We tried the croquettas, bacalau croquettas and jamon, grean peas and veal, pork in sugary sauce, as starters and we stopped there as the sizes were not accommodating us and switched to larger plates : burgers. To be honest, very not typical but filling. It was 4pm and we needed that. Very decent meat quality. I feel we did not explore the large variety of the menu if front of us but we wanted a break and it was a perfect place for it. I would like to go back to it and focus on tapas and especially pinxtos as they all looked very nice. Service was always, a tiny bit slow but again we were off normal hours. Oh and try the Barelonina beer, it is one of the best bottle beer I had in Barcelona.",
