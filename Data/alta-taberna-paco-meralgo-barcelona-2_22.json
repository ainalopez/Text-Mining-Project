    "WOW - is all I can say.Paco Meralgo was recommended by my sister's boss who is a bigtime chef in NY/Boston. Needless to say, it did not disappoint!We started with with the beef tartare montadito and it was just incredible - it's smallish but the perfect size and the beef is super fresh and perfectly seasoned.The pan con tomate is out of control here - do not skip on that. We also ordered two types of croquetas, the chicken and the squid ink \"obama\" ones. I would pass on the chicken but MY GOD - the squid ink croqueta is literally one of the greatest things I have EVER put in my mouth. Absolute must.We also had the grilled calamari, which is very tasty and comes with beans that give the dish a nice touch. Another star of the night was the Solomillo filet al ajillo - basically filet mignon drenched in garlic and butter. I wanted to cry tears of happiness when I took my first bite. You must order this.We finished off with a crema catalana and it was a nice touch! Great wine selection too.If you're in Barcelona - YOU MUST GO HERE!",
