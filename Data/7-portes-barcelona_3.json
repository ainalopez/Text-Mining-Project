    "This was the highlight of the last day in Barcelona after visiting Montjuic castle earlier in the day. \u00a0Thanks to google maps - we made it to this restaurant.What a treat to have the seafood paella. \u00a0Perfectly cooked rice with the grains being separate from one another. \u00a0Flavorful with the various seafood incorporated incorporated into the dish - mussels, clams, scallops, and prawns to name a few. \u00a0Nothing like the mushy globs of rice without definition that I have had at other places.The house wine was great. \u00a0Crispy, floral, dry - perfect for the hot weather.The steamed mussels was amazing. \u00a0Something so simple done wrong a most places - leaving an overcooked, rubbery, chewy item. \u00a0Not here. \u00a0Their muscles were tender and juicy. \u00a0It was cooked with attention and love.",
