    "Let me say it outright that Tickets Bar is not a place to fill your stomach. Its a place to enjoy food for your soul and mind. I have been fortunate enough to visit this place twice in 6 months. Whats so special you would ask, well you need to book 2 months in advance and even after looking for weeks you may not get the date you are looking for as the slots gets filled in few minutes. During the first visit we let our friendly server decide the food. The result was a tasting sample of almost every small tapas they had to offer. The liquid olives came first and whoa! It pops right in your mouth exploding your senses - what food can do to your mind! Everything right from mini airbag to Confit artichoke to LOLA' orange was mind-blowing! The server explains you each tapas in detail. Behind the counter we could also see the chef meticulously cutting and weighing meat like a craftsman. Sure enough, Its an expensive place but if you are into gastronomy experience, you MUST try Tickets! I am going here again on my next visit to Barcelona!",
