    "Wow. Simply fantastic in every way: - Ambiance - Relaxing atmosphere, breezy cafe with great music playing.- Coffee - The best cappuccino I've had in Spain, so I ordered a second at the end of my meal.- Food - Everything about my meal was in perfect balance - The eggs were perfectly cooked, salted and peppered to a wonderful flavor, fresh avocado slices, roasted tomato, rustic bread, all over a lovely bed of mixed greens. Hearty enough, but light enough, and healthy. - Staff - great service and nice people. One girl even wrote down the music that was playing for me so I could check it out later. Definitely going back before my trip is over!",
