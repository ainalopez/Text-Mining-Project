    "Very good \u00e0 la coupe pizzas, with ~10 different flavors (plus 1-2 dessert pizzas). All pizzas are fresh, and the 4 we tasted were excellent. You can eat them outside on their small terrace (no additional charge for that). You eat wayyy enough when paying \u20ac8-10 per person, so it is also a good deal in this quite expensive neighbourhood. Only downside: there are only 2 waiters and their organization is sometimes sub-optimal, so you might end up spending a good 15 minutes ordering your pizzas - don't go there at peak time if you are in a hurry!",
