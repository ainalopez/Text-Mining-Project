    "Very good food and service! Lovely place, cute and homie feel. Very relaxed atmosphere. The tenderloin with foie gras was delicious. Risotto and muscles a little salty for my taste but otherwise very good in taste. The tomato bread was delicious though, best one I have had in Barcelona so far. Definitely a place I will come back to. I would recommend this place. European style:)",
