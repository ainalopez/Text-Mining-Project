    "Just okay. Service was very slow and they never checked in to see how our food was or if we needed anything else. My son's food arrived way before mine and he was finished before mine ever came out. I went for the paella, but was not at all impressed. Was really hoping for an authentic Spanish dinner but left feeling rather disappointed. We had to wait for a 9 pm reservation, but the place appeared to be able to accommodate us much earlier (far from crowded). On the upside, the sangria and house salad were delicious and attractive and my son loved his grilled chicken. The prices were certainly reasonable.",
