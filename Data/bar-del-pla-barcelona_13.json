    "Staying around Las Ramblas, it was pretty tough to avoid the tourist traps and find good food, which was surprising. It wasn't super cheap, Bar del Pla provided the best tapas experience I had in Barcelona. Traveling by myself gave me the advantage of showing up to the most popular places without a reservation and setting myself up at the odd seat at the bar. Couples and groups ahead and behind me were all getting turned away. Though I loved this, I didn't get to try as much as I wanted. I got the squid ink croquettes, tuna tartare and tomato bread. I know I didn't get very creative, but I had been sucked into so many terrible places (wasn't using Yelp enough), I was grateful to have delicious, basic tapas.I hope to return to Barcelona, and I will definitely try to come here again.",
