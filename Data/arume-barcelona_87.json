    "Went there last night based on recommendations and ratings from Yelp and were not dissapointed at all! It's all true - attentive and \u00a0friendly (young and beautifull too) staff and great ambience. \u00a0Food was excellent. We came for paella specifically, had burrato salad and \"tirradito\" salmon as apperizers, paired with nice bottle of wine (well thought out selection of those). \u00a0Hope the owners/management will be able to keep \u00a0all that quality up till our next visit to Barcelona, because we'll be coming back!",
