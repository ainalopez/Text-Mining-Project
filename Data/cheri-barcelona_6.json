    "Service A+ Food quality A Price vs value A+ Ambience & Design A+ so in short well worth a visit. To be fair the food choices are diverse and plentiful and close to A+ and it was quiet so no issues with pace of service. This is a very nice space with decent prices and a very good execution of the three dishes we tried. Top marks all around. Would return (may return).",
