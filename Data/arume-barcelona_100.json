    "I know it is \"UnYelpy\" of me to give 5 stars, but this place deserves it! No, I don't work here...I'm just a guy from LA who loves good food. The wines were perfect, the octopus appetizer was the best interpretation I've ever had. My wife had the lamb entree and I had the pork. Both were absolutely incredible. Service was amazing. Bravo chef and staff, you hit a home run!",
