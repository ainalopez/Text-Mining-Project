    "Dinner at Ikibana was the absolute highlight of 2 weeks in the south. \u00a0I can say with confidence that it was the best restaurant we've been to so far this year. \u00a0Everything about it was perfect - the weather, the table, the staff, the food. \u00a0We had the salmon ceviche, asparagus, S\u00e3o Paulo Way Uramaki, Bruce Lee Spicy Maguro Tempura, a couple of nigiris and the Wagyu Entrecot. \u00a0If this restaurant doesn't get a Michelin star in the next year or two I'll be shocked.Absolutely add this to your list if you head to Barcelona.",
