    "Okay, first of all, I'm a moron and didn't realize that \"tortilleria\" didn't mean tortillas (as we know them in America)...it meant omelets. So that was a surprise, but we didn't really mind.Read about Flash Flash in a Lonely Planet article (I think), and decided \"Hey that sounds like a fun place to eat.\" It's super retro & 60s inside, lots of black & white paintings of women holding cameras on the walls. The waiters are super dressed up but they all speak pretty decent English to help out the gringos.The food was very good (not great but very good...we were happy) and we enjoyed the experience there. Would go back again upon a future visit to Barcelona.",
