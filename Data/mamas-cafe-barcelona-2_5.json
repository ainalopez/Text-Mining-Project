    "Wonderful organic food, a friendly waitstaff and an adorable back porch. I had the eggs on greens which ended up being more like a salad then I thought, but they were super fresh and delicious. My friend had the spinach omelette which was amazing! Great coffee, bread and croissants too. I would have loved to eat there every morning! They speak a little English too.",
