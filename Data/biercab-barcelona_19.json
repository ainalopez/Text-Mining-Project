    "It is a nice and chill place to grab a good beer with a wide variety. I came by myself with a book grabbed a delicious burger and 3 beers. They played great music so I just wanted to stay and chill for a bit. The staff was super nice and quick to service (It was a Sunday so they weren't super busy). I'd heard about the place a while before and finally made it out, and know that if I had gone earlier I would have probably been back at least once a week. The atmosphere is really nice too!",
