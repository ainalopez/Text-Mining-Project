    "It has been two years (?! so sad) since I visited La Tasqueta de Blai and I still dream about it. \u00a0 If I could teleport anywhere in the world right now, it would be back to Barcelona to visit this little restaurant. The pinxtos are all fantastic- you just go up to the bar & grab what looks good (everything), at the end of your meal they count up the toothpicks & you pay 1 euro/pinxto- such a great deal. The drinks are excellent as well- my friends and I tried their sangria and mojito and agreed they were among the best we had on our trip. We went on a late week-night and the place was pretty packed (it's easy to see why) and seemed to be frequented by a lot of local neighborhood people. \u00a0The staff was really friendly, and no worries if you can't speak Catalan/Spanish well- gesturing goes a long way :)",
