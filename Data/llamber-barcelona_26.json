    "The atmosphere is inviting and is what a tapas restaurant should fashion themselves to become. Our plates started in this order, a tour of cured meats, croquettes, parmesan encrusted king prawns with grilled asparagus, Iberian pork shoulder, and beef entrec\u00f4te. It was a gastronomic experience that I am happy to share.",
