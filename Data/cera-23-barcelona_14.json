    "Considering the great reviews on this place I really expected better. \u00a0I only had the volcano black rice, but it was not very good. \u00a0The rice tasted undercooked and the dish was pretty bland. It was strange how bland this dish was as most dishes in Spain lean towards the salty side, which is fine with me as I love salt. \u00a0The seafood on the dish was not the best quality and not all that tastey. \u00a0I've had much better meals in Spain. \u00a0 Maybe if I got some other dish I would have been happier.",
