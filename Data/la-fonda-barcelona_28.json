    "I love this restaurant, the prices are extremely reasonable and the food is excellent. \u00a0Don't visit if you are in a hurry and want a quick meal. \u00a0The lines are long, but you can avoid the rush if you arrive a little before 8 pm. \u00a0Sometimes the line stretches out the door and down the street for a block or more. Delicious food at a great price.",
