    "Art meets food. This little hole in the wall tapas bar has managed to make food that delights the eye while sacrificing none of the flavor. The waiter was delightful, kind, and spoke English. Each bite of art was a pairing of flavors I have never experienced before and delicious! They also have AC inside, which is a welcome reprive from the noon day heat.",
