    "Off the beat and path of the many \u00a0tourist trap Tapas restaurants. \u00a0This place was simply smashing! Very busy, but very accommodating to all. It did not seem to matter if you were a local or tourist. Very extensive tapas menu. They do have an English menu too. Service was a team approach, therefore your food comes to to table quickly but not too fast. I'm sure I could have chosen anything on this menu and would've been totally satisfied. All tapas dishes were very hot and fresh, just the way it should be. The The sangria was very delicious, not too sweet and plenty of fruits added. This restaurant is a sure bet to take friends to that would like to experience good Tapas. You will not be disappointed. You may have to wait, but not really as long as the host states. I guess the greatest thing about Tapas served well is that the tables turn over a lot faster than your typical restaurant. Great and fun experience here. Will definitely love to come back on my next visit.",
