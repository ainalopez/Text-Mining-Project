    "I would like to slap people that give negative reviews to this place. \u00a0chris office amazing food the great prices and it rocks in taste. \u00a0The owner literally works here and it has generationally been in his family for 80+ years. This place was the exact definition of a Spanish terrace dining experience. \u00a0The service level and the attention to detail of the waiters are next to none. One of the things that I noticed is that almost everything on the menu has been manicured to give the people what they demand. Love this place! A must.",
