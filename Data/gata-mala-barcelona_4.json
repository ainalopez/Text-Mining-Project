    "This review is in two parts-1. Gata Mala food and atmosphere- amazing and delicious. We started with vermouth and then switched to wine and with each drink got an additional tapas beyond what we ordered off of the menu. We ordered bombolas (meatballs from heaven), and a mixed tapas plate with tomatoes, eggplant, olives cheese, bread and salade russe. I think we barely spoke to each other without starting the sentence with \"oh yum!\" The inside of the bar is cozy, with a cute chalkboard as the menu and lots of local folks. Firing on all cylinders in my opinion.2. Now for the real reason I am writing this review - the service. Let's talk about our server Pilar - we loved her and it was clear that she cared so much about this place. She knew every single person that walked into the restaurant. She described the food to us in great detail and told us about how much time and care went into each dish. She clearly wanted us to know how much she loved her guests. When we left she hugged my husband and me and told us \"when you are at Gata Mala, you are home.\" We have traveled far and wide, and this was the most caring service we've ever had!!!!!! We love you Pilar!!!",
