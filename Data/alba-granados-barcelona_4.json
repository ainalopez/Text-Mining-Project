    "I don't think I have ever been to a place where I simply did not eat - neither did my mom. \u00a0We were there on Saturday night, and there was one guest we arrived (they left after drinks). \u00a0No other guests arrived - and when we left at 9:30 nobody else was there. \u00a0Anyways, pumpkin ravioli was the main course - had such a weird taste it was inedible. \u00a0I had the warmed asparagus for a starter...it turned out to be white aspargus and cold. \u00a0Clearly wasn't fresh. My mom had the rocket salad which she enjoyed but the baby squid was rubbery and clearly not baby. \u00a0We didn't even eat the bread.",
