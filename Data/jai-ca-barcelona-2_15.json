    "A proper local spot. Jump straight in and stand at the bar because you're lucky to get a table, plus then you get to see all the food on display.The menu lists the food in Spanish, Catalonian and English so once you know what you want try and use the Spanish version as the staff don't speak English and will appreciate you trying to not be another monolingual tourist.The seafood is the specialty, in particular the octopus with potatoes which is very tasty if a little expensive.Three plates of tapas between 2 with a drink \u00a0each was more than enough food and came \u20ac25, great value.",
