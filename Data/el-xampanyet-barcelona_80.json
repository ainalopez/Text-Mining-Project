    "This place is the real deal. Super popular among locals, no tourist traps here. Get there a few minutes before 7 when they reopen for dinner if you want to sit because this place gets packed really fast. This was some of the best food and definitely best authentic tapas we had in Barcelona (see pics). Menu is in Catalan, and we spoke Spanish to the waitress, didn't heat much English, anything we weren't sure of we just pointed to, just say how many servings you want. The wine is cheap and delish. We had anchovies, eat it on top of the bread they give you... It's great. The queso con pimienta we thought would be cheese with peppers inside, but it was cheese stuffed into peppers... Not spicy at all, mostly sweet and salty somehow... Delish. The pan con tomate was legit. The pan con jamon, the patatas.... Amazing. We really enjoyed this and met some friendly people. This place is right across from the Picasso Museum, definitely go!",
