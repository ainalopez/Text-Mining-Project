    "As part of full disclosure I should tell you this review is based upon my visit to Barcelona last year.The first time I tried to find La Plata it was closed. \u00a0But one fascinating thing that jumped out at me, was the beautiful mural on their doors was the only thing on the block that didn't have any graffiti on it. \u00a0I don't mind graffiti but my mind couldn't help but wonder what kind of pull and relationship the owners have in the neighbor hood to have the only unmarked shop. \u00a0There is a fascinating story here waiting to be told!The next time I found it open and it was one of those amazing things. \u00a0Nothing fancy but you they know what they are good at and are quick to recommend some great things to some obvious tourists. \u00a0The sardines, how I still dream of the sardines here. \u00a0The small variety but perfectly cooked with just the right amount of salt. \u00a0And the wine is there really hit the spot the day we stopped. \u00a0Large casks sit near the bar and glasses, or carafes are poured from them and sit in front of you to enjoy the lazy afternoon. \u00a0I think we spent 8 euros here and wanted to go back and try more, but every time we came by they were closed and that lovely mural with a heart and fishes swimming mocked us as we went in search for sardines that were just as good and never found them. \u00a05 stars mainly because of the mystery, the right food at the right time with good wine on a perfect day. \u00a0But I'm sure it is always like that at La Plata.",
