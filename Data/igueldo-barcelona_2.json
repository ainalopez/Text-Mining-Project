    "The kind service here was a gentle introduction to Spain. (Since most of the tourists come for dinner, the manager (?) was nice enough to provide an impromptu translation of the lunch menu for us.)Unfortunately I did not care for the taste of my crunchy rice dish and thought that the portion was relatively small for the price.My wife did enjoy her baby squid in black (squid ink?) sauce.The bread was tasty and the decor was stylishly modern.I'm going to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and say that it's a good place and that I just ordered the wrong dish. But if I ever came back to Barcelona, I'd probably try to find someplace a little more affordable and casual.",
