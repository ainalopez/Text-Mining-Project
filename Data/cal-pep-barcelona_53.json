    "My coworker recommended this place is a must \u00a0try in Barcelona, so here I was.The place is not easy to find, it's located in the small alley and pretty small.We were seated at the bar. Please note that you would be seated next to each other \u00a0with the rest of patrons so if you need some privacy with your dining companion, this is not the place :-).Don't be intimidated by the long line, they go pretty quickly since the service is pretty quick. First batch, second batch, so on.. got \u00a0the idea? No menu to choose for, but the the waiters are friendly and would give you recommendation. We tried the fried squid, the tuna tartar, tortilla tamprera and for dessert creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u00a0At the end of the meal, they asked for email address and gave us postcard. They have been sending us recipe ever since. I have yet to try the recipe though :-)",
