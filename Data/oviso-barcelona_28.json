    "My first review as part of this year's world tour (how's that for a humblebrag).This is a great place for people watching, especially at night when the hipsters take over the playground. Grab a table outside, order a beverage or two and relax for a few hours. This is simple cafe food: foccacia, baguettes, burgers etc. But it is all made with fresh ingredients ald it looks like the cooks care about what they are serving. The burgers are worth a star by themselves.Nothing fancy, but it doesn't pretend to be.",
