    "We came across Sedna while sight seeing Barcelona. \u00a0A waiter saw us looking at the menu and assured us the food was excellent. \u00a0The prices on the menu were reasonable so we thought, \"Why not?\". One of the goals of Barcelona was to get over my dislike for Pialia. \u00a0After an expensive encounter with dried out, over cooked seafood at Cafe Sevilla, I wanted to give it a fair shake. The server steered us to the Pialia Classico. \u00a0We started with the tomato bread. \u00a0Oh so yummy. \u00a0The house salad had some of the best Parmesan cheese. \u00a0The wine we selected was excellent. \u00a0And then came the Pialia. \u00a0Half Lobsters, two large shrimp, muscles, clams and a rice that was closer to risotto. Very good. We wound it up with a chocolate dessert. \u00a0All in all, a great meal. \u00a0Then I get the bill. 195 Euro, $260. \u00a0Really? Turns out the Classico was not on the menu and was 35 Euro a piece. \u00a0The other Pialias were 13 Euro and 15 Euro. I just feel the server should have given me a heads up the the dish I was having was not the dish on the menu.I did get over my dislike for Pialia.",
