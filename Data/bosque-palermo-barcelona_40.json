    "The baby octopus was fresh and very tender, definitely get that. Paella was very good as well, although the seafood in it was overcooked and my partner found it to be too salty. Wine is 2.25 euro a glass I was kind of grossed out by all the flies on the walls and flying around me but tried my best to ignore it. Overall, a great place to get some authentic seafood paella!",
