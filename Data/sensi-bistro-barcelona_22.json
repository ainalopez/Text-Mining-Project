    "Myself and my wife stayed along the ramblas for 3 days with a series of mediocre to good food, a little sad considering Barcelonas reputation. Strayed a good 10 minutes further away than the previous walks for dinner and found this place by luck. \u00a0My wife had the steak, cheaper and better than in most US so called steak restaurants. I had the duck, potato and parmesan dish, named The Best for a reason. Fantastic experience with the local meat and cheese platters as well. Staff was very knowledgeable about their fare and friendly. By chance there was an American, Brit and Spaniard on staff today, not sure their story but the American is from Seattle. Wonderful experience and as expressed to the staff, what we were hoping from a meal in Barcelona.About 50 euro for plates of local meat, local cheese, steak and potato, amazing duck dish, two glasses of red wine, sparkling water and espresso.",
