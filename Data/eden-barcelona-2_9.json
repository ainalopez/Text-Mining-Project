    "We found this gem on Yelp when I was craving pasta, and it's become one of our fave restaurants in Barcelona! For less than 10 euro we got a menu that included a drink (water, beer or wine), a starter, a main course and dessert. For my starter I chose a delicious bowl of penne with a tomato cream sauce, but other options included a mixed salad with tuna or pasta pomodoro. The main dish options were pizza Margherita or a pizza with really good chorizo, onions and olives, or for a euro more a steak with potatoes. We ordered all three but I think the chorizo pizza was the best. The desserts were ok (cheesecake, ice cream or vanilla pudding), but by the end we were so full we didn't care. Will definitely be back!",
