    "We were looking for a tapas place in the Gothic area which had been recommended by a friend but was disappointed to find it was closed for vacation. Fortunately, Tapeo was nearby so we decided to give it a try. It was a nice find as the food was delicious and reasonably priced. We had the bombeta de la barceloneta, cod fritters, stewed and glazed beef cheek, black fideua with cuttlefish and creamy chocolate with bread, oil and salt. My favorites were the black fideua and the bombeta.",
