    "I ordered the house wine, the seafood platter and the paella for two. Everything was good. I highly recommend the wine - it is an extremely good deal. The seafood platter was bountiful and delicious. Definitely a highlight. The paella was large and included even more seafood. It was rich with flavour and easy to indulge in. Overall the experience was really good and the food delivered as hoped for.",
