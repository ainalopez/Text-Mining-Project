    "We had some very high expectations since this was \u00a0the award-winning chef Marc Gascon's new venue, but was met and exceeded. There was a little bit of snafu about reservations as we walked by the place to book a table for the next day and somehow the server I gave my name and number didn't enter it in the guestbook. Anyway, our party of 3 was accommodated with a table for 2 - no matter, there was enough room.One funny thing was our server immediately brought out a bottle of Cava and asked us if we'd like some, and since in a couple of other places it was complimentary I said yes, he brought out a cold bucket and served it. That was okay, too, as I really wanted it anyway.On to the food - we had the patatas bravas(okay) and \u00a0tomato salad with anchovies and tuna belly(excellent), Salmon Tartar (very good). My daughter had the Clams from Carril (excellent), wife had the grilled Prawns, which came in it's own little grill (excellent) and I had Roasted Monkfish(very good). There was also a special Mushroom dish which we ordered (good).For dessert they had something called Bombay Sapphire gin and tonic - made to look like whipped cream, it packs a punch. Daughter had the Fresh Cheese Flan.Washed down with Cava, it was a perfect meal at a reasonable price.",
