    "While it may not be among the best Barcelona's has to offer, El Cercle remains a wonderful rooftop locale to enjoy a beverage, a bite to eat, and \u00a0drink in the wonderful ambience of Barcelona's Gothic quarter. This is a place that will surely delight if you're not too picky. The service is typically European, meaning a bit slow and occasionally slipshot, but they will ultimately deliver if you're patient. The food is good if you stick with the local classics. There's a full bar menu and a handful of beers. I recommend the drafts.My advice is to go for the ambience, and for a bit of relaxation. Check your American expectations at the door and embrace the fact you're in one of the best neighborhoods of one of world's most wonderful cities.",
