    "We had the pleasure of snacking here in the off season in November 2014. It is small tapas bar (there were 5 tables and standing room inside/outside) that also has a wine/product store in the back. As soon as we walked in, we knew that this was a \"locals only\" type of spot. \u00a0We gave this spot 5 stars because it was a truly authentic Barcelona tapas experience.It was 8:30 p.m. and there was only one other group drinking/smoking outside. The proprietor/staff were extremely friendly and made us feel welcome. We made an effort to speak our best broken Spanish and ask questions about themselves, the restaurant and Barcelona. They spoke a bit of English. We also expressed to them that we were not in a rush and would eat/drink whatever they brought to us. We were initially hesitant about the big plate of fried Sardines that we were brought but they were great. It was a cool experience to have locals walk in, look at us and say \"I want what she is having.\" We were also served fresh sundried or stewed tomatoes on bread with anchovies which was completely delicious. The wine that was recommended was very good. Also, they brought us a brandy/juice dessert drink to go with our chocolate cake which was amazing. The place was soon packed with locals and we had little interaction with the staff until closing time. They were so busy. We just sat back and enjoyed the experience. We also bought a bottle of wine and some bottled tomatoes. Overall, the price was very reasonable. We would also recommend bringing a large empty plastic bottle if you want to buy some great, cheap wine from the barrels in the back.",
