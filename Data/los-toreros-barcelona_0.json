    "Funky little joint with friendly staff and good food. We had a mixed salad, the bacalao croquettes and the seafood paella for two with a bottle of very nice dry white wine. \u00a0Food was delicious and very reasonable. We couldn't finish it all. For me, the paella could have been a little more dry and crisp on the bottom but that's just me. It was a good mix of locals and tourists and we sat for a couple of hours listening to the various languages and watching people discover the food and enjoy their meals. We didn't try the sangria but most people did, including a couple of young spaniards who ordered a pitcher of it along with the seafood paella.",
