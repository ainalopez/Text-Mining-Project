    "The best tapas in Barcelona? Who knows, I could eat for years here and still probably not find the best tapas. However you certainly wouldn't be disappointed at La Flauta.Dining solo I sat at the bar avoiding the line for the main dining room and had a few small plates. If you are solo or want to try a lot get the 1/2 size portions of the bocadillos and tapas. Two or three will still fill you up. The highlight for me was the foie gras lobe with fruit on toast. Perfect bite of food. The quality of the food is very high, the prices reasonable for such a popular place. They have menus in English and Spanish.",
