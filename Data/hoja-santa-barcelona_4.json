    "My boyfriend and I went to Hoja Santa during a short stop over at the end of our trip to Spain this July. \u00a0We loved it and if you like Mexican food, \u00a0I highly recommend it. \u00a0We to came to Barcelona from the Basque Country and Rioja where we went to a couple Michelin starred restaurants and had one of the best dining experiences of our lives at one of them. So, we were both overstuffed and coming in with a raised bar in terms of excellent dining experiences. We went on a Thursday evening and the concierge at our hotel made the reservation that same day. We had eaten at Pakta on a previous trip to Barcelona and loved it, so we thought we'd try the new restaurant by the same owners. Because the place is new and there were not many reviews, we didn't have any expectations. So, we were very pleasantly surprised. \u00a0We did the tasting menu, which I would recommend. It was not crazy expensive for what you get and was very creative and delicious. The cocktails, most of which are tequila or mezcal based, were beautiful and delicious. My boyfriend, who is a cocktail connoisseur and not easily impressed, was in heaven. Highlights included the mezcal margarita and a horchata cocktail with mezcal that I had with desert. There was also an avocado gazpacho that was served in a shelled out avocado that was delicious. I would definitively recommend this place and would love to go back soon!",
