    "This breakfast place was a great find since the Spanish don't really do big breakfast.I had the fruit and granola which was really nice after eating sooo heavy for my other meals. The staff is super friendly and we ended up going there 2 days in a row just for the fruit and granola dish. My friend had the benedict and she said it was also great! If you are in the area then i highly recommend it but around 10:30AM it gets a bit more busy.",
