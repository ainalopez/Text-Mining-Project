    "We were traveling thru Spain for two weeks, and the lunch we ate here was by far the WORST meal of our entire trip. Maybe it's bc we got the prix fixe but honestly, we couldn't even eat the sorry excuse for 'paella' and some gross, sour cold soup and withered greens with the fishiest raw 'cod' I've ever tasted. We didn't even get the dessert, just got the check and bounced. Giving two stars for the service only - the waiters were all attentive and on point; Not their fault the food is atrocious. Nice spot to people watch and order a drink or two but DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!",
