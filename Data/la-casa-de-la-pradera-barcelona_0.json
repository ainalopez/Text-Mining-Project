    "I *LOVE* Casa de la Pradera. \u00a0A small whole in the wall, La Pradera is one of those places that you wish you would have known about forever...! \u00a0In fact, though, this sweet spot isn't that old. \u00a0Nevertheless, the decor is vintage, interesting, and overall, cool! \u00a0Indeed, I say cool because this bar draw draws all the cool hip young kids from big bad BCN. \u00a0They come for the great drinks but, I think, most of all because of the fabulous music. \u00a0A live DJ is there (at least on the weekend nights I've been), pumping out some pretty darned good alternative/electro music. \u00a0Really, I don't have a lot of negative things to say about this place. \u00a0It's absolutely *fabulous*! \u00a0A must-visit if you're in lower Raval with some time on your hands and an itch to have fun :)",
