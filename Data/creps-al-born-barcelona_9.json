    "This place is pretty cool. My bf and I went at night, and were initially turned off by the crowdedness. BUT, the bartenders are great! The food is great! And the crepes are great! The crowd was a bit much, but once you get your AWESOME drinks, you will have no cares! You must try the drinks in the bag!! What an amazing idea. I love the drink bags, especially the Solero. The drink they light on fire is pretty cool too. The bartenders are very attentive and entertaining--definitely a plus! I highly recommend this place for a late night drink and crepe.",
