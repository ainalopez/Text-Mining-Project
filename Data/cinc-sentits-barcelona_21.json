    "4.5 stars!Came here for a long lunch, Sept 2011. \u00a0They take reservations on their website only 2 weeks prior to when you want to show up, but if you book right at the 2 week mark, I think there's no problem getting in.I write this review in sort of a comparison to Alkimia which across other food boards, appears to be the two comparison, which I feel is strange because they are such very different places!! \u00a0i prefer the food preparation at Alkimia because I prefer that Alkimia is more experimental. \u00a0but cinc sentits was more traditional but had wonderful highlights.The cuisine is modern take on barcelona cuisine. \u00a0One mention, the service here is amazing! \u00a0Worthy of a fine dining experience. \u00a0They all spoke great english which was a great plus for us and every dish was explained with a true intention, as if the staff was passionate about the dish.Overall I felt it was probably less modern and more traditional, although there were several dishes that were really playful. Favorite: \u00a0caramelized large piece of foie gras. probably one of my all time favorite preparations of foie!! so delicious -- please splurge for this extra supplement.overall, a great experience and great place to dine in barcelona. \u00a0go for the lunch!",
