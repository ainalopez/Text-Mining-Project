    "We were probably the worst part of this experience. None of us spoke a lick of Spanish and the waiter didn't speak English, though I could hardly blame him considering we were in Spain. \u00a0Despite the language barrier, the dining experience was undeniably delicious! \u00a0I speak broken Spanish, you know, a word here, a word there. \u00a0I'm good for almost getting the gist of the sentence with a bit of imagination. Our waiter was apologetic to us for not speaking English (how thoughtful of him). \u00a0I know he said something about especial- Catalina tomatoes after we grunted and pointed to items on the menu like cave people. We just said yeah because we thought it might be good and he was right, they were special! These tomatoes were unlike any other I've ever had. I don't know why they were so good, but we ate them like scavengers and eyed the amounts the others consumed to make sure we got our fair share. So, some of us needed to utilize the word media to describe the steak because someone commented that they thought theirs was still mooing. \u00a0Despite the moo, every plate was wiped clean. Even my fish which was perfectly prepared. Best of all, the house wine was phenomenal. I would definitely say that NoNoNo is a must on any trip to Barcleona.",
