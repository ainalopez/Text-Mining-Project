    "We are tourist from the US and decided to have dinner at the 5j since the restaurant was beautiful and the food looked great. We quickly learned that the service is not intended for tourist (Americans) since the servers were somewhat rude and were not as attentive as expected. Reading all other reviews we now somewhat understand the culture. The food was tasty just a little expensive for the portions.",
