    "LOOOOOOVE this place!!! We missed our lunch tiem attempt \u00a0and wow was I glad it didn't work out! We went back for dinner and stood in line for 30mins for it open. It was well worth the wait!! When we walked in they asked how many in our party? We told them 5 and they brought us to the back!!! The front is diner style seating only for 12people...but in the back there is a room where they store their wine...It's only for reservations and a group of 4 or more! Our waiter was AWESOME! Loved him - he was so nice! All of the food was so fresh and tasty!!!!*If you know you are going there ahead of time, call and reserve a table in the back for a party of 4 or more! The waiter told us a WEEK in advance is about right*It was our best meal of the trip!!!!!!!!",
