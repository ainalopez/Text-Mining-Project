    "We absolutely loved La Pepita! Although it is very busy, it is worth the wait and once you get seated they serve you pretty quick. As a party of 2, we shared a few tapas (3) and then each got a pepita. It was just the right amount of food. Definitely recommend the aubergine fritters and the potatoes bravas - delicious!",
