    "Our Michelin experience in Barcelona. Holds two well-justified stars. The interior reminds me of Marea in NYC. Make sure your attire is elegant or you may feel out of place. The service was superb, not too stuffy. We had the tasting menu, although they let my daughter order a la carte which is unusual in a restaurant such as this. The highlights of the tasting menu was the lightly smoked oyster which is the best oyster dish I've ever had. The red prawn was memorable, as was the low-temperature cooked turbot. I also still think about the roast pigeon as well. The desserts were very good, not quite the level of the savory dishes but very good nonetheless. Worth the 135 euros. If money is no object I'd say Lasarte is the best in Barcelona, although Tickets is more fun, if that makes any sense. Very different styles, but both are excellent.When we go back to Barcelona will probably try their lunch menu which are all Martin Berasategui dishes (my son really wanted to try them) as well as going back for dinner.",
