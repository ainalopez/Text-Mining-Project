    "Barcelona nightlife is honestly some of the greatest in the world. I found this place getting lost in the back streets of Barcelona and had a blast. \u00a0As Melissa mentions they have their own beer Krut which got us hammered on accident. Could have also been the ten we had before and sangria at one of the fountains everyone hangs out at.You can literally find any kind of bar, nightlife, or lounge by just walking down the obvious alleys behind Las Ramblas. People in Spain are super accepting of different cultures, values, looks, styles and everything else.",
