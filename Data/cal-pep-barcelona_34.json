    "Phenomenal experience. Wonderful food, atmosphere, service- it has it all. If you can get in without a long wait... Get there early and you will not be disappointed. Ask your server to just bring what they recommend and be surprised. Mouthwatering seafood and just a really fun experience. Not overly pricey. They are very efficient with serving so just order one thing at a time if you want to drag it out more and savor the moment.",
