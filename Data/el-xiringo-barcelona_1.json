    "Chef Xavi is an expert with two very important things seafood and cava. You simply cannot go wrong by putting a night out in his hands.We had after dinner drinks and dessert at el xiringo during our first night in Barcelona tasting the best cava we've ever had and could not resist coming back the next night. The following evening our meal began with perfectly grilled octopus, gently seared tuna, and the most delicious shrimp, but the show stopper was the seafood and rice. Everything was cooked perfectly with each ingredient standing on its own and at the same time blending perfectly. Xavi also has a great wine list and makes the best gin and tonic I've ever had. \u00a0For dessert order the crema catalana with pineapple.",
