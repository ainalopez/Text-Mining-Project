    "We were at La Boqueria on La Rambla and starving so skipped the wait at the highly recommended El Quim (yelp.com/biz/el-quim-de-\u2026) and found Bar Clemens in the back left corner of the market, if you're entering from La Rambla.Tasty and cheap breakfast items and pretty decent coffee (yelp.com/biz_photos/_cuP\u2026). You can see my pictures of the menu as well as skewers ready to grill in their cold case.In the Boqueria website they list their specialties as \u00a0 \u00a0- Desayunos (breakfast) \u00a0 \u00a0- Bocadillos frios y calientes (hot & cold sandwiches) \u00a0 \u00a0- Aperitivos (snacks) \u00a0 \u00a0- Tapas",
