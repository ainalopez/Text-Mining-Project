    "Cal Pep was highly recommended to me before going to Barcelona, so my expectations were high. First off, this is a popular place and not only is it popular, it is very small. If you are not on time (before they open) you will most likely be queuing outside. I think we waited about 45 minutes to get a seat at the bar (you sit and eat at what looks like a bar).Once you manage to get your orders in, or rather tell the chef what you like, you are served quite fast while watching the waiters and chefs run on and off shouting behind the counter. The quality of the food is good, but for me it wasn't mind blowing good. It is a hectic and noisy atmosphere here, which does make it a bit hard for me to enjoy. The queue goes behind your back, you have people half a meter behind you while you eat, noise levels are high and you are quickly disposed of when finished. For me, I really dislike queuing and noisy restaurants, so as you can see that brings the overall down.As a side note, they ask for your email after you are done, so now I have been getting recipes in my email. Nice touch!",
