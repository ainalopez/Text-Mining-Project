    "Awesome place. Really good and varied tapas, fantastic services and good prices. The seafood tapas was very fresh. Through out the night they kept bringing new tapas dishes out all night. The crowd fluctuates. It will be very crowded and busy for a while then clear out and get crowded again. \u00a0Overall awesome time.",
