    "Just as everyone said. This place was great both in delicious tapas and atmosphere. We stood at the bar as it was crowded but being our first time at a tapas bar it worked out well. As a previous reviewer indicated, \"If something is coming out of the kitchen and they offer it to you, take it.\" Our server asked if we like meat or fish, we said meat. Within 10-15 minutes we had a plate of pork and peppers and sausage and garbanzos. Both terrific.",
