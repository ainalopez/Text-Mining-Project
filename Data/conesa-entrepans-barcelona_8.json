    "A small little sandwich place that me and my sister found in Barcelona. The line was fairly short and food came fast. The sandwich-maker and cashier were both super friendly. There are so many different sandwiches to choose from (lots of healthy options) and most of them are very cheap. One sandwich is pretty filling.",
