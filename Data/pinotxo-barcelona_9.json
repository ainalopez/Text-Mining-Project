    "Do you know what a cronut is? So do the folks of Spain, because they did it first!!! And it's called a xiuxo (chu'-choe) and sells out within the hour of delivery to Pinotxo. As others have noted, the food that is actually made here isn't the best - our spinach and pine nut omelette was extremely salty and the tomato bread was forgettable. The coffee was also rather weak. That being said, the experience of eating here as well as the xiuxo made it well worth it! \u00a0This particular stall opens up before many of the others and serves tourists, locals, beggars, and market workers alike. We arrived at seven in the morning and scored seats. Juanito was so nice, cheerful, and helpful. As we were eating, a delivery of baked goodies (the xiuxo) arrive as did throngs of people to grab them and toss some coins down. Juanito began stacking them up against the glass in the stall (while they were still letting off steam!) and explained to us what they were. Holy smokes, fried croissant-like pastries filled with custard and lightly dusted with granulated sugar. Made fresh. Heaven. My husband dislikes sweets but ordered another after we devoured our first!It was such an experience to enjoy a leisurely casual breakfast sitting here chatting with Juanito as La Boqueria slowly awoke. An absolute must for the AM just for the xiuxo!",
