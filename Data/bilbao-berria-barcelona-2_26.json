    "It's more of a pintxos (peen-chose) bar rather than a traditional Spanish tapas bar. \u00a0From my understanding, however, Basque cuisine has become quite the trend in Barcelona.The way it's set up is similar to a buffet. \u00a0Pick up a plate and start putting items on your plate which interest you. \u00a0The only difference however is that every item is impaled by a large toothpick. \u00a0These sticks are to be placed in the cylindrical metal receptacle in the center of your table to later be tabulated by your server. \u00a0Each stick is around 1\u20ac60, so it's also kind of like dim sum wherein your bill can add up very quickly from all the items you pick up.I feel they put some of the less desirable items near the front of the line and the better ones at the end of the line, so my suggestion would be to take a quick walk-through before putting anything on your plate.",
