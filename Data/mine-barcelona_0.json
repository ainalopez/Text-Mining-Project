    "We'd have walked right past this little jewel if my husband hadn't done his Yelp homework. The fixed-price menu offers three choices from each category: appetizer, entree and dessert. The gazpacho is the best I've had, and the goat cheese salad was outstanding. Eggs, a Catalunya specialty, are something special here. We chose cannelloni for our entrees and ganache for dessert. Not only was the food superb, but the service was friendly and responsive. We had a rambunctious toddler with us who was charmed by our waitress. (She learned her excellent English by watching American movies and TV.) A charming place--definitely recommend.",
