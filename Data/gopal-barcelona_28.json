    "Gopal is one of the most delicious places ever! When traveling, it's so hard to find vegan options. Especially in the very meaty Spain. Gopal is heaven! Best veggie burgers ever. And the patatas bravas are so very tasty! We made it a point to come back through Barcelona on our second trip to Spain just so we could come back to gopal. No joke. Wish they had this place in the United States. Also, the staff is always super sweet and patient with my bad Spanish.",
