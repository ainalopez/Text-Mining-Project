    "I was in Barcelona from June 2-4 and went here largely based on the Yelp reviews, was not disappointed... ended up coming again the next day for lunch! It's cheap -- we could hardly believe it when the drink and dessert were included in the price and the staff was beyond friendly, patiently describing in detail all of their dishes to the point that I actually started to feel like they needed to stop because they were doting on us too much! We loved the food too, the empanadas were simple and rustic and the pasta was very good, I especially loved the Tucco sauce! The owner seems to address each table individually and engage them in conversation which was nice. To top it off, we left when it was a bit busy and, as we walked away down the alley, the owner actually ran out of the restaurant to wave and say goodbye to us! How many places can you say something like that would happen?! Great people and great food in a very chill and welcoming atmosphere at a cheap price. What more can you ask for?",
