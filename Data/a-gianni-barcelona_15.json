    "After living in Barcelona for 3 months over the summer, this is by far my favorite restaurant! The food, wine, and service are amazing and it has a lovely atmosphere. I recommend the gnocchi!! Best I've ever had. The caprese salad is also wonderful! Absolutely love this place, I went several times during my time in Spain :)",
