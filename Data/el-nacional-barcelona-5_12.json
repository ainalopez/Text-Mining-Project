    "We dined at La Paradeta last night ( May 5th, 2016). The food was ok-ish. However the service was perhaps the worst I have ever encountered in the entire city of Barcelona. Slow, wrong orders and waiter (Marcos) extremely uninterested, rude and obnoxious. Am absolute disappointment! If I ever go back to El Nacional I will make sure I don't ever step foot again at \"La Paradeta\". I work in the travel industry and will e sure this place is not recommended to any of our clients.",
