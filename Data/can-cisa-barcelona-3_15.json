    "Had an amazing experience here. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The tapas were divine - we had the cured beef, porchetta and eggplant. The cured beef just melts in your mouth. The porchetta was served with fig jam and 2 slices of bread underneath, soaking up the sweet and salty juices from the porchetta and the fig jam. The eggplant was paired with a mint pur\u00e9e, which made it very refreshing. The olive bread was delicious as well.This place is tucked away in a small alley near Picasso museum.",
