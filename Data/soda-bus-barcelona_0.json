    "A friend took me to Soda Bus tonight and I totally loved it. First of all, the girl who took our order was super friendly and helpful, giving advice on everything she could. We had two different flavors of Daikiri (strawberry and mango, both very nice but I prefer strawberry) and a Super Melon, which is made with vodka and natural melon. The size of the cocktails was more than okay and all of them had pieces of natural fruit inside (no syrups!). The decoration inside the bar is inspired in an English bus which make it look very cool. There is a real size bus inside the bar, no jokes. About the prices, the cocktails cost an average of 8-10\u20ac (if you have a super cocktail, which consists in a double-sized version of the normal ones, it will be 12\u20ac) which is a little higher than in other bars, but who cares paying a little more if the waiters are extremely kind and make you have a smile on your face during your stay (the treatment is not everything, but let's be clear, it is an important thing). They also serve food, like burgers and other \"fast-food\" stuff, but we did not eat anything so I will have to come back to finish my opinion. By now, I can only speak well about them.",
