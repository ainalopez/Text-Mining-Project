    "An unassuming, yet wonderful restaurant on Carrer d'Arag\u00f3. The narrow room offers many tables for 2 or 4 guests, larger tables in the back. The menu offers a wide selection of starters and main dishes at very reasonable prices. I had the rucola salad and filet strips on couscous and curry sauce, others in the group had fish, steak and duck. Service was fast and attentive. Good value at around 20EUR/guest, and easily reached from Placa Catalunya or Passeig de Gracia. A definite recommedation.",
