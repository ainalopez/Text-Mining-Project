    "More than a snack, but not a full lunch. One sandwich will hold you over for a few hours, but you may need to buy patatas bravas or other sides to really fill you up. Great fresh ingredients that are prepared right before you in under 5 minutes. Unlimited sauces at your discretion is a good perk. They accept credit cards with no minimum- a big perk of going La Conesa",
