    "Amazing place. Been there twice now and want to go back.The first time we visited, the owner came and sat at the table to take our orders. The second time was a quieter night, so the chef came out, sat down and walked us through the menu. It was really amazing to get the fine details of the menu.Both times, we opted for the sashimi (its on the specials list), which I highly recommend. We also had the soft-shell crab, which was also really amazing and were told by the chef, it is one of the favorites. The apple pie at the end was also a big highlight. Overall, an amazing place and definitely worthwhile.",
