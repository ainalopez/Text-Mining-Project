    "I'll admit it, I was lured in by the \"free tapas\" promotion. I regret falling for this.The food was undercooked and fast foody (at best), the service was rude (they laughed at our poor Spanish) and the free tapa was an overcooked meatball on a plastic plate (it was gross).This was not a pleasant experience at all.",
