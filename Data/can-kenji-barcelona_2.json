    "This sushi was awesome. \u00a0Came here without a reservation but luckily we were able to squeeze by the sushi bar on the restaurant's little stools. \u00a0The sushi was incredibly fresh, flavorful and masterfully crafted.We ordered a few appetizers to share and they were fine for sharing - we ordered 4 to split among the 7 of us which seemed to work pretty well. \u00a0The duck spring rolls were really good - crunchy, some vegetables inside and the duck was well prepared. \u00a0We also got the duck and scallions cooked in miso which was small morsels of duck in a light miso broth.For sushi I ordered the sushi assortment which was about 15 euros and had a tuna roll, various futomaki and other rolls and 6 pieces of really, really good sushi. \u00a0Under the tuna there was tucked a shiso leaf which really brought out the flavors of the fish, the salmon was perfectly seasoned, etc., and the amount of food was worth the price. \u00a0Next time I will probably just get more sushi as it was so tasty. The service was efficient and friendly. \u00a0They were pretty diligent about getting us more cava and water and happy to help us split the bill.",
