    "Out favorite meal in a week of gastronomic excess. \u00a0Javier, the host/owner/waiter was just a hoot. \u00a0Very engaging. \u00a0Literally sits at your table to discuss the menu and whatever else comes to mind. \u00a0Food was truly amazing and a wonderful change from the plethora of tapas spots. \u00a0Everything we ate, we loved. \u00a0Started with specialty cocktails (tamarind margarita, grape martini) and chips with delicious spinach/artichoke dip. \u00a0Lamb carpaccio, mackerel sashimi, green papaya salad (outrageous), scallop dish (with \"things\" on top per Javier) were all great. \u00a0Standout was the pork dish with mushrooms that was as good a single dish as I have ever tasted. \u00a0Goat cheese cheesecake for dessert. \u00a0Wow!",
