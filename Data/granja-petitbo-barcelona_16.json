    "The juices are great and the food is very good. The only complaint I had is that they seem understaffed and the waiters/waitresses aren't always very kind. I go there every other day around 12-2:30pm (when it's the busiest) and it's sometimes very difficult to get a table. I've been passed up a couple of times for a native person who came in after I did. But otherwise, it is a cool caf\u00e9 with an even cooler atmosphere.",
