    "Milk was quite a walk from our hotel but I had seen the Yelp love it was getting and decided I could not miss out. They are open all day and do a variety of meals and drinks but seem to specialise in breakfast so that's what we went for. The breakfasts here are brilliant and huge! No cutting the corners here the chef fills your plate till there is no room left. I had my first ever eggs Benedict (yes I ain't tried it before) and it was awesome. Trudie M (da wife) had the veggie omelette and I sneaked a bit of that to. It was also very very nice.Milk was great. It's the sort of place where you sit down and look to the table next to you and go bloody hell what are they eating. I will have that. I can only hope \u00a0the German folk who sat beside us enjoyed the eggs Benedict and veggie omelettes they ordered after seeing ours!",
