    "We ate at La Llotja, the fish market in restaurant. We started with a 1/2 dozen oysters - they were fine, but I like my oysters a little smaller and less briny. Our main course we had the sea-bream for two. The presentation and service of the fish was spectacular. The fish was baked and delivered encrusted in sea salt. The server filleted the fish like a surgeon removing 99.8% of the bones. The sea-bream was absolutely delicious. I would have preferred more veggies on the side, but not a big deal. I know I should be drinking wine while in Spain, but I am a sucker for a large beer served in a mason jar. I will definitely return to try one of the other restaurants/bars.",
