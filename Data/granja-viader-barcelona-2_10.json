    "Truly THE BEST chocolate con churros! Yummy, thick, dark chocolate and crispy warm churros with a sprinkle of sugar. We also had their cheesecake that had a light, spongy yet moist texture which seemed to me was more like an egg pie. Slightly sweet with a refreshing hint of lemon flavor. The cream on the hot chocolate was so fresh and was a nice accompaniment to the drink!",
