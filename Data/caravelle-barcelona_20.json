    "My friend Jez told me about this spot because he knows the owner. These UK boys are doing it right here in Barcelona with their in-house curing, bottling, smoking and pickling, add to the mix some tasty brunch/lunch options (Bistec on Brioche & Huevos Rancheros that are off the hook) and wash it down with their chilled Raspberry tea and you are in for a treat! Menu and lace is small but done well, free wifi and good mix of local and \"in the know\" travelers. Two more days left in Barcelona so I will make use of my time wisely and come back again! Provecho!",
