    "Had dinner here during our first night in Barcelona after we stumbled upon it strolling through L'Eixample. \u00a0My wife had a huge bowl of cream of artichoke soup and I had a tomato, Spanish onion and tuna belly salad to start. \u00a0My salad was full of flavor and I had to fight her off with my utensils to keep her from stealing it all. \u00a0For the main course I had pork in red curry and coconut milk. \u00a0The pork was a bit dry but there was so much flavor from the curry and coconut milk that I almost didn't notice. \u00a0She had chicken brochettes over rice which was also very flavorful. \u00a0We had a great bottle of red that was a blend and at13\u20ac was the highest priced red on the menu. \u00a0The meal was only 48\u20ac. \u00a0If I lived in Barcelona, I'd be a regular.",
