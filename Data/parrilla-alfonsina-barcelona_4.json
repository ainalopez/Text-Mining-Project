    "Loved this place! Honestly we went here as a second choice to the Irish bar up the road which was too busy due to the football. So glad we made the 10 minute walk.We were welcomed and seated straight away near the kitchen at the back. The decor is a little tired but the atmosphere is friendly. The staff were lovely and gave us bread and chimichurri while we decided.I ordered the 280g Tenderloin (obvs) and the wife had the \"boneless chicken breast).Drinks and food arrived promptly and it was all hot and super tasty. The steak was some of the best I've had, cooked to almost to my liking (although I usually order medium expecting medium rare so that was a win). Unfortunately the wife's chicken can out as pretty much a half chicken, bones and all. We found no cause for complaint though as it was delicious. I thoroughly recommend you visit Parrilla Alfonsina. For less than 50\u20ac we had bread, 2 mains and 3 drinks. Can't complain at that!!",
