    "Awesome food!! There is pretty less to tell.. We tried a lot: zucchini carpaccio with goat-cheese was very very good, the creamy mozzarella was really good, the Iberian rips and the Iberian shoulder were awesome! Especially the shoulder was perfect.. The desserts (lemon cake with mereng, tiramisu decorated in a small pot, cheese cake) were exactly holy as the main courses! Very big compliments",
