    "We stopped into Bardot one morning for an alfresco breakfast. \u00a0The waitress was very friendly. \u00a0It's located in a prime location on Granados, smack-dab in the upscale Eixample District. \u00a0Our simple and straightforward breakfast (eggs, bacon, bread) was all tasty and well-presented. \u00a0The only thing that hinders me from giving Bardot 4-stars is simply that the wait-time to get our breakfast was exorbitantly lengthy -- I mean, we were starving by the time the food arrived...! \u00a0Again, though, really friendly waitress....",
