    "This is my number 1 place in BCN for tasty gourmet burgers. It's owned by the same people of El Kiosko; what I love about this location is that's a great hole in the wall!Don't get me wrong...the eating is just as messyband delicous as many other burgers places. What really makes a difference is the type of burgers you'll encounter here. Fresh high quality ingredients and of course not so common. Lamb, brie, foie, oax, etc..Impressed with the Japanese burger i must say that sauce is deliiiiiiicious! Great hole in the wall.Definetly a must try.",
