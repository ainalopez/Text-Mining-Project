    "I was looking for a delicious and healthy place to take my husband on our recent trip to Barcelona. He's a guy who could live off of pizza and chicken strips, but he promised to do whatever I wanted on this trip since he gets to go to El Clasico. \u00a0I ordered the small goat cheese salad and lasagna. He ordered the Seiten Burger (go figure). The flavors in my salad were balanced and interesting, and it was so filling, I boxed my lasagna to go (which was slightly on the salty side, but very good later). He ate his whole meal and said he'd do it again (progress!). I was really excited about their juicery because I just came off a juice cleanse and didn't want to eat out constantly. \u00a0I bought 8 cold pressed juices to go. So far, the Coco Masalachai is super tasty. Prices were equivalent to what I'm used to in Houston, TX, \u00a0USA.",
