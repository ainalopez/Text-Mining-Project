    "This place was packed, but everyone working there was working hard!The food was great. \u00a0I was skeptical of vegan beer bar food, but it was GOOD. \u00a0I had the beet burger, it was perfect.But more important than the food and the awesome comics they made into wall paper (and coincidentally blessed by the artist); is the awesome beer selection. \u00a0The prices are reasonable, and the pours are perfect.Some of the beers you can even take to go, (which we did, drank, and refilled before leaving Barcelona). \u00a0That's right, we visited two times as many days.",
