    "Oh... My.... Goodness! This is my first time to brunch and cake. And it is worthy enough to want to come back to Barcelona just for the food! From the the communal tables to the outdoor seating; it was all so impressive. I have traveled all over the world, and this by far was the best brunch I've ever had!",
