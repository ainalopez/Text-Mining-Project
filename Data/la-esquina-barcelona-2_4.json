    "Located right next to the Starbucks. This awesome restaurant is easily accessible via Metro or walking if you're anywhere near Placa Catalunya. The food is amazing - we had the bikini (must have!), chicken sandwich, meatball sandwich, and grilled veggies. Absolutely delightful. My mom had coffee and said it was incredible - definitely a must have if you go here.The owner is originally from England and is so kind and humble. We actually came here two days in a row because of the wonderful service and food - our servers, Lea and Merl, were \u00a0lovely both days!We had to leave for Madrid the next day, but I'm still dreaming of the bikini sandwich I ate. Best ham and cheese I've ever had!",
