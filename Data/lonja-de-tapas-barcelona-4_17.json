    "This was a total letdown. It looked so nice and cozy from the outside, but once inside we quickly suspected we'd fallen into a tourist trap. The staff was in attentive and uninspired. This was a quiet night, the restaurant was not even half full, and yet we were forgotten twice. One of our orders came 20-30 minutes after we'd finished eating. We were asked if we wanted to see the desert menu, answered 'yes', and it just never showed up. The food was okay, nothing spectacular. Overall the whole experience was let down by feeling like you were a nuisance to the staff just by showing up.Not going back here!",
