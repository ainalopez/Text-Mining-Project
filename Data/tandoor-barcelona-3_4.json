    "Very good food. One of the very few nice indian places in Barcelona. I went with friends and everyone liked the food. Seems they use real Tandoor to make rotis and nans, so taste very authentic. We had full 3 course meal and believe me all of them was very good. Price is on a higher side but never mind as we all liked the food. Staff is very warm and welcoming. Good service as well.",
