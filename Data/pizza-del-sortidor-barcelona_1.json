Pizzas arrive in boxes so no washing up. Beers in plastic cups (2euro). Service was quick on a Sunday lunch & let you take a doggy bag home - not that we needed it!Finished off the meal with a complimentary shot of limoncello straight from the freezer!Ooh top tip - pizzas are 7 euro on a tues & weds.",
