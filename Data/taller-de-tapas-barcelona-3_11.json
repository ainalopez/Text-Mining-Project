    "Rushed, impersonal service. English menu available. When we asked our waiter for recommendations, he sounded irritated and said look at the chef's specials on the menu. Had to flag our waiter several times. We had the anchovy tapas (\u20ac4.80), chorizo (\u20ac4.05), grilled shrimp (\u20ac3.55), burger (\u20ac7.85), tomato bread (forgot price). Drank water and red wine. Meh food & service.ps - 15% price increase if you eat outside (we ate inside)",
