    "My friend and I dropped by for lunch. The hours say they open at 12pm however, when we went, the chairs were still stacked on the tables and they told us to come back in 30 minutes. We came back and here's what I have to say!The food: Delicious! It's a treat in itself to see everything on display and be able to ponder a little and walk down the counter before picking up a few or several pinchos. All pinchos are 1 euro, except the ones with red buttons, which cost 1.8 euros. Cerveza was 1.8 euro a copa.The ambiance: Super chill. There are high and regular tables and seats at the counter. Everything is laid back. And I loved the music. They were bumping classic and recent hip hop in the afternoon lol.The service: They are really good about informing everyone that comes in about how it all works. I think I saw the bartenders talk to everyone explaining about the toothpicks and whatnot. I asked the server for recommendations and she gave me several, which I appreciated.",
