    "This place is amazing! After I discovered it, I went every day for breakfast. It can get packed but I did not have to wait longer than 5 minutes and even then the staff apologized for my wait (like seriously?). The food is delicious, I highly recommend the coconut bread with the pear...one of the best things I ate in my life! But everything there is great, especially their fresh squeezed orange juice. The service is on par with the food. The waiters are all super enthusiastic (but not in an annoying way) and friendly, even to a foreigner with poor Spanish such as myself. They run around like mad because they are so booked but have a huge smile on their face and are never dismissive of you even in the busiest of moments.",
