    "We were waiting outside when the doors finally opened a little after 9. \u00a0We had a big day planned so a big breakfast was perfect. \u00a0Based on previous reviews of the restaurant we knew what we wanted to order. \u00a0Eggs Benedict and Huevos Rancheros.Eggs Benedict is my most favorite breakfast and have eaten many in my life. \u00a0This is a very good Eggs Benedict. \u00a0Not my best Eggs Benedict but the bar is pretty high right now. \u00a0I would go and order it again. \u00a0Quite possibly the best Eggs Benedict in Barcelona. \u00a0Hubs had the Huevos Rancheros. \u00a0It was also very good.Both were very filling and definitely worth the price.So go here! \u00a0and Enjoy!",
