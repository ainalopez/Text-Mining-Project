    "Cornelia and Co was an awesome experience. It was the type of fresh, inventive, spirited concept that we had come to expect from Barcelona based on our last trip, but had been disappointed not to find on this one.The first thing you're struck by at Cornelia and Co are the scale and scope of the operation; the space itself is expansive and so too is the array of offerings, as it seems they are set up as something of a market during the day.You'll then notice that the decor is spot on, save for a few notable, disturbing misses right when you step in the door. The menu itself is pretty standard, although we were glad to see that they departed from some old standbys and introduced some unique flavors and dishes to the tried and true.We ate octopus with oil and spices, which was one of my favorite dishes of the whole trip (Margaret Ann thought it was too salty), scallops, which were good, not great, pesto tagliatelle, which was perfectly cooked and extremely fresh, and apple tartin, which was amazing.The staff was very good, especially Joaquin who was kind and helpful before, during and after our dinner, taking time to help us decide where to eat paella the following day.Great experience!",
