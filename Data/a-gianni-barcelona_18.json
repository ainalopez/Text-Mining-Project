    "This place is really good! The home made pasta dish I had was delicious, and so was the steak my husband had. They spoke English which is very helpful and the service was some of the best we have had during our month long stay in Barcelona. I liked it so much, I went there twice. It was a nice getaway from the Spanish tapas every other place offers.",
