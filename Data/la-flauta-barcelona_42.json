    "Eixample is full of great places to eat. But you have to find the best if you want to take back with you the sweetest gastromemories Barcelona has to offer. This time, La Flauta totally did it for me.We were OK with sitting by the bar, so we got seated in 10 minutes. Of course, the line was 20 people strong so we just went for what we got. The next hour was just pure gastrobliss.High quality ingredients and exceptional cooking will distinguish this place from just about anything similar you might find in London, so be prepared to come back to bad-tapas-land. I went through it, and I am warning you well in advance.From the essential Catalan kitchen come fresh cod with olive oil and crushed tomatoes. Doesn't get better.The seafood platter (there's nothing like that, you just create one) will amaze you. Again - quality, quality, quality (of ingredients)!! Porc with 3 cheese.We received 5 star service with the guy at the bar/kitchen where we were seated, explaining the Catalan menu and the food in great detail. Very friendly, very interested and educated staff. Kudos!More points to La Flauta for the Pulpo a la Gallego (Galician Octopus). If you can make me like Octopus (tastes like rubber), you're doing the right thing.",
