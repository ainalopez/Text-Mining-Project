    "Having tried this place at the END of my trip after some other very amazing food discoveries --- this was not at all my favorite. Mediocre. Grilled cuttlefish (sepionas plancha) was pretty good, but not as bright and delicious as grilled seafood had elsewhere. Recommend you order this.Cheese and chorizo sandwich -- meh. Tortilla patatas (potatoes in egg dish) meh. Don't order this.Huevos cabreados (fried potato sticks with spicy sauce and eggs) -- a dish we tried everywhere -- were ok. Order it, as it seemed to be one of the better things on the menu, but know you'll have something better elsewhere.Anchovies were okay; nothing special. Don't bother ordering.Mini hamburgers were actually pretty good, if a bit greasy, especially because after a day or two if you're American you'll be craving something like a burger. :) Order this.",
