    "We dined in this Gastrobar located behind a small square in a calm street on a Saturday night (we hadn't made a reservation).The manager found us a table very quickly and we were served in only a few minutes.Every tapas was good, original, and a great size to share.We recommend the patatas bravas, the jamon iberico, the pimientos de padr\u00f3n (little green peppers you see everywhere in Spain) and our favorite: the pumpkin ravioli with dried tomatoes. For dessert, they are all modern: the destructed crumble was my favorite and the cheesecake was also very good. Everything is homemade. Smiley staff (some members speak English). Cool place that changes from all the traditional tapas bars.",
