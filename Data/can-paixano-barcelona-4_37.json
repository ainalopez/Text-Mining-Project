    "You probably won't find anywhere as good as this place. Amazing tapas, great prices, and you will probably want to sit for hours trying all of them. Amazing service and a great atmosphere. The only issue is that it is very crowded, there are no seats and you need to find a place at the bar. Overall, best place in Barcelona, and it is necessary to go try it out!",
