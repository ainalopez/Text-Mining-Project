    "Ahhh la catrina all compliments: the service, the price and the atmosphere. We all had the lunch special. Mine was a tomato based soup mildly spiced with pieces of chicharon and \u00a0crisp corn taco shells. The entree was beef with chimichurrie sauce and fries, dessert was a brownie. \u00a0All, the food was great. The handsome servers was the icing on the cake. \u00a0What a delightful lunch.",
