    "TOTAL RIP OFF! \u20ac50 We waited 1 hour for a small plate of mediocre \"Jabugo\" ham. Spanish ham should be cut thing by hand (it is also ok with machine if is a leg without bone) but this was so thin that you could see your fingers through it when holding it. Very small plate, 5 pieces of \"Pa de vidre\" (thin bread with scrubbed tomato) and small plate off thin cheese (it was \"sweeting\") and 3 \"medianas\" for drink.",
