    "Three is a generous rating for this restaurant but there's no half stars so we'll go with this. \u00a0There seems to be a bit of a disconnect between the kitchen and the front staff, because while the food is amazing the staff is subpar. We were waiting for a solid five minutes for someone to come to the welcome stand and seat us, and when a waitress did come she was quite snotty and rude to us. We ordered nine oysters and the black truffle omelette to start, the oysters were fresh and came with a simple vinaigrette and the omelette was light and fluffy. The waitress took her time helping his and just overall seemed displeased whenever she had to talk to us. Our entrees were both amazing and horrible. Two people did not like their orders of sea food paella and suckling lambs, the lamb was bony and bland. The seafood paella just tasted like seawater, really briny and disappointing. However, the three of us that really liked their orders got the whole chicken with potatoes at gratin, Angus ribs with potato pur\u00e9e, and veal cheeks and veggies, all highly recommended! We were disappointed by the service since we were the only people in the restaurant for our whole experience, and the way we were treated since we try to be nice guests and not obnoxious tourists. However, the meat dishes and appetizers were delectable. I would recommend drinks and the fresh oysters here since the restaurant is beautiful and cool.",
