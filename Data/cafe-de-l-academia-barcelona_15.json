    "TLDR:- Charming restaurant in the Gothic Quarter. Incredible Catalan food with French and Italian accents.- Appetizers: house salad, eggplant terrine, Catalan bean soup.- Mains: quail with foie gras and pate, rack of lamb.- The quail - meltingly delicious. - The lamb - served with slowly-cooked pear slices and a little butter cracker - was ridiculously tender and substantial with every bite. The delightful reduction rounded out the dish nicely with the right touch of sweetness and subtle sharpness.- Desserts: fluffy, light cheesecake topped with a tangy berry marmalade and a well-constructed cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.- Service is top-notch and the decor is chic and rustic.",
