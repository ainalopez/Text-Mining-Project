    "Terrible service! Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and was very disappointed. Waited forever at the bar while others got their drinks and eventually I just gave up. The rudest bartenders and waiters I have ever seen.I have family in Barcelona and have been coming here for 20 years and I can tell you this - with so many wonderful restaurants in this great city I wouldn't waste my time or money on this one.",
