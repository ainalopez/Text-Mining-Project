    "My boyfriend has spent a week in Japan every year for the last 15 years. He ordered miso ramen and said that if he closed his eyes he would swear he was in Japan. I had some gyoza that was amazing - fresh, crunchy on the outside and soft (but not gooey) on the inside, and really delicious. The atmosphere is fun and friendly though a little cramped, as they have crammed as many tables as possible inside. We sat at the bar along the wall and the waitress had to wedge herself past me to serve the table behind me. OK, no biggie. But then the table got something super garlicky and it really stunk to high heaven.",
