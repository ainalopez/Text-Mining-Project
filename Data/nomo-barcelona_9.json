    "Nomo was recommended to me by someone when I was visiting Barcelona. Being an avid sushi fan and having been to many great sushi restaurants (including having sushi at Morimoto) I was of course a bit skeptical that the restaurant would be as good as it was described to me. I'm happy to say it was THE BEST sushi I've ever had in my life. The flavors were pronounced, delicious, and balanced. And the creativity and sheer craftsmanship in the presentation is unmatched. I sat at the sushi bar on my second visit just so I could watch the sushi chefs prepare the food. They are artists, period. If you go, you must try the foie gras and eel roll. It was amazing. They had a special preparation with uni the night I was there. I've never been a big fan of uni, but their dish won me over. It's always pretty busy, but the servers are very attentive. If you want an amazing sushi experience, you have to try this place. It saddens me that I can't go back whenever I want to go. If this place were near me, they'd be getting almost all of my dining out budget.",
