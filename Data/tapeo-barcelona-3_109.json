    "This place is fabulous! The owner/Chef Daniel is so friendly and was happy to chat with us and make recommendations about the menu. The waiters we had both times we were there were also friendly so I have to say I disagree with the reviews that say they felt like they were \"stuffy and uptight.\" It does get crowded but that's part of the fun! Do not miss this amazing food!! We even had a second portion of the ribs for \"dessert\" one visit :)",
