    "I really wanted to like this place. On paper it looked great! Excellent rating on Yelp, extremely close to my hotel, trip advisor sticker in the window, decent decor, plenty of people inside (though not full by any means)... And friendly staff.So why only 2 stars?Well, I wrote the other day about a taps place that I thought was expensive, but at least the food was good.This place felt expensive too. Admittedly I did order more dishes, but they were smaller and I ended up paying about 35 euros.The problem was the foot just wasn't very good.I had a beer from the tap that felt watered down. The Russian salad had tuna in it, quite odd for a Russian salad, but it was fairly tasty so ok. The chipirones had hardly any batter on them and some tasted really weird... But the worst thing was the octopus. I normally love octopus, but this was terrible. It was super oily and super salty. The saltiest food I ever ate. It was so salty that the beer started to taste funny because of the extreme saltiness of the food.I really hope it was a one-off bad day for the chef or something, as the staff were really nice!But I can still taste the salt in my mouth 2 hours later :(",
