    "When in Spain, and specially in Barcelona, the last thing I may want to have is a burger. I live in Houston and we have great burgers in town. Also, Spanish food in general is outstanding. Regardless of the region in Spain, the cult and passion for food is extreme. I know, I am just about to talk about a burger, but it totally took me by surprise finding such a well crafted burger in Barcelona. Everything seems done in-house and the quality of the ingredients are excellent. \u00a0Please note that this place is very close to some of the best dives I've tried in Barcelona (e.g., el Vaso de Oro and Can Paixano), and it became a must for my next visit. \u00a0I had a simple cheese burger with bacon, but there wasn't anything simple about it. From the bun to the patty and everything in between, this burger was outstanding. Will definitely try again in my next visit.",
