    "Where does the time go!? \u00a0I feel like we just returned from the beautiful city of Barcelona yesterday! Unfortunately, that's not the case and I am super behind on my reviews! \u00a0Oops! \u00a0I'd like to preface by disclosing the underwhelming feeling I had leaving 85% of restaurants in Barcelona. \u00a0As a United States native, I am aware of the stigma Americans get for being narrow-minded in regard to other cultures. \u00a0However, I feel I truly do my best to learn, understand and appreciate as many cultures as I can. \u00a0I don't know where along the path I dropped the ball, but when it came to Spanish cuisine - I will be the first to admit - I missed the memo that every restaurant would be serving the same variety of tapas/pinchos just on different platters and sometimes at different costs.... with the exception of one restaurant in L'Eixample called \"NAPA\". \u00a0And here's how we discovered it ... After an exhausting day of sightseeing, my husband & I reluctantly got ready and hit the streets of Barcelona to celebrate New Year's Eve. \u00a0Without a plan in mind, but \"hangry\" tummies on the line, we passed far too many dining opportunities and started to become discouraged. \u00a0Not but a couple minutes later, my husband pointed out a sign across the street that simply read \"NAPA\". \u00a0I asked him \"Could it be? Could it be Napa as in California 'Napa'? \u00a0Like, American Napa??\" \u00a0It didn't take but a few more steps to recognize the grapes etched on the streak-free glass doors to confirm we finally found a place we'd both enjoy! \u00a0Like many other restaurants in Barcelona, NAPA displayed the evening's menu outside the restaurant: Starter: \u00a0Crab-Stuffed Avocado Roll \u00a0 -YEPFirst: \u00a0Grilled Lime Shrimp Skewers \u00a0 -YEPSecond: \u00a0Peanut Butter & Jelly Foie Gras Bombons \u00a0 -YEPThird: \u00a0Iberian Bacon-Wrapped Scallops with Sweet Pea Puree \u00a0 -YEPFourth: \u00a0Miso-Marinated Alaska Black Cod with Wakame Seaweed Salad \u00a0 -YEPFifth: \u00a0Steak Sirloin with Truffle & Trompetas de la Muerte Sauce \u00a0 -YEPDessert: \u00a0Housemade Cannelloni \u00a0 -YEP... Using the menu as a fair foreshadow, no one had to ask me twice to try it out! \u00a0I gathered NAPA to be a New American concept fusing the likes of fresh Californian ingredients with traditional Spanish/Catalan family-style cuisine (aka: \u00a0best of both worlds) and they proved my theory to be correct! \u00a0 \u00a0 The trick was to see if they had room for us. \u00a0Sure enough, we arrived late enough that after a very short wait, we were seated in their cozy main dining area. \u00a0We were greeted right away with a warm, creamy Truffle Risotto amuse bouche! \u00a0It was lovely and everything I needed! \u00a0Honestly, all courses served featured the perfect balance of flavors from both cuisines to satisfy my 'wanderlusting' palate! \u00a0#happygirlBut the food wasn't the only aspect of NAPA that harmoniously fused American & Catalan ideologies... and we have the owners to thank for that! \u00a0The female owner is American and the male owner is Catalan. \u00a0Around 11:50pm, the female owner dropped off party supplies and a plate of 12 grapes. \u00a0Adam & I chuckled because we had no clue what this was for! \u00a0We hoped maybe NAPA turned into a club after midnight. \u00a0Haha. \u00a0Moments later she returned with the male owner who educated us on the Catalan tradition of consuming one grape per second leading up to the turn of midnight. \u00a0They explained the wanted to stay true to all NYE traditions... and attempting to do it all made for the best comic relief for both us and the young German couple we met in the restaurant. \u00a0So how did we ring in the New Year? \u00a0Wearing brightly colored masks on our face, a glass of champagne in hand, and a mouth-full of grapes barely allowing our lips to kiss at the stroke of midnight, aside the most hospitable group of service staff ever!  \u00a0In conclusion, if you too want to experience the flavors of Catalonia but with a wider variety of plates, head to NAPA next time you're in Barcelona. \u00a0I can honestly say - you will not be disappointed!",
