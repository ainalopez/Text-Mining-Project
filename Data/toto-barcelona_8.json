    "Woah. This place was incredible, so good we actually went back two nights later. It was very close to our hotel and got good reviews so we decided make a a reservation and check it out. We were actually greeted by the manager/owner and were seated immediately and even asked if the table location was good enough for us. They brought out a complimentary bread basket with three types of bread and the best olive oil with a rosemary garnish. We ordered a bottle of wine and sampled it first. We ordered the beet salad and prime rib for two. The beet salad was so good we got it the next time we went and even recommended it to the table next to us. Before our main course came out our waiter brought us out complimentary gazpacho. The prime rib came on a cast iron skillet so we were able to finish the meat to our liking. We even got dessert, we asked the waiter what kind of cheese cakes he had and he said one moment i'll show you and came back with two full pies in his hands. As the service goes, lets just say at one point I stood up to go to the bathroom and my phone fell on the floor before I could even reach down the manager was handing it to me. Another time the breeze blew the window in and almost knocked over a glass the manager ran over and not only locked our window shut but shut every other window. I shook the managers hand both times as we were leaving.Just make a reservation even if it is not busy because they reserve the better tables further in the restaurant with a view of the open kitchen or else you'll kind of sit near the bar area and not really in the heart of the place. And if I had to make one critique is that our red wine was served in a white wine glass. The place is a little pricey about $100 for a couple, but it is well worth it.",
