    "In Barcelona and looking for a great craft beer pub with outstanding food to wash the beer down with? You'll find it here. Ten taps not enough for you? \u00a0How about thirty? - with a huge selection of bottled offerings as well. \u00a0The waiters are great - good humored, particularly about how bad your Catalan or Spanish is, and very knowledgeable about their product. \u00a0Barcelona has nailed wine/tapas/etc. Its denizens are jumping into craft beer with both feet, and BierCaB is the vanguard. The ambience is cool/hipster but friendly, the prices are incredibly low, the tech is more up to date than the vast majority of Portland/Brooklyn/Denver/Asheville gastropubs.....and it's Barcelona. What's not to like? \u00a0To be fair, I'm not sure about their sangria.",
