    "Short on local ambiance but long on sophisticated dishes, for English-speaking visitors, Windsor offers an indulgent treat. \u00a0The Time Out guide book nailed it when they mentioned that English banker frequent the place. We had just rolled into town that night so we went with it anyway, based on the emphasis on creative cuisine and proximity to our hotel. We loved our meals (chilled ox heart soup -- really -- and foie gras/duck appetizer, then lamb, fish for mains) but rued our seating. We were in clear ear shot of a NJ banker and his wife, regaling colleagues of their hyper-mundane \"expat\" stories. \u00a0The wait staff and particularly the sommelier were really outstanding. He gently guided us to a Mauro, an interesting alternative to our standard Riojas. \u00a0Would still eat here again, apart from the fact that there are dozens of great places yet to explore that would deliver an authentic Spanish/Catalan feel.",
