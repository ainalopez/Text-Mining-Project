    "Cool bar!! It's a tiny place. The first day my friend and I landed in Barcelona and we got to talking with this couple next to us at dinner and before we knew it we were drinking a bottle of wine with them (people in Barcelona are super friendly) They recommended we check this place out immediately! So we headed here around midnight and it wasn't packed. Actually I think we were the only ones there. We grabbed a couple seats at the bar. The bartenders knew we weren't from there (first off no one goes to bar at midnight that's wayyy too early in Europe. Why does bars close at 2am in LA?? ugh so lame) and I'm pretty sure we smelled like tourist lol! They have a bunch of very unique drinks to try and each one was created with a lot of thought and craftsmanship. The bartenders were amazing and skilled. All the juices and ingredients for the drinks were freshly squeezed or prepared. By 3am we were pretty buzzed and the place was soooo packed I had to really push my way to the restroom which was like 3 steps from the bar. We were packed in that small little bar like sardines but we definitely had some good laughs with random people we met and ended up doing shots with the bartenders as well!",
