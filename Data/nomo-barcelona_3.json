    "The food was acceptably good, but customer service received from the Host was the worst I have experienced in 5 years eating out in Bcn (and I must stress that I am a frequent restaurant-goer ). \u00a0He was specially rude, bossy, unhelpful, unreasonable, unpolite and arrogant. \u00a0Restaurant owner must consider replacing this employee or providing him with proper training. Will never come back to this place. Sorry that the waiters did not get any tip, but it is the Host to blame.",
