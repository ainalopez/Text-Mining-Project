    "This was our first dinner in Barcelona thanks to our concierge....it was so good, we made it our last meal in Barcelona as well this trip. \u00a0The service was friendly and attentive, but the cod dinner was the best we had in three countries. \u00a0Combined with the seafood risotto, we were speechless over the flavors and the freshness. \u00a0Surprisingly, after reviewing my bank statements at home, this was one of the least expensive dinners as well! \u00a0Can't wait to start another Barcelona adventure here again!",
