    "Visited upon recommendation of a college friend (a NYT food critic), and I'm sure glad I took her advice (she steered me away from Adria's Tickets, which is oft-criticized for its pretentiousness). \u00a0Michelin stars, check. \u00a0Flawless service, check. \u00a0Amazing food, check. \u00a0Was it the most amazing fine dining meal I've ever had? \u00a0Not quite. \u00a0Those honors still go to Le Bernardin and Per Se in NYC. \u00a0But AbAC definitely lived up to the hype. \u00a0I opted for the chef's tasting menu (pricey at 125 euro, but I was on vacation, plus it's par for the course for this level of cuisine/service), along with a customized wine pairing with the sommelier's help. \u00a0Staff is fantastic, helpful, fluent in English, and not at all overbearing or pretentious, which is a plus. \u00a0Worth going out of the way to visit when you're in Barcelona, especially if there's a special occasion.",
