    "I am very impressed by the food and experience here. Staff were very attentive and explained each dish in great detail. Each dish is a gastronomic experience.Be warned, the endless stream of food can be overwhelming, after the tenth course you kinda feel woozy from food & alcohol but the food keeps coming & it doesn't help that the restaurant was dark and illuminated with streaks of alien-like blue fluorescent lights",
