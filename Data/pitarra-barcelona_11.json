    "6/28/2012Had one of the best meals here I've enjoyed in a long time. Relaxing , untouristy setting with an old world motif. The cheese and mushroom starter was a stand out at the beginning which we split on the recommendation of the server, as most appetizers were quite large. We also shared a spectacular avocado salad with salmon and topped with caviar and a vinaigrette that was elegant in presentation and flavorful. The mixed seafood paella that followed was also sufficient for two. Several types of seafood were present in abundance, enough for a taste in each fork full. My only quibble was that it was slightly overcooked. Service was friendly and attentive as well. For what you get, the price is very fair. Go! You'll like or love it enough to want an encore.",
