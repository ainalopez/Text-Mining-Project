    "Fantastic service (especially for English speakers) and amazing food. The ingredients they use really give you a feel for the environment these dishes come from - fish from the sea, vegetables from the mountain. The waitstaff helped us through our order and gave us extensive descriptions on the plates. Was the best meal on our entire Europe trip!",
