    "Really great food and drinks here, and so close to Barceloneta beach. It's really just a good place to sit down at the end of the day, relax with some drinks (they have quite the drink selection) and good, local food. Seafood is easily their specialty, and they do it well. My favorite dish was their little fried shrimp and also their OLIVES which they give you when you sit down, no matter what you order. Very reasonable prices too which was nice!",
