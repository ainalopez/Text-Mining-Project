    "Went there to celebrate a new job as I was told that it's one of the best restaurants in Barcelona. So maybe my expectations where too high. The wine was good, the rest was..average at best. Maybe it's because there was not a single Spanish person there but only tourists? Or maybe there are only tourists because the Spanish don't go there for a good reason. The starters were tasteless, I had the paella which I hoped would be good but honestly was really disapointing... The wine was good though. Service was average. At least we did not pay too much, but more than I would ever spend on an average dinner. I can definitively \u00a0not recommend this. However it's pretty, and in a historical building. So maybe just go there for sharing a good bottle of wine and some seafood, and then move on to a tapas place where the real food experience will happen.",
