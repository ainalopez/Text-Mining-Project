    "I will start with the best part first- their profitroles dessert was delicious! This dish saved them from my wrath of giving lower than a 3/5. I was excited to check this place out, as the reviews are pretty great. However, I did not have a very good experience. They have a large menu and my husband and I were viewing it. We are both English speakers and so we had to look closely at the menu to see the smaller font translations. The owner, who I was actually a bit excited to meet when he first came over, was not hospitable. He asked \"Are you ready to order?\" and we said \"Can we have a couple of more minutes?\" His response then was \"You still need a couple of minutes? You have been looking for 15 minutes now.\" I thought this was EXTREMELY rude, as there was no way it had been 15 minutes and his tone was not very friendly. After we ordered and he could see I was upset, he tried to be nicer... which did not win me over at all. The food was definitely not all that great and it was super pricey. I would never go here again.",
