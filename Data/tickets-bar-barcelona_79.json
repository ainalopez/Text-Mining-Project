    "an amazing not-to-be-missed experience...there were many items from el bulli menu. (now closed)all was mostly just small 1 item things for tasting.we started with 6 \"olives\" which was an amazing start...weird and wild and delicious. what you expect from ferran...we had a \"oyster with its pearl\" which was a great oyster with a pearl of smokey taste. - \u00a0 also a bit wild.anchovie with tomato seeds - \u00a0very good - but not mind blowing.then a ham+ potato thing we had was good but on level we were at was almost disappointing. the squid was a big hitwe ordered 2 plates. a must. - \u00a0prob. our have item.the manchego \"airbag\" i loved.\"liquid ravioli\" was pretty great. gambas- peel + eat . ok but will try something else next timegran reserva jam\u00f3n iberico- excellent, but as i live in spain i am accustomed to excellent cured meats so...do get pan con tomate...i know i must be forgetting something....just each touch was well looked after.really another level from virtually anyplace else...in all sensesdesserts were amazing: a choc hazelnet bon bon type thing mmmm so good with the red wine!and a \"cheesecake\" that was unlike any other and fantastic.looking at the fotos....food looks fancy/fussy... i know. i saw photos on the web and had serious doubts...but so many positive reviews...we had to try it at least once...now we will go back of course!we had 4 glasses of winesome great reds... all wines were avail by the glass, nice touchplus we started with that \"ferran adria\" estrella beer .5 literdinner for 2 w/drinks service tax etc...and we did not scrimp at all , went pretty full on.... 165 eurolooking forward to our next visit!!!",
