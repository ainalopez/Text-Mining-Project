    "Nothing short of extraordinary. The most amazing THIN SANDWICH ever, which you must eat with a fork and a knife. - The pan (bread) was so thin, buttery and nicely toasted. The morcilla is one of my weaknesses and it was just rightly irony and sweet. The most special pepita was the GOLD PEPITA with foie gras (extra charge) with steak. Fatty, oily, meaty, throw on the fried egg, let it leak. Who in the world comes up with this ridiculous creation? God bless them. It was excellent.- Also had the pumkin seed walnut salad with a pear gazpacho. Refreshing and on point. - The Tuna pepita was very good too, got it for our pescatarian friend, I think I was mostly blown away by the morcilla one that everything just couldn't keep up.- Grilled pulpo over mashed potatoes. Lemony and Herby. Good stuff. - Fried Goat Cheese with sliced green apple. This was nice and smoky, good but I prefer the pepitas. They close early, so don't come within an hour of closing, they will start cleaning up with you in the table still. Write on the wall and leave your mark (ask for markers); the place is as fun as it gets.I cannot wait to come back for more. If only I didn't live in the US, meh. We need this!",
