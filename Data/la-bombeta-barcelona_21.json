    "Excellent, small restaurant for tapas! \u00a0Everything I got off the menu was good and came out quick. \u00a0Their signature \"Las Bombas\" \u00a0were the best...a friend potato ball, cut in half and drizzled in a delicious sauce. \u00a0It gets crowded at night, so stick to lunch. \u00a0Most of the waiters dont speak English, but you will get by with their translated menu. \u00a0I actually went every day I was in Barcelona for a snack.",
