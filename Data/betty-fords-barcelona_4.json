    "One of my go-to drink spots in Raval. The beers are cheap, the cocktails are delicious, and the Australian owner is always fun to chat with. Best drink on the menu is the Chile Mule... Made with fresh ginger, cucumber, and fire water, it's spicy and refreshing. I always wonder how they manage to serve burgers and fries with their seriously tiny kitchen. The food is decent but this place is all atmosphere. It's cozy and dark, perfect place to catch up with friends or meet for a not-so-awkward first date.",
