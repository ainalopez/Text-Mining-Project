    "Quaint and cozy and also the place I spent my last night in Barcelona after 7 months.The dates and bravas are tasty, the drinks are delicious, and the specials (Tapa Tuesday, Mojito Monday, etc.) are great for Barcelona. It's small but charming and easy to miss. That doesn't mean you should pass it up.Weekend brunches get busy, so make a reservation if you can. The breakfast burritos, french toast, and the mimosas were a great combo for our brunch. The service is good, the food is better, and the atmosphere is the best part of it all (they have notebooks you can doodle in, a vintage/antique decor, and board games).If you want a more relaxed, down-to-earth, and intimate place to hang, Timeline is the place to be.",
