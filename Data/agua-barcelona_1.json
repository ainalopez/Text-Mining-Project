    "Another fantastic choice for us. We went for a leisurely lunch while in Spain for a conference. The location on the waterfront was a gorgeous setting and the food was equally perfect.We all ordered tapas- each better than the last. Then I got one of the best salads I've had inSpain. It was fresh, light and perfect to round out the meal.",
