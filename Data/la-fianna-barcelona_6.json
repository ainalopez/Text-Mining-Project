    "This place is in the heart of El Borne, the most popular drinking area amongst young trendy Catalans. The area per se is gorgeous- it is basically the heart of the city i.e. the old part of town. It is fun getting lost on the small cobbled streets that will suddenly spill onto a stunning ancient piazza. Try and make your own way to this stunning bar which is a true gem. Outside the door it has real fire lanterns which will guide you to the entrance and the interior is a treat to the eyes. It is decorated in the most stunning dark velvety reds and dark wood and raw stone walls. There are comfy sofas on which people literally like down they are that comfy! Or you can stand at the bar if you are in the mood for a more buzzing atmosphere or indeed take a seat in the beautiful restaurant and have a bite to eat, where believe it or not, there is a lot more to chose from- not just tapas!",
