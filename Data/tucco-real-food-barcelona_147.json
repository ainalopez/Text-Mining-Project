    "Great place for fresh food!! We were a big fan of the ravioli special. You get a drink, entree, empanadas and dessert for a little over 10 euro. It was a great deal. The staff and the food was perfect. The only issue I had with it was location. We left late and it felt a little darky and sketchy down the winding alleys of Barcelona.",
