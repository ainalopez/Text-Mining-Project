    "My wife and her aunt and I are vacationing in Barcelona, renting an apartment for ten days. \u00a0We were looking for a quiet simple place to enjoy some appetizers and wine, and this place really fit the bill. \u00a0They have a great atmosphere that feels a bit like a wine cellar, a good selection of wine with emphasis on Spanish wines. \u00a0We had a terrific cheese platter with four cheeses from different regions of Spain, and served with a pepper jam and nuts. \u00a0Greek-style dolmades with tzaziki (stuffed grape leaves and favored yogurt) were really, really excellent. \u00a0Dried chorizo was very good. Foie gras was fabulous, and the rustic, crusty bread that accompanied it was its equal. The simple pan y tomate was the best we've had in Barcelona. Prices were very reasonable. \u00a0We will be back here before we finish our vacation. This is not a full restaurant, but you will have a hard time beating it for Greek appetizers and wine.",
