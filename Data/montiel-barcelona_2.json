    "Outstanding Experience! We ordered the Gastronomic Menu which was superb! All the food was interesting, creative and absolutely delicious. Gabriel was our waiter, a very sweet, charming and professional young man, who explained each dish and yet left some to our senses to figure out. Each dish was not only for taste, but was for smell, touch (texture) and really had your mind inquisitive. The courses build on each other, a really fantastic, unique experience. Do make a stop here!We did not do the wine pairing but ordered Shays white wine, at the recommendation of the manager. It went well with everything except the last dessert. Total dishes that came out was 10.I also would like to thank the manager as we had made a reservation but appears it never went through and maybe I did not finalize the process. I showed him the screen shot I had of the pre-booking (which I thought was the booking) from a week earlier and he worked with us. Just make sure call/email ahead to confirm reservation.Other notes: the whole experience was over 2 hours and location is near Picasso Museum.",
