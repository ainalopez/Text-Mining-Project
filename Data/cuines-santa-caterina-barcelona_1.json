    "My boyfriend and I came here after or Gaudi tour under the suggestion of our tour guide. It's a very cute, rustic looking restaurant that reminds of a beer hall. Their menu is a fusion of all different tastes around the world. It's literally a matrix!I ordered the shrimp spicy noodle, and my boyfriend ordered a chicken curry. Both were very very good. I feel like this place does a very good job with all their dishes overall. So if your looking for a non-tapas restaurant that will please a big group, this is your spot! Prices are reasonable (for Barcelona). Definitely hit the spot after a hungry day's worth of touring!",
