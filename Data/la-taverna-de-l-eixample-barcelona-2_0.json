    "Hands down the best guacamole I've had in Europe since living here the past year. \u00a0It has been a long search but it was worth it.Came back again to sample some more of the tapas and was not dissapointed. \u00a0I ordered the Potatoes Bravas with shredded beef and it was mouthwateringly delicious. \u00a0It actually made me put down the fork to write this review.",
