    "I am writing this review as I finish up my dinner here at Bar Mut and I must say that even with the 5 star reviews, this place exceeded my expectations. I have been exploring all of Europe and trying all sorts of highly recommended restaurants and I can say without a doubt that the service here exceeds everywhere else in Spain or in Europe in general. The food was amazing (of course, that's the most important part), but the service is what really takes everything to another level. The servers will help you pick the perfect menu item(s) for you based on your tastes and their favorites and let me tell you, you will not leave disappointed.If you are in Barcelona, check out Bar Mut! It's in the middle of all the great shopping :)",
