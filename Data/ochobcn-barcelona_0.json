    "This is probably the best food we have had while in Barcelona. Not only was the food delicious, but the entire staff was incredibly friendly. They were very accommodating to our gringo english speaking selves and didn't make us feel bad for not speaking their language very well :) Get one of the steaksor the pork. Or anything for that matter - I'm sure you won't be disappointed!",
