    "AMAZING!!Not a very good dinner place but you have to go to this bar if you are in Barcelona. Its magic! They only serve whole bottles until 5pm but one glass of cava costs between 1-1,7\u20ac and a bottle costs from 3-6\u20ac. You might have to wait outside for some time but its worth it. We waited in line for about 15 min. the que was very fast. You have to order the chorizo",
