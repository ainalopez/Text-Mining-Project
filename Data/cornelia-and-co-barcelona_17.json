    "Fantastic expereince. \u00a0Fun atmosphere with decor setting it apart from the norm. \u00a0Staff was very friendly, helped pick out dishes and very attentive to detail. \u00a0Started with the Burrata cheese, it is a must! By far best we ever had! For enttees we had the fresh, in house made, spaghetti with cherry tomatoes and fresh basil & tellagoti with pesto and basil. \u00a0Both were marvelous and bursting with flavor! For desert we had the truffles, excellent, and lemon creme pie, also excellent. \u00a0A must stop while in Barcelona. Our waiter was a nice guy from Italy with a terrific beard!",
