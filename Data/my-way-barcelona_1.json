    "Good food, good atmosphere.The waitstaff was really nice and we were promptly seated. We started out with the house red wine- it was good but not my favorite, have been pretty spoiled last week with the Italy house wines. We shared appetizers with our friends- fried calamari, octopus on potatoes, and mussels. The waitress suggested a filet for me- it came with mushrooms and potatoes. The flavor of the meat was really good but could have been a bit more tender. My husband had the chicken thighs and loved them. I tried my friend's seafood paella and it was really good. My friend's husband had a tuba steak- he thought the portion size was rather small. We didn't have dessert but they sounded good. I gave this place 4 stars because although it was overall really good, I wouldn't say it was outstanding.",
