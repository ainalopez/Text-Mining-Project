    "I ordered the cava rosado, chorizo and hamburger.I really wanted to like this place because of all the good reviews. There was just something about this place that I didn't really like. Maybe it was how crowded it was or how dirty the floors were. The cheap, greasy food (especially the chorizo) didn't really make up for the crowded-ness. It took a while before we were even able to push to the front to order our drinks and food. The menu is also hard to see. You are literally pushing people just to read the menu (that is not english friendly) I didn't think the food was that great either. Sure, the cava was cheap but there are tons of cheap food places in Barcelona, I would not recommend this one. I could see how it could be a local hang out spot but when you're hungry and you want some food and decent service, I would not come here.",
