    "This is the best meal we've had in Barcelona!Food is so delicious that you'll need a personal moment to savor the taste after the first bites of ... just about every tapas plate that graces your table. Vibe is lively yet chill. Servers/bartenders are fun and friendly. Sangria is divine. Limoncello shot at the end is perfect. See you when I return ;)",
