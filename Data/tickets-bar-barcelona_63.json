    "Yes, excellent. \u00a0Let the waiter choose our menu. \u00a0Did well with avoiding lactose, except in dessert. \u00a0The desserts are BEAUTIFUL but expensive and small. \u00a0All the dinner dishes were great. \u00a0Suitable for families. \u00a0Also for special date. \u00a0Tried pakta the next night which I also recommend. \u00a0(Owner is the same)",
