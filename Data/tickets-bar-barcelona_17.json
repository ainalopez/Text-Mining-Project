    "As Out of towners that going to just spend a Weekend in Barcelona, My Yelp friend just have one request, it was to visit Tickets Bar.My phone went off right at midnight (Barcelona time) 60 days before our actual day of visit to remind me to make our reservation on line... and I was glad everything went smoothly as planned and we going to eat at Tickets Bar!!Fast forward!The experience was really memorable as I don't have a chance to experience molecular gastronomy in Toronto. We got to sit right at the bar watching all the action where the kitchen preparing all the cold dish.We shared:Tickets' olive-SRazor clams with refried sauce and lemon airConfit potatoes with Iberian cured ham and pork rib jusEl Manteca\" double chin \"mollen\"High level\" Cow TenderloinConfit artichoke with quail egg yolk and salmon roeDessert: White chocolate and black sesame lava rock (presented on a pieces of rock)I really enjoy the playfulness and the presentation of all the dish we tried. Service was excellent and able to do 0.5/0.75 portion since we wanted to try more dish. The answer here is always yes, we can do it! This is what I mean by service!If you never been here, I would highly recommend you come to Tickets Bar and give it a try.",
