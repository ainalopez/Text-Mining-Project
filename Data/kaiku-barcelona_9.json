    "When our waitress came by to check up on us and asked how our meal went, I was completely in earnest when I told her in Spanish that it was possibly the best meal of my life. She looked startled but then pleased. I hoped she knew I meant every word. Don't bother with anything else other than the seafood. The seafood is extraordinary. Most of it I've never even seen before but everything was wonderful. Since the menu changes daily based on what's available at the markets, it's not guaranteed these dishes will be on the menu but at the time of our visit (April 2012), we had the Galeres (something akin to a Spot Prawn but with a meatier body yet more delicate flavor), Anemones (Tempura style with a bit of Honey and Lime), Escopinyes (Cockles with Tomato Water and Oilve Oil), Zamburinyes (a type of Baby Scallop), and the Arros Negre. The Arros Negre was really some kind of incredible. I typically do not enjoy Paella but this was unlike any Paella I had ever tasted. Inky black and topped with the most perfect shrimp in shell, squid, and mussels, my husband and I devoured the entire pan and kept looking back at it longingly even though we knew it was completely empty. To round out our meal, we requested a sampler of desserts to be made and those in turn were also very, very good. Simply amazing. Amazing. If anyone knows me, I can be quite wordy at times but really, there are no words. Just go.*A heads up- they are closed certain days of the week, only open for lunch, and reservations are highly recommended.",
