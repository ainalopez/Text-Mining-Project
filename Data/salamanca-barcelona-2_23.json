    "My wife read a review about the restaurant serving bread to customers who did not ask for it but got charged for it even when they did not touch it. It happened to us also--we were given a bread that we did not order, but by the time we saw the review, we already ate some of the bread. Since most restaurants do it for free, we thought they might not charge us but when the bill came in, we were charged us like 3.50 euros for the bread. We also tried to order the Paella House Special and since it was a bit pricey (about \u20ac33 per person), we thought of ordering one order of house special for one person and then order cheaper paella; however, we were told that we need a minimum of 2 orders for the Paella House Special. We really wanted to try it so we decided to order the house special for 2 persons. We paid a total of $78 (not including the tip) but I would not say that it was spectacular. We were given a free dessert in the end but the fact that he bought us the bread and charged us for it at the end left a bad taste in our mouths.",
