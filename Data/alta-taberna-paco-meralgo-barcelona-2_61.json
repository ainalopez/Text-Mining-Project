    "This was, without a doubt, the (very pleasant) surprise of our visit to Barcelona - we went to PM for dinner pretty much because they were the only place we could find that was open on Sunday night. \u00a0It was PACKED - good sign. \u00a0We sat at the bar and the service was fantastic - the staff all seemed to be working well together and actually having a good time doing so. \u00a0We enjoyed pan de tomate (by far the best version of our entire trip to Spain), razor clams, croquettes, garlic shrimp, rabbit, crema catalana, and pan con chocolate (with sea salt and olive oil) - all so simple, yet SO delicious. \u00a0All of the dishes were executed perfectly. \u00a0Had we not had other reservations for the remainder of our stay, we probably would have gone back - it was that good!",
