    "Super amazing restaurant that we found. Don't come here expecting a cheap meal because it won't happen. However it is well worth the price and the food is absolutely amazing. \u00a0 The owner is out working the tables and is a lovely gal to chat with. She's not opinionated but neither am I \u00a0:-) This is a great place come to have steak. Good steak. \u00a0 \u00a0Even though we were often looking for authentic Spanish food I found myself coming here entirely too much. This was the best restaurant I had on my trip to Barcelona. \u00a0Oh, If you sit outside expect to pay an extra two \u20ac50 for the pleasure.",
