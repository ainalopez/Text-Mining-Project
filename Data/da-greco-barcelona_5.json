    "Chef Grecco who personally took our order as his son is now in charge of the kitchen. The decor is lovely, staff very well trained and the food is some of the best of Barcelona. They do an interesting thing, when someone at the table orders pasta (all homemade and amazing) they bring an additional share plate so everyone at the table has a chance to try it. Highly recommend this place for italian food.",
