    "After a week in Barcelona, we were getting super sick of eating all of the ham and dried meats. Even the tapas bars and all that carb overload from the bread was starting to get to us. Imagine how happy my tummy was when my nose caught the scent of something delicious cooking! We had to go inside.Wok to Walk is a cool concept. It works sort of like Subway where there is a counter with a variety of fresh vegetables and other ingredients and you tell the person behind the counter what you want in your bowl. After that, chefs stir-fry it up right in front of you. There are many healthy choices as well as some not-so-healthy ones. There are a variety of sauces too.It is a little bit pricey for what you get, but the two of us shared one container and it made a filling snack. The chicken used was high quality and all white meat. The vegetables were tasty too.The interior looks a bit like Hooters with wood and orange coloring. Very weird for an Asian take-away. This is a tasty place and I really enjoyed my meal here.",
