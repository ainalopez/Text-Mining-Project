    "My favorite cheap tapas joint. \u00a0The food is very good -- not outstanding, but the prices cannot be beat. \u00a0A plate of pintxos and a beer or two ran 6-11 euros. \u00a0I was concerned about other yelp reviews that mentioned the young crowd -- this may be true later in the evening, but both times I visited it was a wide mix of ages. \u00a0Lots of locals, and the waitstaff was clearly having fun, dancing and singing to the '90s music and getting amped up for the busier night scene. \u00a0Favorite pintxos had chorizo, salmon or goat cheese with a red pepper spread. \u00a0Went great with an Estella Lemon. \u00a0Was not a fan of the ham croquette -- it was soggy.",
