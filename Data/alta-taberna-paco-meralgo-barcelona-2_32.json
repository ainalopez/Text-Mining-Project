    "Fantastic, upscale tapas restaurant in Barcelona. Being Americans we showed up at around what I consider to be normal dinner time (8pm) and realized this is more or less the early bird special/senior citizen dinner hour for Barcelona. The plus side? No wait and 100% of the staff's attention. Few highlights:Pepper and garlic sizzing steak - delicious! Tender, perfectly seasoned and downright outstanding.Fried artichokes - yum! Crisp, salty, and still somehow lightweight.Pan con tomate and patatas bravas - standout execution! A couple staple tapas dishes turned into something special.Sangria - why isn't this beverage more prevalent in the United States?By the time we left at 10:30pm, the line was out the door. Early dining rocks!",
