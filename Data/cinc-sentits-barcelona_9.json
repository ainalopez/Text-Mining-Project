    "Probably the best lunch ever - gastronomic tasting menu that took us 3 hours. \u00a0Besides the very good food, Laurena, our sommelier, made this meal a very special experience. \u00a0Her wine knowledge and willingness to experiment was wonderful. \u00a0White Tempranillo, smoked Cava, oh where to begin. \u00a0While not all dishes were my favorite (and hence my only reason not to give it 5 stars), I was super impressed by the oyster - love oysters, but this one was just outstanding. \u00a0Olive oil poached bonito paired with the smoked Cava was superb. Squab and a glass of red that was poured at the beginning of service and sitting and waiting 2 hours for the squab to arrive ;-), was wonderful.",
