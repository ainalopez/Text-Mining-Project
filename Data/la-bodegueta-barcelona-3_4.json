    "This was probably my favorite tapas bar in the city and was a great place to bring parents when they were in town and wanted to try a little bit of everything. \u00a0They have a wide variety of cheese plates, assorted meat plates, and other unique tapas. \u00a0This was where I fell in love with croquetas, and I haven't had a better one since. \u00a0They have the perfect texture and served hot.The outdoor seating is beautiful because it is situated on one of the prettier streets in the city and it is less crowded and bumbling that inside. \u00a0The inside is really crowded and you may have to wait awhile to be seated, which is made more difficult because there is ZERO standing space inside the restaurant. \u00a0I suggest going when its nice out and eating outdoors.",
