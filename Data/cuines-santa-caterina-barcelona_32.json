    "A local friend recommended this place and we were so happy to go on our last night in Barcelona as we had had a ton of tapas that were all excellent but similar. \u00a0We loved Cuines because they were asian fusion tapas, so we had sushi and spicy noodles along with some Spanish tapas. \u00a0The atmosphere is cool and feels very current and fresh. \u00a0They don't take reservations so we got there when they opened at 7:00pm and the queue filled the tables. \u00a0Our service was efficient and matter of fact.",
