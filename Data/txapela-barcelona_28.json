    "Holy slow service, batman! \u00a0Me and a buddy dropped in for a pre-dinner snack at 7pm while loitering on Passage de Garcia. \u00a0Restaurant had a handful of customers, but staff couldn't be bothered to serve us without getting flagged down.This place made a terrible bikini - little sandwiches of melted cheese and jamon iberico. \u00a0I mean, it's three ingredients! \u00a0How do you blow that?! \u00a0Bikinis are excellent when made right with good ingredients (see Tapac 24),but Txapela was truly regrettable.One of the quick tips said to try the \"Clara\" -- Bitburger beer + Fanta. \u00a0Do yourself a favor and stick with just the Bitburger; your taste buds will thank you later.I guess 1 star for being open and 1 star for not getting food poisoning?",
