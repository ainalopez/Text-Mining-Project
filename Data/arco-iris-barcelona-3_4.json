    "We were only in Barcelona a few days, visiting from the San Francisco Bay Area. \u00a0We are not vegetarians, but enjoy healthy food. \u00a0We discovered that if you love ham, pork and bacon, you'll love Catalonian food. \u00a0So, since we don't eat pig, we had a tough time finding even green salads that didn't have at least tuna - or foie gras (banned in California) - thrown on top. \u00a0 The pizzerias were the best hope we had of finding a dish without (too much) meat. \u00a0So here we were, sitting on a bench at the Sagrada Familia plaza in 95F heat, using our iPhone to find a vegetarian restaurant on Yelp - and we found Arco Iris just two blocks away. \u00a0The owner, Peter, was welcoming, knew just enough English to help us order (my Spanish/Catalan is practically nonexistent). \u00a0It was cool inside, beautiful, rustic, not too crowded, the service was friendly and quick, and best of all - everything we ordered was AMAZING!! \u00a0We ordered the talliarines al pesto, gaspatxo, crema de verdures, pizza arco iris - artesana. \u00a0And for postre, we ordered the sindria (watermelon). \u00a0 We would have been fine never eating again. \u00a0At least until the next day, anyway.",
