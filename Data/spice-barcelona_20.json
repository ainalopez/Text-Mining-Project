    "BEST CAFE. The food is to die for and you have to get the carrot cake if nothing else. They also make the best chai tea latte I've EVER had and my friend got a cappuccino and said it was amazing as well! We couldn't have been happier to find this place. The bagel sandwiches are also delicious, the Italian was my favorite but they are all fantastic! And while the carrot cake is a must(!!), the strawberry cheesecake is also amazing, as are the homemade Oreos! I've seriously just never been to a more perfect cafe with more perfect people. Lee, the owner, is amazing and so full of life and ready to share his love and knowledge of Barcelona and his cafe and other great places in the neighborhood! And Henry is super great too with the friendliest smile in town! When I come back to Barcelona you will find me here every day because there's literally no better way to start of your day than with amazing food and great people! And it's super affordable!! Worth more than every penny!",
