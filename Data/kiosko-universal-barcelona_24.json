    "Totally over rated. \u00a0I ordered the mixed seafood grill and the shrimp was not fresh ( meat is mushy and sticks to the shell). Saute mushroom was great with pesto sauce drizzle but the salt chunks was too much for me. \u00a0I guess you must have it with beer. \u00a0I grew up in an island country and the seafood served here is not fresh enough.",
