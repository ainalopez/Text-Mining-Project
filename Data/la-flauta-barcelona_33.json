    "One of my favourite restaurants anywhere. Almost everything on the menu is worth a try, but the foie gras, the mini filet steak, and the shrimp and squip skewers are exceptionally well done. Here you will also find some of the best patatas bravas in Barcelona. A must-try for any visitor to the city.",
