    "There is a category of five star and Michelin restaurants that are in a category of their own. \u00a0I can only pick a handful of restaurants that fit in this category, at this point in my life I can only pick four or five, and that I can call one of the best meals of my life. \u00a0Everything was perfect. \u00a0 French technique perfected. \u00a0 All the plates and flavors were very complex. \u00a0The staff was very accommodating and friendly. \u00a0I'd go to Barcelona just to eat here, seriously.",
