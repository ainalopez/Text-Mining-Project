    "Charming little cafe around the corner from Sagrada Familia. Not many tables inside or outside but that should tell you it's a small family run restaurant. We ordered salads, meats and cheese plates, beer and iced tea. Everything was delicious!Fantastic food although the service is a little slow. If you want fast service there is a McDonalds close by. If you want fresh, delicious food cooked and prepared by a family passionate about what they do, stop and stay a while.",
