    "Pretty fulfilling hot pot experience. Getting the all-you-can-eat hot pot gets you an entire trolley of food to start with. Definitely a portion of three or more. The soup base is great. If you want to add spicy to the soup, expect it to be really spicy. The quality of the food isn't top-notch but it's great for a few hungry friends looking for a nice dinner option. :)",
