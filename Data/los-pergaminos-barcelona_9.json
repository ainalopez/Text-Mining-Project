    "We kept hearing good things about the paella here. \u00a0Paella seems like a topic that inspires passionate debate among the Spanish, whether what you are eating is technically paella, or where are the acceptable places to eat paella. \u00a0I like the passion.The paella here was alright, but not my favorite. \u00a0I would have to say that the best paella that I've ever had is still stateside. \u00a0We ordered the mixed paella, which had chicken and seafood in it. \u00a0Given another chance, I would have ordered the seafood only paella (I was hoping the mix had sausage in it). \u00a0The dish was a little salty for my taste, but other than that, it had plenty of seafood in it.We also tried the honey eggplant dish. \u00a0Sticks of eggplant lightly fried and drizzled with honey. \u00a0The honey was was the real star of this dish, you could still taste the flowers in the honey, it had a complex flavor. \u00a0The eggplant itself was, again, too salty for my taste.",
