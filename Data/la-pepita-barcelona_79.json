    "my oh my.... this is an awesome place I stumbled upon walking around my hotel looking for dinner. place is a bit small but they do quick turnover. mainly because the foods are so delicious, people will devour them in 5 seconds! I had the mussels and croquette tapas then end it with beef pepita. steak melt in my mouth, thin crispy bread, yummy sauce and best mashed potato I have ever had. need I say more? service is top notch, everyone is so friendly! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",
