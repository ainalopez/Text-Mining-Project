    "After a couple of massively underwhelming 20 euro meals at various restaurants around town, this neighborhood joint seems like an absolute heaven sent. Their menu del dia is MASSIVE, so many choices (all available in English)! And everything (two plates of your choosing, dessert, drink) for just nine, that's right NINE euros! I am in love with their Catalan salad! And the people couldn't be nicer! I am thinking of getting up early tomorrow just so I can get in one more meal before my flight......mind you, even Camp Nou can't get me out of bed before 10am!",
