    "Inviting tiny pizzeria mid-way between Liceu and Jaume I on Carrer de Ferran in Bario Gotico. \u00a0Famished, we stumbled past early one evening on the way back from the beach. \u00a0A 1/8-slice of a sheet pan, call it 10cm x 15cm, goes for 4.65 euros (I think?). \u00a0We hit it twice for take-away; the second piece better than the first - jamon y champignones. \u00a0So. \u00a0Good. \u00a0Seating is limited. \u00a0Service is functional, if not friendly.",
