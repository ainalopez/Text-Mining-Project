    "My wife and I went here two nights during our honeymoon trip to Barcelona, and we absolutely loved it.We live in California, so we have our fair share of Mexican food, but La Taqueria is one of the best we've ever had! \u00a0 The guacamole was delicious, salsa selection was superb, and the tacos were amazing. \u00a0My personal favorite was the beef taco, which was extremely well seasoned and cooked to perfection.The restaurant is very close to the Sagrada Famelia, so it's definitely a must see when you're in Barcelona. \u00a0We miss it already!",
