    "We had an enjoyable meal here on a Saturday night. \u00a0The place was jam-packed and very busy, but we were lucky enough to get a table. \u00a0When the hostess led us to our table, it took me a minute to realized we were being led to a tiny little balcony level around the perimeter of the room. \u00a0Barely high enough for my husband to stand up straight, and it shook whenever anyone walked. \u00a0But it offered a great view of the piano player and the diners below. \u00a0The place is dated from a decor sense, but still oozes with character in a kitschy kind of way.Our meal was great. \u00a0My husband had a baked fish, and an appetizer (I forget what). \u00a0I had a ravioli dish and the onion soup. \u00a0We both had dessert. \u00a0Everything was delicious. \u00a0The service was a bit touch-and-go, but it was good for a laugh. \u00a0For instance - when we asked for olive oil, and he absentmindedly brought us the 1/2-drank bottle of wine from a nearby table - much to the diners' chagrin! \u00a0We laughed as he corrected his mistake.An enjoyable meal!",
