    "Barcelona is not a city known for brunch that is much more common in the states. Most mornings on my travels I had a light breakfast of a pastry and coffee, which made Brunch & Cakes more traditional while still \u00a0having an eclectic element you would expect out of Barcelona dining a very pleasant surprise.This place is small and also very popular so you can expect to wait for a table during peek hours. The decor of Brunch & Cake reminded me of a 20-something year old's hipster kitchen, the look totally works and is cute. The food was the real highlight though, here is what I tried:Cappuccino - A beautifully presented and delicious tasting coffeeFresh OJ - Fairly common in Spain but I'm not used to this great tasting freshly squeezed OJCheddar Bacon Waffles (Nuestro Gofre con Cebolla Caramelizada) - Liege Waffle topped with what looks to be a half pound of perfectly crisp bacon, sweet corn, caramelized onions, and a truffled syrup.",
