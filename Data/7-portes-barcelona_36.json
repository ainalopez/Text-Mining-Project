    "We showed up for lunch at about 2:30 on a Monday without a reservation and there was a fifteen minute wait. A table was produced at the appointed time. Our waiter provided olives while we ordered. My wife began with the monkfish soup, which the outdoor host had recommended. It was quite similar to a French soupe de poisson, down to the rouille and toasts, but had chunks of the fish. Quite nice. I plumped for the house anchovies, a generous portion that exceeded the mopping up capabilities of the pa amb y tomaquet that accompanied it. Fortunately, some rolls filled in.We moved onto a savory paella, which did lack the crust on the bottom I associate with a great one. And then a zarzuela with lobster and langoustine. The shrimp were good but the pricier items were a bit overdone. Next time I would order something else.We drank the house sangria. It worked.Service was excellent and the ambiance of the room is lux.As near as I can judge, about half of the crowd were tourists. The people next to us were clearly speaking Catalan.",
