    "Our first dining experience in Barcelona and very much a winner. \u00a0The menu contains an impressive list of different mussel dishes served in large enameled pots. \u00a0We started with a tasty plate of tiny fried octopus and a bottle of sidra which were also delicious. \u00a0We finished with a very respectable tiramisu that had the two of us vying for the very last spoonful.Service was attentive and prompt. \u00a0This place is an excellent choice for fresh local seafood when you're ambling about L'Eixample.",
