    "RESTAURANT GRESCA (Lunch, Monday) was, in a word, superb! Got to sit next to Al\u00e8lia Artal from Cinq Sentis, and had a good chance to speak with her about Spanish cuisine, but the meal here at Gresca was innovative, exciting, delicious, and -- truly -- perfect. This was outstanding, and is definitely be on our list of places to return to! \u00a0Chef Rafa Pe\u00f1a is a genius, and each bite was at once simple and pure, yet layered with complex flavors and completely satisfying . . . hands down, the best lunch I had in Spain!",
