    "The heaven of gourmet tapas for 1,40(small) and 1,90(big) Euro?! Excuse me? Last night I did my 73463798579 visit to this amazing place with my friend. We craved for small appetizer in the middle of the night and ''Lizarran is always a good idea'' we said to each other. \u00a0To my surprise, each tapas was 1 Euro. Was it cheaper because it was almost closing hour? Don't ask me, I only eat. From Majorca Sausage With Cremette Cheese, Salad and Tuna Stuffed Red Pepper to \u00a0Iberian Ham with Quail Egg, yummy yummy yummy yummy.The Lizarran experience works differently from other tapas bars and very straight forward1. Get up and take a plate from the bar. 2. Pick as much as you like from the wide range of COLD tapas. You can order your drink from the bar or the waiter will come and take the order. Whatever it suits you.3. Go back to your seat and eat. (Oh yeah there will be a big party in your mouth)4. Keep the skewers!!! This way they know how much to charge you. For HOT tapas, watch the kitchen door. The waiter frequently comes out with a big tray of tapas to serve on the tables. I've been asked \u00a0a lot of time by my friends if these tapas are free. unfortunately, they are not! Only freshly made but come on, the price is always great for this quality of the tapas. Isn't it?",
