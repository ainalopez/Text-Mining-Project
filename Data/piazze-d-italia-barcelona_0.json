    "This was my favorite Italian meal in Barcelona!Decor was simple and casual and the pasta was perfectly al dente. We went here twice during our short stay and loved it more than Margherita Puzzeria even though it was further to get to and wasnt as trendy!The prices are very fair 9,5euro for pizza and pasta!",
