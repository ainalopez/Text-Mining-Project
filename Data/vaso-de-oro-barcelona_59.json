    "This is an authentic locals bar in Barceloneta, close to the Metro station. The bar is long and incredibly narrow - so be prepared to squeeze past other customers to get a seat. (Everyone else does). As well as the relative scarcity of tourists (perhaps not now it's on Qype...), they do authentic, filling Catalan tapas and serve their own beer: that's right, this is a brew-pub, (or should that be 'brew-bar'?) and they do a lovely 7% amber coloured lager, Vaso de Oro Rubia (just ask for 'rubia'). The staff were friendly and efficient, as you'd expect, and the prices are a joy compared with some of the inflated tourist haunts around. Recommended.",
