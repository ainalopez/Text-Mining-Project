    "GO HERE!Personally my favourite bar/tapas hangout in Barcelona. Food is cheap and super good. Wine is decent price as well. Can often have to wait for a table though at peak times but the servers are helpful and will serve you as quick as possible. Croquettes are amazing, deep fried artichokes as well. Steak tartare is great. Pretty much everything on the menu is good.I think I eat here almost every day when in town. I normally have to fit in a second lunch or dinner but it is worth it.",
