    "The first time my husband and I tried to swing by there was a line out the door. I make it a general rule not to wait on such lines. This happened to be on a Thursday (actually, it was on Thanksgiving). It was early though - like maybe around 6 or 7pm, pre-dinner. We decided to continue back through the Gothic quarter to see another cathedral, then head to dinner, going back to Granja Viader after for dessert. It was the right decision. NO line. Even better - there were tables available. So maybe it was about 8 -830pm and they close at 9pm. The upside: places like this with crowds in and out all day churn out the chocolate and churros all day long. So you know what you're getting is FRESH! And while these were definitely fresh items, they weren't the best we'd had on our trip. We enjoyed them, yes, but we had some seriously delectable hot chocolate in Madrid. Not to mention La Ventana in the Gothic Quarter. Oh my.The downside: this place isn't far from La Rambla, one of the largest tourist spots in Barcelona. So, you'll get loads of tourists here. The goal is to time your visit right - so you're not waiting on aforementioned LONG lines.Sigh, I love Spain - a true chocoholic's delight!",
