    "My sister and I had been wanting to come here since before it had officially opened! We are huge fans of the Dos Santos brothers and were excited for this! We finally got around to going to Barcelona and trying it out! I was not disappointed at all! Our waitress was super helpful and friendly. We had the chips and salsa, the chilaquiles, horchata, and tres leches cake! All of it was delicious! There salsa is really good, and it was the best Mexican food i've tried in Spain for sure!",
