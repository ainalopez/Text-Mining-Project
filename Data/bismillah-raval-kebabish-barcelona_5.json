    "Beef kebab is ok, not the best in Barcelona and definitely not in Europe.Price is reasonable, I think its \u20ac3.50 to \u20ac4.Restaurant is always packed & kind of look not good because it is kind of dark.When I was there many people eating tika & curry, so I will try that next time.Update: chicken tika, rice & salad costs \u20ac4.50, and the portion is quite gracious.You will get 1 portion of rice, with 5-6 medium chicken fillet & with small mix salad (the one you get for kebab). Good value.",
