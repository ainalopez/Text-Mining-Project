    "Contrary to some of the reviews here, I actually had a fantastic experience at Pitarra! Me and 4 other people came here after reading about it on a Professor Paella's blog and so we rolled in around 10:30pm after Barcelona had just lost against Madrid, which is why I think the restaurant was relatively empty. Immediately, you noticed the elegant decor, and although we were sporting our casual clothes and Barca jerseys, the owner and waiters were very friendly! We ordered a salad, a charcuterie plate, 2 paellas, and sangria (this was more like a late night snack :] ) Sangria was excellent! Salad was fresh! The cut meats were good and the paella was delicious! I would say that you can share 1 paella between 2-3 people. It was very flavorful and had the right balance between amount of rice and protein. I later asked the owner about being able to accommodate large groups and he was very friendly and showed me the potential menus and the large group rooms. Definitely recommended!",
