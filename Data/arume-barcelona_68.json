    "This place was a fantastic experience! We of course got the blackberry mojito as well as a margarita. The mojito was perfection! The margarita was VERY strong! For starters we got the scallops in a foam sauce with something crispy on top. It was very good but small for the price (only two scallops). We ordered the lamb dish as well as seafood paella for our two main meals. The lamb was amazing!! The red onion on top of the lamb was a great touch. The seafood paella could have truthfully been better but still good. I would definitely get the duck paella next time. For desert we got la Torrija de Manuel and it was soooooooo good! Like flan/bread pudding/creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e all rolled into one. The service was fantastic and attentive too... Felt like I was back in the states. I would love to go back!",
