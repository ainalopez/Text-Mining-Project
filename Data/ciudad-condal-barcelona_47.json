    "If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. Recommended to me by a friend, my girlfriend and I decided to stop by for our last dinner before leaving Barcelona. It was pretty busy at around 6-7pm; the wait-time for a seat inside the restaurant was up to about 45 minutes. Luckily, my girlfriend made friends with one of the workers. He told us to wait by a couple who was almost done with their dinner by the bar, which operates as first come, first served. (Even though it seems uncomfortable hovering behind a couple like the seat-vultures you're aspiring to be, at a place like this, you really need to keep the goal of getting seats in mind.) [Kuya] Daniel hooked us up big time. He gave us dishes he thought were delicious (and they were) because my girlfriend and I had no idea what to order. Unfortunately, the seafood paella kept running out, so we weren't able to order that. The foie gras and whatever Daniel gave us was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I can't even begin to describe the magic that was happening inside my mouth. I still have dreams about it. The entire tapas experience at the bar, along with making friends with the staff members and other guests sitting around us, was definitely a memorable one. Oh! Would highly recommend getting their sangrias. LIFE CHANGING.",
