    "Extensive wine selection at premium prices. Hard to pin down the vibe, but a mix of international hipsters bordering on modern yuppies seeking a scene to be seen. Hard to figure out who to flag to get a table or bar stool, and service went from hot to cold but mostly cool, distant, and abrupt. Only had drinks, so can't comment on the food.",
