    "It will be pretty hard to have seafood much fresher than this! If you're visiting La Sagrada Familia and need a place for a meal, I highly recommend La Paradeta.As explained in other reviews, the process can be a bit confusing the first time, but it ends up being very straightforward and fun - all prices are listed per kg and you get to choose from as many types of fish, crabs, lobsters, squids etc. as there are available (usually a very broad selection). Pick how you want it to have it prepared, any choices of drinks and receive your order number. As soon as it's ready, they'll call out your number, you pick up your dishes and enjoy!The mini octopus and the navajas (a long type of shellfish) were particularly tasty, and prices are very reasonable. It's by no means fancy or revolutionary, but ticks most of the boxes for a nice seafood restaurant - fresh ingredients, correct preparation and fair price!",
