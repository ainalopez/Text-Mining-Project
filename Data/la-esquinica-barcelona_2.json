    "Be sure to make a reservation in advance (we did thank god) because the queue is long and there is one every night of the week. This restaurant has a monopoly on the neighborhood and does not seem touristy as most patrons are locals. Be prepared to order quick as the waiters are very fast paced. Food comes quick too. We ordered at least 7-8 tapas and a bottle of the house red and our order was under \u20ac50. Such a great deal for such great food. The patatas bravas were incredible - best we've had in Barcelona. The blood sausage with onions was also an all around favorite. Over all great tapas restaurant and possibly the best one we've been to during out stay...actually it was hands down the best!",
