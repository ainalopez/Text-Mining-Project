    "Nice, cool interior with lots of white space and some photographs (no surprises: one of a tangoing couple, one of cows on the pampa). Wooden, simple furniture and a salad bar. The menu is of course primarily beef oriented, and there are are some interesting combin menus - unfortunately only at luch time. My steak was excellent and so were the artistically placed and handmade French fries. The chimcurri sauce was home made. Service was good. Only minus: the wine by the glass is not on the wine list and turned out to be rather pricey.",
