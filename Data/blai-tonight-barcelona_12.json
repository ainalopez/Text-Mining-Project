    "We weren't exactly at Blai Tonight but next door to the newly opened Tonight 2 owned by the same people serving the same Pintchos.Every piece is only 1 Euro with a choice of more than 30 different tapas (with new varieties coming in constantly). Find a seat, mix with the locals, have a beer and eat! We ended up eating 32 pintchos shared between 2 within shortest time - soooo good!",
