    "Easily one of the best restaurants I've tried in Spain. I was starting to get a bit tired of tapas so we looked around for something different and found Can Culleretes and its Catalonian cuisine. We made sure to arrive within minutes of opening (9pm) and got prime seats in the middle of the floor. We really liked the atmosphere of the clientele and the design of the interior. We ordered the steamed mussels and clams as appetizer and it was excellent! The meat of the shellfish was SO tender and there was none of that gritty sand you may find in (lesser) seafood restaurants. I had to hold myself back from eating all of it so that I would have room for my entree.. and that my boyfriend would be able to eat some :) We also shared a small bowl of veal stew with wild mushrooms which was good and comforting. For our entrees, we ordered the suckling pig and the lamb. I don't remember what the lamb was called and there were multiple lamb dishes, but I do remember that we got the priciest one. And they were both INCREDIBLE. The meats were extremely tender and barely needed the push of the knife. The dishes really brought out the two meats' different textures and flavors, and we savored each bite. The lamb came with a mixture of potatoes and tomatoes, and the pork with pine nuts and different types of olives/peppers. And of course, we had a red wine that was recommended from our server. It was good, but I think it was a bit forgotten due to the food. I'm so glad we had a chance to try Catalonian cuisine -- I want some more!!",
