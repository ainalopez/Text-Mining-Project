    "So this is REAL authentic Japanese cuisine in this neighborhood for sure.Very delicate sushi ( which made by Japanese sushi chef from Japan. ) and super yummy handmade Japanese tapas....and those dishes are also cooked by Japanese chef.I really recommend that you would sit at bar, and talk to chefs about what you like and what he recommends for the day. They use local fishes and they are really fresh. He'll be able to fix your Omakase dishes! His name is Daisuke who is the owner of the restaurant, and daisuke is really friendly and professional about sushi, he speaks good English also! )",
