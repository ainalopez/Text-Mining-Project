    "This place is a hidden gem. \u00a0I haven't been to many coffees shops in Barcelona, as I was only there for a week and upon Yelping what places to go to brunch in the area, this was one of the first that popped up. \u00a0It is filled with locals and not a tourist trap. \u00a0A boho/ hipster theme, it was a perfect way to enjoy a cappuccino and some casual tapas for brunch. \u00a0I started off with some warm muesli, then we had some hummus with spiced chips, followed by some cheese and almond tapas. \u00a0We then went ahead and ordered a cheesecake and delicious orange wine cake for dessert. \u00a0Definitely take the time to come here, it is not overly packed, it is quiet, and just a quaint and pleasant atmosphere!",
