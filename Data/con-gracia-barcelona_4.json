    "This is a place for tourists. As helpful as trip advisor and yelp prove to be, one of the shortcomings of using it abroad is that all tourists will generally flock to highly rated restaurants. Unfortunately, the restaurant is usually highly rated because another fellow tourist deems it to be so.Thus, you essentially get what I got upon walking into Con Gracia. A place where all of the patrons are speaking English. You will be naught to find a large local presence here. The food? Good, adequate - but if given more time, I wouldn't return.",
