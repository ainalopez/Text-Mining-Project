    "We went to Mayura for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance. \u00a0The seating is cozy and we got a seat right next to the window.Service:SUCKS!!! I mean it took the waitress 5-10 minutes to even bring out the menu and offer us something to drink. \u00a0When we ordered an additional item, it took them 20 minutes to bring it out (we were already done with lunch by that time).Food:The only option to order was the 'Thali'. \u00a0We ordered the Vegetarian Thali which came with 3 things (Channa Masala, Subzi Mixed, and Palak Paneer). \u00a0The food was decent, but the bread was cold. \u00a0We were very hungry, so we didnt think much about the quality. \u00a0But we definitely ate better Indian food at Rajah (near Las Ramblas).",
