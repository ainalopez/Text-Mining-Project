    "Love this place. \u00a0It is right next to Palau de Musica. \u00a0In Barcelona for six days and have eaten here three times. \u00a0 Small plates about 5 to 8 euros each. \u00a0 Had houmus with little toast, great salad with good mixed lettuce and walnuts, \u00a0pork loin, \u00a0sirloin, chicken skewers, \u00a0calamari, \u00a0danish meatballs, \u00a0empanadas, etc. \u00a0Great bar menu including mojitos and sangria made with cava aka champagne. Great service as well. \u00a0 Get there early because many people like this place too.",
