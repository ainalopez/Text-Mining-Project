    "We had heard this place could get crowded, so we went around 6:30 pm to beat the dinner crowd. We were seated right away. We had heard good things about their paella, so we ordered the rich man's paella and a mixed seafood platter. The paella didn't have as much seafood as we were expecting, \u00a0quite a bit less actually. The seafood platter had monkfish, lobster, etc. but the flavors weren't there and relied on us using the tartar sauce on the side for flavor. The dishes were a bit pricey in my opinion, and we didn't even order their wine. The place itself, however, is quite nice, relaxing (but then again, we weren't there at the busiest hour), and the service was decent.",
