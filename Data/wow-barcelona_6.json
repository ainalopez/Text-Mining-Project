    "First of all the service here was the best we have had in Spain so far - the waitress was incredibly responsive. \u00a0My husband and I enjoyed ours salads, though mine was overdressed. But as another reviewer pointed out it was nice to have some vegetables! \u00a0The breaded chicken we got for our four year old was excellent and the adults ended up stealing some. And yes, there is outdoor seating.",
