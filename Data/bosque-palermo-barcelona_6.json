    "This place is a MUST when here in Barcelona. This was the best meal I've had during my whole trip to Spain! Sangria + grilled seafood,+paella= food orgasm.It's a Monday night, and this place was still crowded and we had to sit outside. \u00a0The sangria was probably the best I had here in my stay in Barcelona. It had the perfect blend of sweetness and spirits, just a wonderful mix with a slight kick to it.The grilled seafood platter is every seafood lovers dream. They were grilled to perfection and definitely not dry. And you can't complain about the price with it being about \u20ac16-18.A good sample platter of the Mediterranean sea!The paella was loaded with mixed seafood and was so fresh and delicious. The rice was fully seasoned and cooked just right. Warning: it does take a long time to come out since its made to order.This place is a must-go for anyone visiting here in Barcelona",
