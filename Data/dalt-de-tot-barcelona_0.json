    "Very nice place in Sant Gervasi if you want to have some tapas. The place is nice and is located in a very quite and residential neighborhood. The food is just amazing. My faves: the \"bomba\", mushrooms with garlic and the chicken fingers. Oooh and if you are up for desert don't even look at the menu and have the cheesecake!!!",
