    "Best sangria I've ever had in life. Ordered a pitcher. As for food I ordered the breaded chicken. If you're American and like chicken parmesan, this is the dish for you. It was great. My friend ordered the ribeye--medium. We split our meals so that we could try both. The steak was honestly ooookay but good for here I guess? In Texas, it wouldn't have cut it. Our waiter was hilarious and hooked us up on the dessert with extra chocolate and Carmel on top of our lemon pie and dolce leches (something from France apparently?) which was wonderful! If I could, I would've ordered that dessert instead if mine. Very small and intimate. There was a long wait but we were seated within 3 minutes of arrival. If you're ugly, bring someone pretty. -A",
