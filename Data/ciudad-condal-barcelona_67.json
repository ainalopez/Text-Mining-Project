    "We went there early at 5pm on a Sunday so there was ample seating. \u00a0We were called over by the owner to sit at the bar where one can see all the different tapas that can be ordered. \u00a0Service was excellent. The owner and staff was very friendly. \u00a0 The food were fresh. The shrimp skewers were cooked perfectly. \u00a0Definitely the best tapas I have ever had so far. \u00a0If you are in Barcelona this is a must east restaurant especially for tapas.",
