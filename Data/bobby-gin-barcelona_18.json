    "This place specializes in gin and tonics, yet I went to several other places in Barcelona that did it better. The bartender didn't even pour a full shot into our (overpriced) drinks. If I'm paying 10+ euros for a G&T, I would at least like to be able to taste the gin. He seemed to play favorites, giving generous pours to his friends, while stiffing strangers like us. Unless you're already pals with the waitstaff, you can do better than this place.",
