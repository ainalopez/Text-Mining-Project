    "Being a local in this city, I must say this is a pretty place to dine at for its decor, ambience....Definitely a tourist hot spot, nice to look at, but that's about it. Not a place for foodies. I wouldn't come for the food nor the service. Portions are small (jam\u00f3n full portion was 22\u20ac for paper thin and scarce slices). Rest of the dishes looked good but quite meh.",
