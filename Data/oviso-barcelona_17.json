    "We had a nice brunch at this place! The meals were good and the prices very attractive. Waitresses and waiters were polite, smiling, and competent. Eating outside was enjoyable because we received sunlight. It is satisfactory to see vegan and vegetarian food in the menu. The cappuccino I had was fairly good.",
