    "Casa Guinart is a great little tapas bar; located directly behind the Mercado de La Boqueria. My husband, sister, and I arrived around 4:30 pm and immediately found three stools at the bar. The bar overlooks the open kitchen area so you can watch the chefs prepare your food. We ordered several glasses of red wine as well as the marinated olives, jamon iberico (cured ham from an acorn fed, black hoofed Iberian pig), and fried padron peppers. Everything was so delicious! The tapas were all made to order and contained high quality ingredients. I would have ordered more from the menu, but we had dinner plans at 7 pm and I didn't want to spoil my appetite. We finished our meal with espressos and a plate of assorted cookies and truffles. Would definitely add this spot if you are looking for great tapas in Barcelona!",
