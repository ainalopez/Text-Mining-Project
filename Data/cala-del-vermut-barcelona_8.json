    "After visiting Cala del Vermut on my last visit to Barcelona this was on the top of my list of restaurants for my recent trip. \u00a0It was so good I went three separate times on this visit. \u00a0The food is amazing as are the drinks. \u00a0I recommend the house made Vermut. \u00a0If you are interested in sangria be prepared for a large glass with a kick. \u00a0The restaurant does not have a menu so be prepared to point to the food and be prepared for an amazing experience.",
