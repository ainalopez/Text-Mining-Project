    "Nice atmosphere, nice staff, interesting menu. However, our food was very uneven. We ordered a tapas sampler and two identical paella platters for our group, but the food quality varied widely. One of the identical paellas was extremely salty, and the other not. With more attention to consistent food quality, this place would be great.",
