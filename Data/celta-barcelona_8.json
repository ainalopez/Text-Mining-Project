    "Very nice octopus/ squids specialty casual restaurant recommended by locals. Order the signature dish- Pulpo (octopus tentacles). We tried the a la plancha (grilled version). It was fresh, tender slices of octopus pieces cut from an entire big octopus, tossed with Olive oil. We also order fried baby octopus (pulpitos) which was equally nice. Highly recommended",
