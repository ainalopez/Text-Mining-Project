    "What a treat! The meal was incredible and the service great. Well worth seeking out if you are visiting Segrada Familia. \u00a0Starters of zucchini velout\u00e9 with arugula and a duck and shiitake pasta. \u00a0Both fantastic. Duck confit with roasted pear entree was wonderful and the lightly seared tuna entree was perfectly rare. With dessert or coffee it was a perfect meal with a great bottle of wine and a couple beers for under \u20ac50. They had 3 selections for each course. Dog friendly (made us wish our pooch stowed away). Great little hidden-away place that I hesitate to share because it's so perfect.",
