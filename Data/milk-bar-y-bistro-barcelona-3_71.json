    "This place is amazingly good! It's a little out of the way and down a side street but worth it for the food and drinks. It was packed when we walked in. But the bloody mary is the best I've ever had and the asian chicken salad was just as good. The staff was really friendly and most spoke perfect english. I really don't like eggs or salmon but tried some of my friend's salmon benedict and it was surprisingly good. The banana split was quite a treat too and is not a typical banana-ice-cream-and-chocolate dish. I've been here for 3 weeks so far and this is the best food I've had in Barcelona. I will definitely go back soon!",
