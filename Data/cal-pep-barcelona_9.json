    "Food is good but there are better places in Barcelona (Tapeo, Quimet & Quimet, El Xampanyet, etc.) \u00a0- especially considering the wait (of mostly tourists), this place is a bit overrated and a bit overpriced. \u00a0 Things we ordered:1) razor clams (good, 9 euro for 5)2) grilled monkfish (also good, smallish fish for 17 euro, came with amazing potatoes and half a grilled tomato)3) squid and chickpeas - 13 euro. \u00a0Ask for a half portion if they will let you (if you're only 2 people because it gets mundane after a while) - it's pretty good but was way oversalted. \u00a0Wouldn't order this again.When I asked about the gambas they said 4 would cost 30 euro. \u00a0Wtf? \u00a0As I mentioned, overpriced. \u00a0Food is good though.",
