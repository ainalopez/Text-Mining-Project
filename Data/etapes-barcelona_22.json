    "Excellent. We were there for the lunch menu, which featured a succulent osso buco and a very tasty bonito (tuna) dish. Even the pan entomatau, which you can get anywhere, was particularly good. We took a table outside and found it very pleasant. It is extremely affordable and definitely worth going back for.",
