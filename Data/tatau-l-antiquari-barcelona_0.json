    "Was getting dropped off at Sant with a friend and needed some decent food nearby. Stumbled across this place on Yelp by accident and am so glad I did because the food is great. We had just come from Madrid, where we ended up eating at a bunch of hipster cafes. This place was similar to them in the decor, but in a much more authentic way. The menu changes daily, the proprietor (a woman) is nice and attentive without being overbearing and she helped translate the few words we didn't know to English.The food is simple, and mostly meat. There are a few salads, but I don't think I'd get them knowing what else they offer. I got a botifarra sausage with sweet apples plate (12 euro) that was spiced with \"arabic\" spices. So amazing, honestly. I can't wait to bring my parents here. My friend got a pork loin in a date sauce (13 euro), which was great with the bread that she provided to mop it all up (a basket of 4 slices cost .40 euro, plus a bottle of water at .80). The bread was the only thing that wasn't great about this place, but it did the trick. It's my first day in Barcelona but I have a feeling this place is going to be one of the best parts.",
