    "Burger is adequate and large but WOW never coming here again. Waited 39 minutes for a takeout burger with \"patatas aioli\". Wasn't busy, \u00a03pm on a Monday. Want to see what \u20ac3.40 of patatas alioli looks like here? Four steamed new potatoes. Yes, \u00a0four tiny steamed new potatoes. (See photo.) \u00a0What the what?! Never again. Disgusting.Incidentally, I also ordered \u20ac0.80 mayo on my burger and was charged \u20ac1.40 for alioli instead. This despite having a menu system where you check boxes for what you want on a form, so no excuses. Rip-off.",
