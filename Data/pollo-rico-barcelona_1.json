    "I had high hopes for this place, especially after I read a few good reviews, especially on their chicken. It's pretty much a restaurant where you eat at the bar. Ordered a breaded chicken dish, even though I should've ordered some rotisserie. Honestly, this tasted like chicken that comes out of a Tyson-make that Great Value-bag. My half got a breaded beef filet dish that had no flavor at all. Patatas bravas were just ok, considering there are other good places in Barcelona that serve these....plenty of places. Gave two stars only for the service.....our server was friendly and attentive. Can't say much about anything else.",
