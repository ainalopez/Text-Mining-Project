    "Very solid food. \u00a0Probably closer to 3.5. \u00a0This was the first restaurant we ate at when arrived as we had rented an apartment and it was not ready yet. \u00a0After 10 days here I finally can say we can review it and comfortably say it was very good food mainly visited by locals. \u00a0We sat outside and had the snails and some other tapas. \u00a0I'm not craving to go back, but if in the area it is an excellent choice.",
