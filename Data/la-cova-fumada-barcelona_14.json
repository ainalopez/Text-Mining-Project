    "Thanks to Yelpers for discovering this place. I went there for a late lunch and was not disappointed. Their food rocks!!I was by myself so just had to wait 10mins before finding a spot to stand at the counter. If you are several people, there is definitely a wait for sitting at a table as the place is pretty small (seats maybe 24). \u00a0It's worth waiting though!I ordered 2 bombas, a grilled squid, artichokes and had a cold beer and it was simply delicious.Highly recommend eating here.",
