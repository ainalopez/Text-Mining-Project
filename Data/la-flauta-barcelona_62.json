    "Day 5 dinner, our group of 8 went to La Flauta. \u00a0We arrived early (7:45PM) and saw that the sidewalk tables were full and the lower floor was full. \u00a0They were just beginning to seat the upstairs portion of the restaurant.We had the asparagus with mushrooms (5.30 Euros), Huevos Cabreados \u00a0(5.80), artichokes (5.75), clams (11.45), bread with tomato (2.50), Foie gras (3.90), shrimp (3.70) and beef brochettes (3.90).Also had a bottle of El Perro Verde. \u00a0A bottle of water is 1.75 euros.Every tapas dish was very good with the huevos, artichokes, and beef better than the rest with the foie simply superb (cooked to perfection with a sweet fruit accompaniment created a magnificent taste experience).Service was friendly and prompt.From a timing perspective, probably our shortest evening dining experience as we were done and out of the restaurant by 9:45PM. \u00a0At that time, the line waiting for a table was almost out the door (there is a 50 foot bar from the door to the register).Only negative experience is that change from dinner was shortchanged by 1 euro and (reviewing the receipt today) noticed that they had charged for too many shrimp tapas. \u00a0So, I give the food 5/5 with deducts for short change and incorrect bill.",
