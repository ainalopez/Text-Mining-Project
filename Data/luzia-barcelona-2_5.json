    "We went to this restaurant the first night of our visit to Barcelona. \u00a0The food was okay, but the server was a somewhat confrontational to a gentleman in our party. \u00a0That first night, I went upstairs to go to the bathroom and noticed that the atmosphere up there was quite nice, so I made a mental note to return on another night to have dinner upstairs. \u00a0Several nights later, I returned with three other people and we headed upstairs to try and get a table. \u00a0To the best of our knowledge, this was a self-seating restaurant. When we got to the top of the stairs, we were approached by an incredibly rude and irritable waitress who proceeded to scold us for having the audacity to come upstairs to ask for a table. \u00a0She barked at us to go downstairs and request to be seated by the hostess. \u00a0In fact her words (with \u00a0a head bob and finger point) were as followed: \u00a0\"Uh...normally when you enter a restaurant...you smile nicely and ask to be seated...\" \u00a0She then turned abruptly and stormed away. \u00a0We stood there absolutely stunned, our jaws dropped at how unnecessarily rude this waitress was. \u00a0We then watched as she bent over the wall to yell something down to another employee on the first floor. \u00a0We then walked downstairs and attempted to talk to the manager (who I think was the one that she yelled down to), she just smiled and talked over us, only repeating \"its okay, its okay\". \u00a0She did not listen to a word of what we were saying. \u00a0We finally gave up and just left the restaurant. \u00a0We went across the street to The Attic restaurant where we were immediately welcomed with a big smile by the hostess at the front door. \u00a0Our company trip to Barcelona included about 70 people, all staying across the street at Le Meridian Hotel. \u00a0Needless to say, we spread the word about the treatment we received at Luzia Restarant and advised all to beware of the rude service. \u00a0All I can say is BAD BUSINESS.",
