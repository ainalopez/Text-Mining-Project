    "I stumbled upon this place while walking through Barcelona. They had several seating areas inside, apart from each other so you can find your private spot. We've tried their cold soup, nothing fancy, I wouldn't do it again. But other things, traditional Spanish dishes, were good, so it was a good spot to take a break, refuel and continue our journey.",
