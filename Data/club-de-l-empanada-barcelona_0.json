    "We bumped into this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant after leaving a nearby restaurant where we had a bad experience so we were still hungry. \u00a0Club de l'empanada was just what we needed. \u00a0It is run by two brothers who clearly have fun with their job. Blues music was playing on the stereo - I didn't recognize any songs but it created a fun mood. \u00a0I only saw 3 tables and some stools. \u00a0One table had 5 people laughing and enjoying themselves. I had a good tap beer. I don't remember what kind but there is only one. \u00a0We had empanadas and an omelet which I consider to be more like a quiche. Both were very good. We also got chorizo which was a mistake but I have to blame us not them because it's just chorizo. The whole amount cost just \u20ac10.80. The good mood from the owners and the music was contagious and we left feeling great!",
