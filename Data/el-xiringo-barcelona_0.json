    "The Yelp reviews sent us here- we weren't disappointed. Our server Jul\u00ed was very helpful and made delicious recommendations. We got cuttlefish croquettes, mussels in cava sauce, pescaditos fritos and fried artichokes plus a delicious bottle of sauvignon blanc- all for under 50 euros. They close at 5p for the turnover to dinner, so we ate quickly but didn't feel rushed at all. We'll be back!",
