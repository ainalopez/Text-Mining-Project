    "I agree with Samuel C.'s review below. \u00a0It was awesome. We ate here on 3 different occasions over 4 days....Twice for dinner and once for breakfast. \u00a0I appreciated that they had gluten free items clearly indicated; they also had gluten free bread available and it was delicious! My fianc\u00e9 LOVED the beer. \u00a0The service was decent, but they were slammed both times we were there for dinner. \u00a0I would get there around 8 if you want a table and decent service...any later and you may be waiting awhile for a server to come take your order. The building is amazing. \u00a0The menu is extensive. The drinks great.",
