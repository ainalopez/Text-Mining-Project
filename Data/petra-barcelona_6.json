    "Petra was, BY FAR, the best meal I had in Barcelona. I shouldn't have waited a week to write this review, because now I don't remember all the dishes we tried, but I could never forget that tuna dish. So, so amazing. We also had a gazpacho/avocado situation that was pretty wonderful. The most shocking thing about this restaurant is that it is SO affordable!! Should I ever come back to Barcelona, Petra will be my first meal!",
