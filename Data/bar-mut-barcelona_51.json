    "We would have never found Bar Mut without the fantastic concierge staff at the Mandarin Oriental. Thanks to them, not only did we have one of our best meals in Spain, but also a truly unforgettable night. As far as I could tell, we were definitely the only Americanas in the house full of locals, old and young. As soon as we walked in, we were treated VERY well, with handsome and charming servers giving us their undivided attention. Although we were a bit dressed up, we were still very comfortable at this super casual, but very nice restaurant. Some menu items not to miss:* Erizo del Mar - If you love sea urchin, this is a great dish for you. Mixed with diced green apples and served in the shell, you can have a playful photo sesh after you're done. *see profile pic.* Erizo del Mar over rice - This truly might be one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. The color of the urchin is so vibrant, and the flavor so full, combined with the creaminess of the rice, it's ruined me for any uni I can get in the States. * Razor Clams - Simply amazing. * Grilled Octopus with Potatoes - Second best thing I've put in my mouth. * Foie a la Planxa topped Steak. I will never say no to Foie a la planxa, but at this point, we were so full, I could barely put another morsel in my tummy. Definitely not to be missed though! If you're lucky enough to be invited to the Club Mutis, just around the corner from the restaurant, GO. And be ready for some delicious cocktailing fun.",
