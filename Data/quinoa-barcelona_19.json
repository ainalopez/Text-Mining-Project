    "Good food ,bad service. \u00a0Stuff is slow and kind of rude. \u00a0Thats why the place is not getting more stars. \u00a0 \u00a0Also prices are not E. \u00a0Should be EE. \u00a0Decent size plate costs 8 euro. Very smal brownie costs 3.5 euro. \u00a0Not to mention very very small place \u00a0 \u00a0 3 tables only. \u00a0 Cheers!",
