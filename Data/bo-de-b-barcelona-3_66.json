    "We waited for our food for almost an hour and it was well worth it. They guys that work there are super friendly (even with the constant crowd) and helpful. I had the chicken plate and it was the first time I felt full/satisfied my entire time in Barcelona. The potatoes bravas were amazing as well. Definitely get all of the sauces.",
