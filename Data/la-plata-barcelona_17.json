    "Cheap, but delicious food at La Plata. We took a one day cooking class in Barcelona, and our teacher recommended this place. She said that the sardines are super fresh. There are four items served (no menu available) - sardines, tomato salad, tomato bread, and meatball. 1 shot glass of house wine (rose, red, or white) is 1 euro.4 orders of Sardines - Delicious! How can anyone resist deep fried fish? 1 order of Tomato salad - Yum! I love how Barcelona uses heirloom tomatoes for the tomato salad.1 order of Tomato bread - Nothing special. I wouldn't recommend it.Meatball - We didn't try it since I don't eat meat.Overall cost: 18 euros. When I visit Barcelona again, I'll be back. In addition, they were open early. We arrived at 6:30pm and we were the first customers.",
