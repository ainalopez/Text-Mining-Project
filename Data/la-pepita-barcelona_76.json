    "What a charming lil place. The tapas are fresh and artistic in presentation but not too over the top where you lose authenticity. \u00a0Patience is a must for a 30-45 minute wait at peak dinner but order a glass of sangria and enjoy as you wait out front of the restaurant ( no chairs standing wait only). The staff is exceptional and offers consistent service in the warm and bustling atmosphere. We sat at the main counter facing the bar and had the fortune of meeting the owner as she smiled and maneuvered \u00a0in between plates coming and going. Sofia made sure to greet diners whether they were just staring their meal or leaving for the evening. Everything on the menu looks delish-live a little and just have them bring what they recommend. We did that and we're pleased with both fish and beef \u00a0 \u00a0tapas and everything else they La Pepita suggested. We wanted to end our Barcelona visit with a great meal but most of all a fun evening and La Pepita exceeded our expectations.",
