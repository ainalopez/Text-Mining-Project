    "La rosa negra is the go to spot in Barcelona for Mexican food, and perhaps one of the only places I found that make real margaritas. \u00a0However, the food is less than brilliant and the portions are pretty weak. \u00a0Also, the servers are not enthused to be serving Americans, I've noticed. \u00a0Its a fun spot, especially at night, and very conveniently located but not one of my favorite visits.",
