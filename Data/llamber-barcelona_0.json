    "Stumbled in to llamber because everything else was closed when we were looking for dinner at midnight on a Monday. Amazing food. Portions slightly bigger than tappas. Two people were super full after four dishes. We ordered the tomato bread (recommended by the waiter), salmon carpaccio with ginger ice cream, the tuna (amazing sauce), the octopus with mushrooms and egg which you mix into the sauce and the beef. All was AMAZING. A MUST in the born neighborhood.Loved the decor. Very inventive and modern and up cycled wood and it felt warm and cozy but still sleek and chic. Friendly staff too, amazing ! Best place we ate in our 3-4 days in Barcelona.",
