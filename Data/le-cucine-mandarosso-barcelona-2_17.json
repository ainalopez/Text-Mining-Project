    "I gave it one star because Yelp would not recognize zero stars. The pasta was overcooked and gummy, served with nondescript sauce. I think the sauce was pesto because it was green. Olive oil coated the bottom of the plate like an oil slick. The fish flakes had no flavor and I can't tell you what species of fish I was eating. The \u00a0meal was not edible.",
