    "Yummy food! It was packed, but luckily a couple was leaving, so we snagged their seats. We ordered coffee and Huevos con chipirones (eggs and baby squid in ink sauce). It was great, but a tad too salty for me. The coffee was divine. I would definitely come back here if we are ever in Barcelona again.",
