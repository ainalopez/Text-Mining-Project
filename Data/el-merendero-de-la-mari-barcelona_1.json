    "Ate with four others there and ran up an almost 300 euro bill. Food was not good. One of our meals consisted of breaded chicken and soggy French fries. The reason for the 1 star is because the service was atrocious and it's not like they were super busy. The waiter came and asked us what we wanted to eat twice before we even put in our drink order.It started raining and we had to move inside and didn't get any help- I had to walk back and forth carrying the apps, wine, and waters for my parents and guests. The normal paella was not good at all for the price. I got the fisherman's special paella and although it tasted alright going down, I ended up throwing it all up later in the bathroom.Rude staff, bad food, got sick, 1 star. The only thing I enjoyed were the desserts but even then I threw them up later so it was worthless.",
