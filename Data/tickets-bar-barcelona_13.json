    "What a surreal experience. First off, however, good luck getting a table. They open up reservations exactly 2 months out at midnight Spanish time, so 6pm EST. We were online and prepared, counting down the minutes in an effort to get a Tuesday reservation 60 days out. Nope, no luck whatsoever. After 30 minutes of failed attempts and timed out web pages, we gave up. Fortunately, our hotel's concierge was able to pull some strings and get us a 10pm booking. We happily accepted and showed up 15 minutes early to enjoy a glass of champagne in their outside waiting area. While we were there, we saw at least a dozen people try to walk up for a table and get turned away. I wish it was easier to make a reservation because I'd go back in a heartbeat. I could write about the food for the next hour, but then I'd be hungry. And you already know the food is good. It's a top 50 restaurant in the world. Here's what you might not know... it's really well priced. I'd say downright affordable, given the quality and variety of the food. It could have been double the price and we still would have enjoyed it, although we might not have rushed back for a second visit. The sommelier picked out a nice white burgundy wine that satisfied my need for a big body wine with my wife's preference for white wine. Just go. Find a way to get a reservation. Lie, cheat, steal... do whatever you need to do. It's worth the effort to enjoy this experience.",
