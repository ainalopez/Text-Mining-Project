    "This place is so awesome. When you don't know where to eat, or what you want to eat in s bustling location such as las rambles, this is a go to. It has everything you need from sushi, to Italian to Spanish tapas flare and everything prepared very well. We ordered the pizza, the tuna appetizer and the pimentos de padron which I was addicted to while traveling through Spain. The sangria was also delicious and the wine flows and is cheap. We loved the place so much that we ate there twice while staying in Barca.",
