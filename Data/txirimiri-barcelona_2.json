    "I came here as part of the Sandeman's New Europe Tours for the tapas bar hop tour. Like the tour guide said, it is one of the best rated tapas bars in Barcelona! It is a traditional pincho bar typical of Spain..pinchos are pieces of bruschettas with different toppings. The toppings an be anything really--ham salad, cheese, peppers, fish, etc---all held together by a small wooden stick. At the end of the meal, you pay based on how many sticks you have. Each stick is 1.50 euros. I had a ham salad pincho that was soo delicious. I wish I had tried more, because they all looked amazing (look at my photo!). Otherwise, it wasn't too crowded on a Sunday night, ambience was laid back and comfortable--tables not too close, a nice selection of drinks at the bar, and a bar full of pinchos!",
