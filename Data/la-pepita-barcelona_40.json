    "We came here for lunch and we noticed there were a lot of tourists, but Barcelona is touristy in general so it's okay. I had the menu of the day. It came with a small salad, watermelon gazpacho, then I could choose a pepita (I choose the bikini pepita with brie, ham, and truffle sauce), and the dessert was honey with cheese). My husband ordered some iberico ham, an anchovy with caramel sauce on toast, and tomato bread. Everything was fine, but nothing was outstanding. The pepita sandwich did not blow me away and that is their specialty here. Maybe their other menu items are better.",
