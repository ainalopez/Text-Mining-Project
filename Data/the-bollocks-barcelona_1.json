    "This punk bar is borderline cheesey, as the decor and effort to be \"punk\" goes a little overboard. However with that being said, it's a great time. The first time we stopped by, my friend was given a complimentary shot of \"poison\" by the batender and took it down with a group of locals. Billy, the bartender, has the best hair I have ever seen. Think Fabio but with tattoos, less muscles, and no accent. Billy is actually from Miami, which gave us Americans hope that it is quite possible to leave the good ole USA behind and become a bartender in Barcelona, doing what you love every night. Overall, The Bollocks was a great time and made our night in Barcelona a unique one.",
