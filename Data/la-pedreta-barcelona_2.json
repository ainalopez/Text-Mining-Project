    "Visited this place tonight and it was amazing. The paella was super fresh and the server was very accommodating considering my shellfish allergy. Service was really great and the atmosphere was relaxed. Dinner was very affordable and the dulce de leche crepes were delicious for dessert! Best service from staff since we got to Spain.",
