    "we showed up right when it opened for dinner, and it was already almost halfway full, and it was completely full within 20 minutes.we ordered sangria and tapas. try the sandwiches (we got pork loin because it was so much cheaper than the steak), pimientos pardon, and the shrimp and squid skewers. we didn't see the peppers or skewers on the menu because it was in English, but we told our server we saw them on yelp (which is usually weird to do) and he knew exactly what we were talking about and was very helpful. I swear I still dream about those peppers and skewers!! 100% going back here when I make it back to Barcelona.",
