    "This is a must see place for me being that the artistic greats Picasso and other frequented here. The inside was beautiful Gothic walls and ceiling's. The food and service was mediocre. I feel that the Restaurant sees their fair share of tourist just wanting to cash in on the historical value without purchasing anything which has worn away at the friendliness One might expect other restaurants. All in all the experience the serviceable but getting to see a piece of history was definitely worth the trip.",
