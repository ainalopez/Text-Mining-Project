    "Went here also on The Taste of Barcelona tour. Excellent food (although I can skip the blood sausage!) and the vermut is refreshing and delicious. 'Went back a few days later with two others from the tour. That time, we were crammed in by the door, and the service and vibe wasn't as positive. I think they were really slammed. The chairs/seating are uncomfortable, in case that's an issue for anyone.",
