    "Went there twice, both times it was extremely busy! So get there early if you don't like waiting. We got there at around 5pm and it was packed - we had to wait 15 minutes but we snuck a bit as well :)Had the grilled pork loin with cheese and bacon sandwich. It was excellent, the meat was very tender and melted in my mouth.Also had a cafe latte which was cheap and good (like elsewhere in barcelona).My significant other took prawns with parmesan cheese and they were sublime she said.It is very noisy so if you want to work - don't go.The staff is nice and service is quick - they need to turn tables around quickly you know!Very good experience, this is a definite place for breakfast or lunch if you are visiting!",
