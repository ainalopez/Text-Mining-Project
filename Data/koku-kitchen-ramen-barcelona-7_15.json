    "After 9 days of tapas and we were looking for soup. Being from So Cal, it's hard to please me when it comes to ramen. I have to say, their broth for Picante was quite flavorful. I did add more spice and the noodles weren't traditional style, however, it really hit the spot. I would agree with other commenters that the limonata was excellent!",
