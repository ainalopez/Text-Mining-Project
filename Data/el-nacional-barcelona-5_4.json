    "If you are not what to have for dinner, this is the place to go. Located off the very trendy Passeig de Gracia. Its in a big hall, looks like a recycled train depot station. I ended up having the fresh seafood. The oysters and fish ceviche was excellent choice. \u00a0Oysters was fresh, you can really taste the ocean. The fish ceviche was great. For main dish, I had the Grilled Octopus. It was flavorful, and very tender. Just melts in your mouth goodness. I also had a glass of White Wine \u00a0and its was delicious, goes great with my meal. For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Mouse. Its light and fluffy, it goes perfectly with my expresso.Service was excellent, attentive staff. Price was also comparable.",
