    "THIS IS A MUST EAT!! I never write reviews, so here's my first one. I am a self-proclaimed foodie and found this restaurant through online reviews. Upon arrival, not only did the famous (and incredibly kind and humble) chef seat us to a private table viewing the garden (without reservations) but he also waited on, and made several dishes for us that weren't even on the menu!! He crafted his own unique food for us and kept sending over dishes \"on the house\" to us! It was an absolutely incredible experience and I was in awe and star struck to say the least. If I ever go to Spain again, this will be my first stop! Talk to the chef! He's very sweet, talkative, and the restaurant aims to make you feel like royalty!",
