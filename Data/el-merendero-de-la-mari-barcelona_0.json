    "A friend actually recommended this place to me. We ordered the Lobster Paella, Seafood Paella and the Clams in white wine. My favorite had to be the Clams...they were soooo good! The paella's were good too, but nothing too special.Atmosphere is very nice. Probably best to sit outside for the scenary and so that you can people watch. It is expensive, but I think that's expected since this whole strip is filled with restaurants that are a bit pricey. It was a good place to go to on our last night.",
