    "Had lunch at Toto and I have to say, it was probably the best meal I had while in Barcelona! \u00a0We ordered tapas and every single dish was amazing! \u00a0The sangria was fabulous as well, generous portion and they even garnished it with a fresh pansy! \u00a0Fantastic food, beautiful presentation and excellent service!!",
