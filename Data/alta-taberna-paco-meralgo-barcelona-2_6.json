    "Have to go against at the grain of yelpers on this place. This is a tourist trap and surrounded by tourists you will be. We left this place after a few tapas and went to another restaurant to finish our dinner. Highly disappointing. The service is poor or at least very hurried. You are made to feel immediately unwelcome. We got the seat facing the wall but that didn't bother us much. Our waiter was unpleasant and slammed our food down. I thought the lack of a wine menu was weird but we ordered two glasses of while house wine and it was very reasonably priced in the end and good too. Too bad the food was bad and salty.",
