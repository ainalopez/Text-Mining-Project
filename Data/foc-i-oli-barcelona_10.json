    "One of my favorite places we ate at!! Very very small space, but the food is amazing. They mainly have burgers, but the burgers are sooooo good! They have many different options, it is definitely not your ordinary burger. Also, the service is amazing. The guy spent time with us going over the whole menu, since it is in Spanish. The prices are really good too. Overall, this place is amazing.",
