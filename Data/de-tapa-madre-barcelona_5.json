    "Beautiful place with a large menu of tapas. Helpful and patient waitstaff. We ordered some sardines, sausages, a salad, and cava, and everything was delicious. Our waiter didn't speak a lot of English, but I like practicing Spanish and would rather people not switch to English once they hear my broken Spanish.",
