    "Easily the best restaurant in La Boquer\u00eda, and believe me, we tried a lot of them! El Quim is located right in the middle of La Boquer\u00eda, so it can get pretty crowded with people all around you. The only seats available are at the bar (there is no other sit-down place) so you have to wait patiently for a seat. You are handed menus where you check off what you want to order, then hand the menu back. Among the notable dishes are the baby squid and tripe, which were just so deliciously melt-in-your-mouth. We got the recommendations for these dishes from a couple sitting next to us in the bar, who similarly raved about them and told us they were a must-try. Definitely worth it. Like I said before -- space is definitely an issue, especially if you ordered more than one dish (like we did). However, well worth it and we left El Quim super satisfied.",
