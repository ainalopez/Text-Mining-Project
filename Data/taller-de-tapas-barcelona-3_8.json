    "we arrived in Barcelona early this morning after an all night flight. After napping, we went for a walk and built up quite an appetite. \u00a0We stuck our noses in quite a few restaurants before settling on Tellar Tapas. Thankfully it was a great choice. Small plates of croquets perfectly fried, giant prawns in a delicious garlic sauce, chicken kabob and finally topped off with incredibly delicious lamb with a side of gzrklic mayo sauce.
