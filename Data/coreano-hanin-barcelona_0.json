    "Loved our meal here! We did the beef bulgogi and the mixed grill that has squid, shrimp, chicken and beef and veggies. The mixed one came w noodles. It was a lot of food for 2 people.I assume it was the owner lady who helped us with cooking at our table and showing us how each dish is eaten. She was very friendly and spoke descent English. I felt the atmosphere was nice and the prices seemed very fair. I would definitely come back and highly recommend this place for anyone needing a break from tapas!",
