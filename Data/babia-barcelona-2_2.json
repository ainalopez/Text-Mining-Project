    "My husband and I were staying at the Regencia Colon, practically next door, so we stumbled upon Babia in our explorations. It's a great little, divey bar. Lots of wonderful art all over the place. Our first night we sat down at the bar and the bartender was extremely nice. He served us up a couple of cervezas and completely excused our poor Spanglish. Our second night going there, the bartender remembered us and chatted us up. His name is Rollo and he's very nice. He gave us some complimentary beers, cheese and a cd of his band.  \u00a0The atmosphere is great here, especially if you're looking for something nice in Barcelona near all the tourist stuff, but isn't an over-priced tourist trap.",
