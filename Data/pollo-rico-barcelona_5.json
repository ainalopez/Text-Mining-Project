    "Very inexpensive place. We had the garlic chicken, a tripe dish, a couple of beers, \u00a0a couple of soups, and a couple of melons for less than 30 euros.Place reminds me of a Spanish version of n American diner but with more selection and better food. Mostly older local people eat there. \u00a0I will be going back again.",
