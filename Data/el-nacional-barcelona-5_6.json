    "El Nacional is a cute space off the main streets of Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia. It's a renovated warehouse decorated in 1920 style, and houses several different restaurants. We went with the simple sandwich shop on the left hand of the entrance for cheese and Jam\u00f3n platter, pastry with spicy Catalan sausage, desalted cod salad and chocolate crepe! This is a must visit in Barcelona. The good restaurants can have long lines during peak hours.",
