    "YUM! This place is so very tasty and I love the setup. Basically it is a buffet of tapas. There aren't any labels, but that sort of makes it more fun - unless you have a food allergy, then just ask what's in it. But they have a great selection at this location and everything is good. You can have as much as you want and at the end, the waitress comes over and counts your toothpicks and you are charged 1.70 each - pretty good deal. Even better, they are only 1 euro on Wednesdays! Love this place, will surely return.",
