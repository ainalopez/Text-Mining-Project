    "I'm not a vegetarian, but lately I find that vegetarian meals are just plain better. \u00a0Anyway, this theory led my girlfriend and me to Teresa Carles. \u00a0I will simply say this: \u00a0We were in Barcelona for 7 days, and I would have eaten here every night (my girlfriend kept bothering me about how \"we have to try other places!\"). \u00a0Great food and a welcome detour from the typical tapas places everywhere else in Barcelona.",
