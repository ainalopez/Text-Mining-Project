    "Time in Spain is all relative. Just because posted hours say 1pm does not mean that's when they open...so we waited... This place reminds me of the soup Nazi, but with sandwiches. Popular because they're cheap. Cheap is not normal in Barcelona!The sandwiches were good...and in generous portions! This place is perfect to stop by and place an order before you head out to the beach...or when you're in need of some grub in your tum, post binge drinking.",
