    "We were told that we simply HAD to hit the Moritz place. \u00a0It was near our hotel, but we didn't make it until Mr Recommender came by with his new Mrs. \u00a0It's a good thing they did, this isn't a quiet, intimate spot. \u00a0It's like an industrial themed chain restaurant, except it doesn't suck.The service was quick and attentive and everybody's food was good.The only problem is the glass floor on the way to the restroom. NOT cool, Moritz.",
