    "Went for brunch and cake for Easter brunch and it was fantastic. I've heard great things from other friends who have visited Barcelona and had to try it for myself. We were told the wait would be 25 minutes but it was only about 13 minutes. The restaurant is small but have a decent amount of seats outside. The wait staff was very polite and spoke English well. I shared the French toast with Nutella and it was fantastic. Wasn't like a typical American French toast it was sort of the texture of cake rather than bread but still super delicious. I also had the scrambled eggs with feta and turkey on a bagel. Couldn't really taste the feta but over all was really good. The presentation was great, a rustic chic look. If your in the neighborhood and have time I would highly recommend stopping in.",
