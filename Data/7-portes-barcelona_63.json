    "This is one of the oldest restaurants in Barcelona, with wonderfully old-school decor. It is worth going purely for this reason, though the paella is also really good! The traditional seafood paella is probably the most popular, and comes out nicely cooked, with that slightly crispy layer on the bottom and perfectly al dente rice. The veggie paella is less flavorful, but not bad. Honestly, there are other local joints with paella just as good, if not better (and cheaper!) But if you're into the historic feel, check this place out.The service here is impeccable, and the setting is appropriate for large parties, families or even couples. They are very particular about reservations and timeliness, so show up on time!",
