    "This was about a 7 minute walk from our hotel. Yeah, it's a little trendy, but the waitstaff were friendly and helpful and the service excellent. We sat at the bar and had a great view into part of the prep kitchen & the hustle and bustle of the staff. Pan con tomate was good, but patatas bravas were excellent (I think we ordered another). We arrived just before closing, so we didn't have a lot of plates. Just those above, olives and a couple of glasses of cava. Nice mellow, contemporyesque atmosphere.",
