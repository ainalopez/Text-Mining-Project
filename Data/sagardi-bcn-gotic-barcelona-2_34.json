    "this was our fave place for pintxos when we were in barcelona. \u00a0i think we actually came here twice. \u00a0like \u00a0the ones in basque country, everything here is on toothpicks along the counter, and you just pick what you want to eat, and they count the number of toothpicks you have afterwards. \u00a0this is a great way to try a lot of little things, and there is always something for everyone.",
