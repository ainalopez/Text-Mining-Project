    "I'm a sucker for brunch, and I was quite excited to eat something other than tapas and paella in Barcelona. Their eggs benedict on a waffle with turkey was incredible!! I loved the inherent sweetness of the waffle with the saltiness of the turkey - the whole dish was well-balanced. My love for waffles almost rivals Leslie Knope's love for waffles (shoutout to you Parks fans), and my least favorite thing about eggs benedict is the English muffin so this was a win-win! It was one of my favorite meals I had on my backpacking trip. Why haven't I had this in the States before?! We didn't have to wait for a table, but service was very slow and the food took unusually long. We also ordered coffee and asked for it to be brought out after we finish our meals, but they forgot. The restaurant has really cute decor, and the seating is not uniform. There are some regular tables with chairs, a love-seat where people eat off a coffee table, outdoor dining with table that pivots (10% extra charge for outdoor seating), ect. We were sat on shorter stools and had to eat off a very low table; I felt oversized and uncomfortable. At 5'2'' (157 cm), I had to awkwardly hunch over to eat my food, so I can only imagine how much this would suck if you were any taller. It seemed like seating for children.Service was lacking and seating situation wasn't pleasant, but I would still highly recommend this spot for bunch in Barcelona!",
