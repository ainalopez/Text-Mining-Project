    "i've been disappointed in many 'asian fusion' restaurants, but i'm glad we went out of our way to visit this place. the waitresses were friendly and very helpful, especially when it came to translating the catalan-chinese menu. the wheat beer on tap was good but i wasn't able to finish the 'porter' and can't recommend it. however, every last dish was great. the dishes that stood out were:cold aubergine: sounds weird but was silky soft and very tasty.deep fried fish: you can't go wrong with this! even though we were warned that it was VERY spicy, it was not spicy at all.bbq pork bun: perfect. but you only get one so order up!duck: we went for fatty rather than dry, but it felt more juicy than fatty.beef with pounded rice?: i don't know, it was delicious and moreish.definitely drop in if you're in the area. it was 55 euro for 3 hungry people. i wish we had a joint like this in copenhagen.",
