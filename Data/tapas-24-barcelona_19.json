    "We were here 4 years ago, when the menues were in spanish and no one heard of this place. Today it was very dissapointing. The dishes were 2 times more expencive, the food was o.k but not worth the money. We go a 82eur bill and were still hongrey.I would only reccomend it for having a dring ans a snack. Not for dinner.",
