    "It is a nice spot for brunch in a love Born area. The interior is so nicely decorated,not typical for eateries in Barcelina in general. The waiters are all polite,friendly and of course they all might easily turn to English) funny thing though, I was there on a Sunday brunch, and I only spotted one company of English speaking clients,so the place was actually crowded with spaniards!The prices \u00a0are a bit on the expensive side,but the portions are generous and the food is delicious!",
