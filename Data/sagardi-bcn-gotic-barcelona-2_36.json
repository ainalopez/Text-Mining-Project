    "My favorite dip-in, dip-out pintxos place in Barcelona. \u00a0It's a smaller place, so a more intimate vibe. \u00a0Be prepared to stand, and sometimes it can get crowded. \u00a0Drink as much Estrella as you can, and don't be afraid to throw some 'bows in order to get to the tastiest pintxos. \u00a0Try everything you see, but come back to the ones you love.",
