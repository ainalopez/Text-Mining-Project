    "I had the NYT sandwich and while I won't go into detail (the folks below me have already done a great job), I will say that it is absolutely divine and definitely worth the \u20ac6,75. The fries are also very good, and perhaps better because they give you a tiny fork to eat them with. I love tiny utensils because they make my hands look big and then I feel like a giant. Anyways, this place is super busy even at weird times so I wouldn't recommend coming here with more than one or two friends, or get takeaway. Viena is a great stop for a simply delicious lunch!!",
