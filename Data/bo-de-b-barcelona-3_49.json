    "Love this restaurant, been there about 8 times in the past year, food is super solid, but the wait is interminably long, even by local Spanish standards, and I've now showed up twice recently, once at 11:15 and once at 11:30, and been turned away, despite having eaten there at 11:50pm on weeknights before. Not cool when the sign says open till 12.",
