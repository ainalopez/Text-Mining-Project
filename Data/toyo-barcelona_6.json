    "I have eaten here twice now and both times gotten the 15 EUR \"buffet\" and have not been dissapointed! For this price (per person) you get assorted appetizers and a plate of 5 or 6 different types of sushi rolls for the table. The menu is pre-chosen but, if, at any point, you want to repeat one of the dishes, say a particular roll or another order of a specific appetizer, you can. In that sense, it's an \"all you can eat\" buffet. Definitely worth the price if you love sushi! What's not included is drinks and dessert. But if you can swing the extra money, I would recommend trying the cherry blossom ice cream! Delicious!",
