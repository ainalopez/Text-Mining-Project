    "This is probably the best and most authentic Japanese restaurant in town. Proof is that i never saw so many japanese eating in a japanese restaurant. The service is friendly and efficient and prices more than correct for what you get. Important, you must book a table because it's always full, even on week daysI will go back for sure",
