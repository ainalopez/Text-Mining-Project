    "Another excellent restaurant in the An Grup. Good food, friendly atmosphere, delightful waiters some of whom speak English. Take their advice for the specials - I certainly have not been disappointed on either of my two visits. Reasonably priced. Well situated on the Avenida Diagonal just north of the Passeig de Gracia on which they have a couple of good Tapas bars within the group.",
