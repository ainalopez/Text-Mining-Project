    "There is a secret bar behind a pastrami sandwich restaurant! The pastrami sandwiches are real and you can order them. But the real surprise is behind the fridge! Walk confidently up to the fridge and open it to discover the cute bar behind the door. :)They have some amazing cocktails with very innovative presentation. Like the Long Island ice tea in tea kettle, Kentucky breakfast in an egg, and Caribbean nights in a Bamboo glass. Everything is super delicious!Of course if you're hungry, you can still order a pastrami sandwich.",
