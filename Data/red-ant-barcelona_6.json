    "Mosquito's sister restaurant, we came here because the other was closed. And I'm so happy we did! They had one of the best bibimbap's that I've ever tasted and the pork buns were freakin' incredible. Add to that a fantastic atmosphere and excellent service, and it made for a rather pleasant experience. Actually, to be honest, I think this place is even better than Mosquito. Which is awesome, because while all those suckers are standing, waiting in line, you'll be in here feasting and forgetting that Mosquito even existed (k, maybe not that extreme, but you'll be happy). Pro Tip: They're open between 6pm-7pm, which is when Mosquito's kitchen breaks each night.",
