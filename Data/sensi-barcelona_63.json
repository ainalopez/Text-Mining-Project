    "All the staff were extremely friendly and attentive. The food was delicious. We ordered the burrata and tomatoes, baby chorizo, mushroom cream, patatas bravas, seafood paella, and truffle ravioli. Every dish was excellent! My boyfriend ordered a sangria which, according to him, was the best one he had had so far in Spain. At the end of the meal, they surprised us and poured us free shots of limoncello, which we drank with the staff. Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona.",
