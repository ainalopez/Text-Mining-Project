    "On our way from Madrid to Barcelona on the Renfe, we overheard some business men talking about their favorite Argentinian steakhouse in Barcekonaand our mouths started watering immediately! When we arrived at our hotel, we asked about booking a reservation at an Argentinian steakhouse and our concierge assured us it was probably the Patagonia near Plaza Cantalyna (I am assuming some sort of reference arrangement between the two establishments). After he booked us a reservation, we looked it up on Yelp and weren't impressed by the reviews or pictures so we did our own yelp search and found Parrilla Alfonsina and decided to go there instead - and we were not disappointed! As San Francisco, CA foodies, we were blown away by everything we had!!! Everything from the dinner roll, to the Argentinian sauce, to the rib eye, to the filet mignon, to the \u00a0cheesecake dessert - all were phenomenal! The portion sizes were quite large too so we found it to be a good value for our money! Our service was great and our waitress gave us some very honest and candid feedback about what dishes she recommended. She was spot on with every recommendation! Hope to come back every time I'm in Barcelona!!!",
