    "Bacon sandwich. Yes, bacon sandwich. And I'm not talking a BLT, people - I'm talking bacon and melted cheese between a chewy, delicious roll hot off the griddle and into my mouth. Pair that with a glass of cava rosado, and you have one happy Hily. We had heard about La Champaneria from several folks, and when we found it it was PACKED. Like, people standing in the street packed. We worked our way in and ordered two glasses of cava and -your guessed it -the bacon sandwich and we were off. This centuries-old cava bar is loud, energetic and standing-room only, which is actually quite fun and the ambience is so young, so casual and so fun that you barely even notice you're standing for hours. The guy who works the bar takes your order over and over again, as you'll most definitely want to sample all of the incredible delights on their massive menu boards that hang above the bar. I should also mention that all the meats are pilled up waiting to be grilled right there in front of you, behind said bar, and the aroma is intoxicating. We had delicious chorizo, local jamon, amazing cheeses, more chorizo, and glass upon glass of cava. At 1 Euro a pop, you can't get out of there with less than three. When all was said and done, our bill came to a mere 13 Euros - seriously. This was one of my favorite spots on our Catalonian adventure, and if you're in the area, it's not to be missed.",
