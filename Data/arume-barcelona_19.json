    "After searching for the best paella online, I decided to come give this one a try. I almost couldn't find it because I walked right past it the first time and had to double back and look harder. It's a small unassuming front, but the inside has a really nice ambiance. It's a bit small, so if you're planning on eating here, either reserve or come early (I went around 7:15PM, a bit after opening). More than half the place was full when I left around 8PM. Anyway, I ordered (of course) the paella, and after doing so, I was given bread, a tube of olive oil, and olives. There was one piece of bread, and the olive oil was quite good, very olive-y. The olives were really salty, so I didn't get around to eating them all until my paella arrived. My paella was delicious, and I've had some really good paella last time in Barcelona. The rice was perfectly cooked, and there was enough flavor from the seafood and the sauces. There was just the right amount of sauce so the rice wasn't too wet nor too dry, and it was great. There were mussels, clams, squid, small shrimps, and two big shrimps. The big shrimps looked great, but they didn't taste too good; the first one I had was a bit mushy, and the second one I had was almost mushy. The mussels were really soft and I've never had mussels like it before, and both the shells of the mussels and clams were full of flavor. It really was a great meal.Service was alright, and portions were okay. At \u20ac14.50 a serving for paella, it's a bit expensive, but the quality makes it worth it and I definitely got full after my meal. I would recommend this place, and I will be returning next time I come to Barcelona![Side note: 900th review!!]",
