    "Recently shared a delicious pizza dinner and a grilled vegetable masterpiece at Gusto. \u00a0The pizza had the thinnest and lightest crust I have ever tried with fresh tomato sauce and toppings. The grilled vegetable dish was an imaginative medley of eggplant, zucchini, peppers, arugula and goats cheese. \u00a0I'd say this place serves high quality and tasty food. \u00a0If I lived in Barcelona I definitely would return!",
