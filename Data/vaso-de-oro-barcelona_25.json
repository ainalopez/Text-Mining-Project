    "Vasa de oro ended up being one of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona! It's right around the corner from Barceloneta beach, tucked into the neighborhood right along the shore. Amazing food and drinks, great service. Their craft beer on tap is excellent and probably some of the best beer we had in Spain. We really enjoyed their foie gras as well. There are also a lot of simpler foods, such as their ham/cheese sandwich but that was still mouth-watering as well! I recommend you go there during non-peak hours to try and snag a seat at the bar or one of the surrounding tables, otherwise be prepared to stand and wiggle your way into the bar area.",
