    "This was our best meal in Barcelona. We came for lunch. The waitstaff was wonderfully helpful in recommending some truly stellar items. We ordered the tuna tartare (fabulous), the squid with white beans (amazing), garlic shrimp (perfectly cooked), the bread with tomatoes (delicious), oysters (good), and paella (the best of the trip). \u00a0The seafood was all fresh, perfectly cooked, and well seasoned. The neighborhood was adorable and the restaurant itself was nicely designed. I was so happy we found this restaurant, especially as all our other meals in Barcelona were disappointing.",
