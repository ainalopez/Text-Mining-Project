    "The Flauta is an awesome tapas restaurant! Extremely popular as well. I don't think they take reservation and you'll need to put down your name on a wait list and announce it when it's your turn. They won't sit you until your entire party is there.They have a large variety of tapas. My favorites include the fried egg with fries and spicy sauce, garlic prawn and various seafood. There's a front counter with all kinds of fresh seafood in it that you can order. Leave some appetite for desert as well!",
