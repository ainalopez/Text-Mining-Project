    "Excellent atmosphere, good food, really nice service. A little slow but understandable because of all the patrons, and a little disorganized (they gave us an extra appetizer by accident and left off one of our dishes on the bill). But they were very friendly and gave us two complementary dessert shots after our meal!",
