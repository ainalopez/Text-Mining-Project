    "I was eager to come here for a long time- and I should say, the wait was well worth it. House vermouth was flavorsome, with the right amount of sweetness, and the food - even better. Somehow even something as simple as bread with tomato tastes incredible, and tomato confit with salt cod and anchovy paste completely blew my mind. I then asked for 1/2 plate of cheese from Extremadura thinking that it would be like a piece of each of three cheese varieties - but it was so generous, in the center of the city you would pay twice for the same amount. The service was also great - fast and polite. Even if you are not around, it is absolutely worth taking the trip to Gr\u00e0cia just to check out this great little bar.",
