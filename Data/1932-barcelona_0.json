    "When we were in Barcelona, we had dinner here at this restaurant. The terrace looked a bit so-so, so at first we did not wanted to go in. We walked around the neighbourhood and came back to this place. We were not dissappointed! The place looked great inside and the hostess was nice too. De gave good advice about what we should try. Fresh made ravioli, fish package, tuna. It all tasted great. The desserts are not that special and not that good prepared. I certainly recommend this restaurant, but do not pick the desserts afterwards.",
