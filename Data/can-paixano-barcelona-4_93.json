    "My wife and I were looking for a bite to eat after biking along the beach, and I thank the other Yelpers for being spot-on with this recommendation!A clean, calm, sit-down place with explanations for the Spanish/Catalan-impaired? NO. A bustling, fun, convivial, stand-up tapas joint that serves you a glass of sweet bubbly cava with whichever plates you pointed to as they passed your head en route to other hungry patrons? YES!Don't be intimidated. Just wade in (there's more floor space towards the back of the room), see what plates look good, get one of the counter guys' attention, and order away. Turnover was quick enough that we got a spot towards the back of the bar pretty easily, though simply resting your plate on top of your cava glass (for a true tapa) is what many there were doing. We intended to visit the small store that's at the back of the room before leaving; I'm guessing they had some quality stuff. But we realized we'd forgotten only after we'd fought our way back out to the street. Next time!",
