    "Went here based on Rick Steve's Pocket Travel Book and glad I did. It is a short walk from Casa Mila. We had to wait a little bit for a table and glad we did. We went for lunch and ate chef's special which had a chouce fron three appetizers, three entrees and two different desserts for a little over 12 Euros. It was delicious and great price! The cook and waiters were super friendly and helpful explaining the dishes/menu. We were also able to sit next to chef's window which was cool as we could see she was cooking everything at that moment and very fast indeed. Do go here if on a budget and want some good food. Highly recommended",
