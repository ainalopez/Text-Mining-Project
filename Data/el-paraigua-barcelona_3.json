    "Given my state, there was no inspiration to eat well or try to eat well, so we sat in another square and ate at El Paraigua, which had the most interesting menu of the very uninteresting menus of the other restaurants in the square. I went with the Spanish omelet (which was an omelet with potatoes served with chopped tomato on the side) and the white tuna with tomato marmalade. The tuna was a good quality canned tuna (in oil) but the marmalade was far too sweet. The date had a green salad (we both started craving fresh vegetables of any kind) with apple, nuts, honey, and tomato - which looked sad and flaccid. The date said it was overdressed but not as nasty as I said it appeared. This was the very definition of a forgettable meal. 2.2 rounded down.",
