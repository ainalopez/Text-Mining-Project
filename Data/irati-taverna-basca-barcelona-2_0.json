    "Tucked in around the corner from La Rambla - this little hole in the wall tapas joint called Irati Taverna Basca. When you peer in you see a bar that is stretched along one side of the wall that is stacked with different options of tapas and the other side is a walking/standing area that is 2, maybe 3, deep. We worked our way to the back of the bar and ordered a delicious glass of Malbec from the local La Rioja area. Once we had a few sips and scoped the place out, we started getting a general idea of how this worked.All of the food was laid out on the bar with toothpicks in each piece of food and a slice of bread to hold it all together. At the end of the meal the number of toothpicks are counted and then added to your bill so it is all self-service which is nice.From the tapas we had I think we had : a crab mixture that looked like a snowball, goat cheese topped with spicy salami, a purple seafood creation that wasn't bad, and unsure about the other places.We each had 2 or 3 tapas and a glass of wine each and the total bill came out to around 20E which I thought was a good deal.I was a little leery of this place being so close to La Rambla and if their food would suffer. I was happy to say it didn't.I would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to check this place out due to its convenient location and the food was tasty.For more information and pictures check out our site : thegreatcubeescape.com",
