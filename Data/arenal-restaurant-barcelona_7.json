    "God I wanted this to be great, but overall this place just pissed me off & chapped my ass to no end. The view was spectacular and food was great & I would have given it a much higher rating but I can't. And why? SERVICE. We were seated and all was good until the waiter realized all we wanted was coffee and dessert and that's when the bad attitude began. It's not as if we had pushed our way through the line and shoved an old lady into the Mediterranean, the place was dead. He slammed the glasses on the table and almost threw the utensils at us (slight exaggeration but you get where I'm going). The Crema Catalana that Peter had was great and the fruit with Crema Catalana over it that I had was DIVINE. But the experience itself thanks to this guy really left a bad taste in my mouth. This really makes me mad because I wanted to love it and wish I could say everything was sensational. But I can't. And I hope and pray that if there is a next time (and I am one to always give a place a second chance) I get a different waiter because the view by the sea is lovely and the food was great. But a great deal needs to be said about the human factor on whether a customer will come back or not.",
