    "My husband and I are from California, and being Mexican, I know authentic Mexican food. This place is spot on! We are on our last leg of a 15 day vacation starting in Portugal and working our way through Spain. We're tired of Tapas and I miss spicy food. The restaurant is recently opened and the owners are young but they definitely know what they're doing. They're from Mexico ( Queretaro) and have brought the taste of Mexico to Spain. The wait staff is from D.F. ( Mexico City) and Veracruz. It was refreshing to hear the Mexican accent and enjoy authentic dishes and drinks. I ordered cochinita pibil (yucatan style pork slow cooked in banana leaves served with black beans and picked onions), a favorite dish I first discovered in Merida, Yucatan. My husband ordered Enfrijoladas, also delicious and very authentic. The tortilla soup had the right amount of spice, diced queso and avocado. I cook a lot at home. I make cochinita pibil, and I'm very particular about my Mexican food. The food here is made well and in house. We're going back on Sunday for another delicious meal before returning home. They also have a nice selection of Mexican beers and the prices are very reasonable. If you're in Barcelona near the Barcelona Nord bus station, take a walk up the street (literally 5 min walk toward Sagrada Familia) for a delicious authentic Mexican meal.",
