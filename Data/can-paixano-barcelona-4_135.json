    "If you like good cheap sparkling wine (cava) and you like to nibble on European snacks, such as bread, chorizo, salami, cheese, and other stuff, then this is a must go place! \u00a0Three of us polished a bottle of cava and several plates of snacks for 20 euros. Yes, it's crowded and you do have to be assertive, but it's a unique experience that we only found in Barcelona.",
