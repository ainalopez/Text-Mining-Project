    "I'm pretty serious about my vegetarian restaurants, and I've been to quite a few in Barcelona. \u00a0Veggie Garden is, by far, the best value of any veggie restaurant in the city! \u00a0For less than 9\u20ac you can get a huge amount of quality, delicious food!The restaurant doesn't have the most charming of facilities, and no: this won't be the best meal you'll ever have. \u00a0Still, the food at Veggie Garden is tasty, adventerous, and fresh. \u00a0A pretty sweet find, especially if you're looking for a casual, laid-back, quick, and easy lunch! \u00a0Awesome! \u00a0My one hope is that they repaint the walls of the interior (it looks a bit dirty/grungy now...).",
