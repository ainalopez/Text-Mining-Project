    "6 friends and I dropped in for a goodbye dinner.The goods: Garlic fries!!!! Burgers were also very delicious!! Portion was perfect, not on the huge side, but perfect nonetheless. The couscous salad was a little bland after a while, but they gave a good amount. Everything was well-priced, I think.The ambiance: Very hip and busy. Has the beach atmosphere that I'm used to in California.The service: The girl was prompt, and I was very impressed she took all our orders without jotting down a word. She was friendly and cool.I would definitely come back to try the other burgers and for the garlic fries.",
