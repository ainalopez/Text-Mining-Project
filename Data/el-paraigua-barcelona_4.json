    "Note that this review is focused on their tapas and bar area upstairs, not about their live music lounge downstairs.Decided to walk in for a quick drink and snack after a day of walking around in the sun. \u00a0We sat inside in the bar area during a non-peak time so we didn't experience the place during its a music performance. \u00a0Service was good and we didn't have to wait much. \u00a0Drinks prices were ok considering this place is located in a tourist hot spot, somewhat on the cheaper side.The tapas however was disappointing. \u00a0We had the an order of cockles and olives. \u00a0They did not taste fresh. \u00a0Barcelona has so many good restaurants the food at this place fits the description 'I've experienced better' perfectly.Again, I can imagine this place might get very lively and fun downstairs during a live music performance. \u00a0However, not a place you want to snack at based on our one visit there.",
