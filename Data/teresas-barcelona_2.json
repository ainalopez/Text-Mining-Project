    "A new trendy place opened in El Born ! Fresh cold pressed fruit juices for every time of the day. The menu is perfect for vegan and vegetarians with salads, toasts and burgers. I had the guacamole toast with grapefruit which was really good even if the bread was a bit dry. My friend has the pink salmon burger which actually tastes as good as it looks. The purified water is amazing, especially in Barcelona where the water is very chlorinated.We shared the pear and chocolate vegan muffin which was very tasty.They have a huge range of cold pressed juices, nuts and seeds milkshakes and smoothies. The only drawback would be the price : 7,95 for a toast with guacamole... And 5,95 for a fresh juice, If you know what I mean...The place is quite nice but very small, its better to take away or make it delivered thanks to take it easy. In a nutshell : a pretty healthy place perfect for vegan !",
