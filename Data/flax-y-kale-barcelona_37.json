    "To whom it may concern; zero stars wasn't an option. As a general Barcelonian youth I hereby declare this establishment the most unsatisfying restaurant out there. Don't let the other reviews fool you. Unless you're less than 45 kgs and treat all things flavor as if they were the devil, I don't recommend it. I've had sandpaper and dry wall that tasted better than the excuse of brunch this place served us. I would stay clear of this place unless bird seed and soil are your go-to snacks.",
