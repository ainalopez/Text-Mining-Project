    "This place is really cool. \u00a0Great atmosphere with penned graffiti everywhere in the restaurant. \u00a0We had some assorted tapas which was wonderful but they saved the best for last which was the Pepita with fried egg and foie gras the sand which perfectly blends with the bread for a taste that is fantastic to say the least. \u00a0If you are reading this and heading there I am already jealous of you.",
