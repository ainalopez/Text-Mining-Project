    "A personal favourite. Stumbled across this place years ago with some friends, and am pleased to say hasn't changed much in that time. Its not much to look at and its smokey and small, but your guaranteed good quality bar snacks and wines. For somewhere thats right in the middle of a very touristy area, it successfully shuns becoming a tourist trap itself. Go and check it out.",
