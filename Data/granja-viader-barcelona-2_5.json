    "Cute, family-run business dating back to 1870. My family was walking around the area and after seeing all of the dairy products in the display case, decided to pop in for a quick snack. Because we're tourists in Barcelona, we ordered the Crema Catalana, which was delicious! The texture, the glaze, the large portion size, it was all so heavenly. To be fair, I also love Creme Brulee...I know they're technically different, but can't say that I would be able to tell them apart. I wish we had been hungrier because the cheeses and everything else on display looked wonderful. Crema Catalana, I'm coming back for you!",
