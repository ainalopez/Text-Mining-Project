    "One of the BEST meals I've ever had!Great food, amazing service, and terrific location! I went with a large group of coworkers during a business trip and we ordered a variety of tapas and fresh sangria. The paella is DELICIOUS--a must-have! The group I was with loved the meal so much, we made another reservation before we left Barcelona. Terrific experience all around--highly recommend!",
