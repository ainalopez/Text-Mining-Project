    "If you want the perfect little cervezas And tapas in Barcelona in the best neighborhood then come here. My wife and I came here because it had good reviews. To be honest we came here our first night in Barcelona and came back here for our last night because it's that amazing. The entranita was the best meat we had in the whole city. The beer called \"Mahou\" were served in the perfectly sized glasses and for some reason their tap created the best taste. Anyways I can go on and on so just go here, you won't be disappointed.",
