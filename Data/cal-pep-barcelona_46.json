    "This place reminds me of the soup Nazi in Seinfeld. \u00a0The restaurant (more like a hole in the wall) has no more than 20 seats total. The restaurant opens at 5:30, but knowing that this place is VERY popular and will have a queue, we got there at 5. \u00a0We were the first in line, but then some other crazies arrived soon after us. \u00a0By the time it opened, there were at least 20 in line. \u00a0I'm not sure if there is a menu, and if there is, then I sure as heck didn't' see it. \u00a0The chef asked us what type of food we like, and we told him seafood, so he cooked us an assortment of seafood right in front of us. \u00a0The food was very nicely seasoned and tasted fresh. We paired the seafood with a few bottles of white wine and socialized with other customers who were visiting from other countries. \u00a0The atmosphere is lively and from their faces, it is obvious that everyone thought the food is superb. \u00a0Two hours or so later, we were finally done and our stomachs completely satisfied. \u00a0By the time we were ready to leave, the queue was long and people were probably giving us the evil eye as we were the first ones in, but not the first ones to leave. \u00a0I highly recommend that you check this restaurant out if you are in Barcelona. \u00a0Just expect not to find out how much everything is until you get your bill. \u00a0We didn't care since we were on holiday and enjoying this exceptional meal, but the damage was pretty bad.",
