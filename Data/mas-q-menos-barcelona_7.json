    "Very friendly staff who speaks English. \u00a0Very basic tapas - mostly cured meat, cheese, salad, and sandwiches. \u00a0No hot tapas - which I was hoping for. \u00a0A good place if you want a no frill, basic meal with wine. \u00a0We had the meat combination (salami, ham, etc), ham with Brie sandwich, veal sand which, and turkey salad, and most importantly..a glass of Rioja.",
