    "This place is known for their vegan burgers. All of their patties are made fresh, and are on display for you to choose. The complexity and variety of the patties is the best I've ever seen. Their burger toppings are also very good. I can't remember the name of the area that Gopal is in, but it's an area full of vegetarian and vegan restaurant's and cafe's. You will also find many youngsters and street hipsters here.",
