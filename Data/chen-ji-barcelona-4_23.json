    "Look for Chen Ji, 1 metro stop from Placa Catalunya, Tetuan, near Arc de Triumpf. The neighborhood is filled with Chinese restaurants and bakeries, many as good. The prices are very low, a huge bowl of Won Ton soup filled with won tons and greens is only 2.5 euro. Many noodle dishes with chicken beef or pork and greens are under 5 euro. The fried and steamed dumplings are great and authentic.",
