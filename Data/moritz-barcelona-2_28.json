    "This place was fun and very cool for us. HUGE menu with a great selection. They brew their own beer here and the beer is actually good.We tried tons of bites, there is a fun ambiance, and it gets crowded but there is plenty of seating. You HAVE to see the bathroom area. They have the brewery below with cool glass bottom floored hallways, the bathroom itself is even cool. Would definitely come back if we come back to Barcelona.",
