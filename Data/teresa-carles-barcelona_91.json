    "It's rare to find places that experiment and explore vegetarian food. Teresa Carles creates fresh, seasonal dishes that are elegantly composed and very well presented. The place itself is cozy and busy - the way you want it to be. Excellent wine menu and service just puts the icing on the culinary cake that is Teresa Carles..TL;DR: Just eat at Teresa Carles. It's awesome!",
