    "This place is good!.. On a Monday night this place was packed, so we were seated at the bar - which was great. The waitresses were friendly and service-minded in a cool and down to earth way. The tapas was great and innovative and the prices were more than okay. We also had red wine and after-dinner drinks. We recommend this place to visit in El Born.",
