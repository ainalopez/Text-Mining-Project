    "Really one of the best dining experiences I had in Barcelona. \u00a0The food was top-tier in quality, taste and presentation. Service was impeccable and swift. The octopus starter is amazing and beautifully presented. The lobster rice is sumptuous and tuna steak juicy and full of flavor. The tiramisu dessert is heavenly. Loved the intimate ambience and srylish, romantic decor.",
