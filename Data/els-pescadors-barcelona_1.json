    "Nice off the beaten tourist path place to eat. \u00a0It's in a nice little square with trees that my children would love to play on. \u00a0Next time kids.- The dinner salad was fruity and nutty and a good starter- The baby squid were simply amazing. \u00a0Tender and full of hearty flavor- My wife's salty cod tomato rice was rich, creamy, and delicious- My fish prepared in a suquet sauce was succulent and savory. \u00a0Mixing it with the potatoes was perfect- Service was perfect",
