    "So refreshing, so flavorful and so full of delight. We enjoyed this place so much, we ate there he first 2 nights, and had to seriously resist for the third of our time in Barcelona. We recommend everything we ate which includes the tuna burger, veggie burger, salmon on quinoa, and green ravioli, kale chips and grilled watermelon. Absolutely exceptional.",
