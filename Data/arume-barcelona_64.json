    "We went to Cera 23 first, but since they had a long wait they recommended we go to Arume (1 min away, same owner, similar menu).I went to check out Arume and it was such a great place! Service was attentive, food was delicious, and mojitos are mind blowing. Glad to find this restaurant on my last night in Barcelona.",
