    "My husband, sister and I decided to try this place after the yelp reviews. The tapas was delicious. You have to try the calamari with kimchi aioli. Everything was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. We had the beef skewers, bravas, and the beef pepita and tuna pepita. Couldn't fault anything. It got packed with people waiting, so get there early from 730pm.",
