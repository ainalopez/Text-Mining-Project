    "Great seafood paella that's worth the money (note; they do have the option of making it for one person with a 2 euro surcharge). Also tried their potato with three sauce tapa, which tasted so awesome I even ate all the potato skins. Beautiful decor and ambience. Top notch service. Very glad I was able to eat here for my last dinner in Barcelona.",
