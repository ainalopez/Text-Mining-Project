    "We had one of the best meals of our lives here! \u00a0All of the dishes were innovative, beautiful and scrumptious! \u00a0Easy to reach from all of Barcelona and well worth the visit. \u00a0We've been fortunate to have traveled the world on business and pleasure staying in all major metro areas. \u00a0La Forquilla produces delicate creative cuisine that is the best our cultures have to offer. \u00a0Bravo!!",
