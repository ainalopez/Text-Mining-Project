    "I came here for dinner last night and still can't stop gushing about this place. I like Thai food. Although I haven't been to Thailand yet I can easily distinguish authentic cooking from nonsense some places make and call \"Thai\". \u00a0This is a small, cozy, family run joint. You'd expect the \"real deal\" in a place like this but Wow! was I blown away. The lady running the kitchen is an amazing chef, this is the time I wish I spoke Thai and thank her for all the wonderful food she makes. It's made with love and you can taste it in every bite. Here are some dishes we sampled: green papaya salad, coconut soup, shrimp tempura, red curry shrimp, and duck with tamarind sauce. Everything was incredible, the red curry was one of the richest and flavorful curries I've ever had.Oh, and if you like spicy you're definitely at the right place, just make sure your palette can take it. (they can make it reaaally spicy, if you ask for it) Can't wait to go back and try more.",
