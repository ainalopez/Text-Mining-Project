    "I am an Indian living in Los Angeles, and have eaten Indian food everywhere, LA, London, New Delhi. \u00a0The food was surprisingly authentic. \u00a0We had asked for it to be spicy, and the food was what we would expect in India. \u00a0My only caution and the only reason for giving this restaurant a 4 stars was the goat meat, some pieces were tough, and to be fran, outside of India, I have had a hard time getting to be the same quality that I get in New Delhi or other parts of India. The host is refreshingly Indian and I would suggest that you stick with the chicken or lamb and you will get a truly engaging experience of Indian food cooked well, with the spices being properly cooked and nicely marinated in the meat and vegetables. We ordered Goat Karahi, Aloo Gobhi (Cauliflower and Potatoes) and Tandoori Roti (Whole Wheat Tortillas) all of which was fantastic.",
