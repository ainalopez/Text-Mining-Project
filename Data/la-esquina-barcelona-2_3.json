    "This place was walking distance from our hotel, so we thought we'd check it out. Very quaint little place, busy, farm house feel. I like their menu options where for a set price you choose a starter (soup, salad, etc) a main course and a side. Also comes with a (non-alcoholic) beverage. The food was prepared in front of you basically (you could watch the chef work) and it was very fresh! Had the polenta, pasta and veggies.",
