    "This review is more of a bookmark of a place I WANT to return to and try out. Their burgers looked great. \u00a0Prices were reasonable. \u00a0The music playing in the background was fun. \u00a0Staff was friendly... and the coffee was good. \u00a0It was a shame I'd already eaten earlier.So - good vibe and ambiance... i hope the food is as good... real review and write-up coming soon.",
