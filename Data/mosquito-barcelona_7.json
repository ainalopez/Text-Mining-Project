    "Asian tapas or dim sum, whatever you wanna call it, it was pretty good! I was very pleased with the quality of the food. The duck was crispy and delicious and the dumplings were exceptional. The sichuan beef was a little bland, but thankfully they had some sriracha to help solve that. The staff was very helpful, accommodating us on a busy night and in general being very available. They had the best selection of Catalunyan craft beer of any of the places I visited in Barcelona, which was something I could really appreciate being a beer lover. I only wish they had them on tap rather than the German/Belgian selection that had.",
