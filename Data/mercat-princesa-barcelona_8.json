    "This is like the fanciest food court ever. \u00a0A very cool space filled with all types of fooderies and bars specializing in everything from sushi to paella to sandwiches to egg dishes to booze. \u00a0I accompanied a friend while she got some eggs with ham and mushrooms over fried potatoes that she was mad for. \u00a0Still full from my snacking at the Mercat de la Boqueria, I settled for a delicious but extremely expensive sangria.Looked like there might be a couple of vegan options in the way of tapas (like padron peppers), possibly some veggie paella, or gazpacho. \u00a0Be sure to wind your way through all the options before you decide! And totally mix and match from the different stands!",
