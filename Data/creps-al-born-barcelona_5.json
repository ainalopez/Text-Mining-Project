    "Creps al Born is truly a night and day experience. We went here for crepes in the afternoon one day and had really tasty crepes and cold coffees. I thought this place was simply a great lunch spot with good coffee. Fast forward to the following evening when we were walking to the hotel and we saw this place was packed at night. The atmosphere changed to tropical party on the beach with great music and a fun crowd. We samples several cocktails and each was amazing. They use fresh fruit and juice in a lot of their drinks and some even have a creative twist like an added fire. It was the perfect Barcelona night experience. Just go and see for yourself!",
