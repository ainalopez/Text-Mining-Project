    "Service so bad we came back twice. Food was hit-or-miss, with one dish (the sun-dried tomato zuchini and beet thing) so over-salted it was impossible to eat, and others being pretty great (squash blossoms).The service was insane. Took 30 minutes to ask us for our drink order/bring water etc. both times, and generally were understaffed/rude/ridiculous. You know that thing where you think maybe the person serving you got fired because he hasn't been back in an hour with your change, or maybe your table is in an invisible zone. Quite different from Teresa Carles. Cool to see this kind of spot in BCN, but definitely will not return. Stick with Zen",
