    "Picked this restaurant because of a blog I read from an avid traveler who'd had an excellent experience here. So glad we took his recommendation! First, \u00a0let me say that this is a nice restaurant but small. \u00a0Reservations should be made, once a number of seats are filled they do not accept walk ins.They have a prix fix menu with tons of options that I highly recommend, the price includes wine or sangria (an entire bottle), a great value! \u00a0However, \u00a0if you would rather, \u00a0there's a separate, \u00a0a la cart menu as well. Upon seating, \u00a0everyone is greated with a complimentary glass of Cava. For our first course I chose the charcuterie platter of meats (a huge sampling) that included salamies, ham, etc. My boyfriend chose potatoes with foie gras and fried egg. This may sound random, \u00a0but it is amazingly delicious! For my entr\u00e9e I ordered seabass and he ordered the steak. \u00a0Both were great. I was served a whole fish, I just kinda stared for a second and asked the server how I begin to filet the fish. The owner/chef was behind her heard my request. \u00a0He swooped in, took the plate and a little later returned with the fish nicely fileted and ready to eat!For dessert we had the cream brule, \u00a0well, Spain's version. \u00a0It was just okay. \u00a0Top sugar was a bit burned. But, \u00a0our server gave us a lemoncello instead, much better in my opinion! \u00a0This restaurant serves delicious food with great service in a nice atmosphere. \u00a0I'd definitely recommend.",
