    "One of my fondest memories of Barcelona! \u00a0By all means have breakfast at Pinotxo in the Boqueria! \u00a0Juanito's smile is contagious, and his food is superb. \u00a0All of the dishes, whether sweet pastries or savory egg and seafood dishes, are phenomenal. \u00a0The coffee drinks are all outstanding. \u00a0There is almost always a wait, and it is always worth it. \u00a0Go and enjoy!",
