    "We liked this place so much we visited twice during our very short stay in Barcelona. The tapas menu is limited but they do it quite well.The dishes I remember:1) Broken egg dish - This has to be the upscale, Spanish version of Denny's grand slam. Perfectly fried potatoes topped with a \"broken\" fried egg and Spanish ham. We were practically licking the plate.2) Codfish croquetas - Fried in a non-greasy way with excellent non-fishy flavor. Delectable fish balls.3) Truffle hamburger - Doesn't seem particularly Spanish but I'll tell you it was particularly good.Frankly we ate ourselves a little sick here. Must have been good though since we did it twice.",
