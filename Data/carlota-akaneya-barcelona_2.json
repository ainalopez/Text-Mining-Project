    "Authentic feel for Japanese grill: tasty Kobe beef, real coal on your table and fresh vegetables served a la carte (enoki mushrooms, onions, soy sauce, corn, etc) \u00a0Great service and friendly atmosphere make this feel a lot more like a family place than any other Japanese place in the city.",
