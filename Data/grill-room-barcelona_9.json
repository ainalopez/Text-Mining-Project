    "As we were walking up the street, we looked in the windows and saw such a beautiful looking setting that we just had to go in. by the front door, we saw some signs in the window - and one of them just sealed the deal for us: \u00a01 euro for a cana & tapa. \u00a0sold.we went in, sat at the bar, had a couple of beers and tapas. \u00a0what really stands out is the decor of the place - it's a stunning grand dame of a building. \u00a0anything art nouveau makes me swoon. \u00a0as for the full menu, i haven't a clue what's on it or what the prices are like. \u00a0but the service at the bar was great. \u00a0we were really happy we popped in and got 2 beers and 2 canas for under 5 bucks.",
