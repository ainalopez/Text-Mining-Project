    "One of the best nights of our weeklong trip. Charming gentlemen behind the bar humorously peddling their delicious wares. Very reasonable pricing. Terrific meat tapas. Very good selection of vegetarian tapas make this a high priority tapas bar for those with dietary restrictions. A true authentic experience and on a charming narrow thoroughfare where locals outweigh tourists - come around 9-9:30p to catch seats at the bar. Would easily come back and bring friends on return to Barcelona.",
