    "This place was referred to us by our hotel during our stay in Barcelona and I would highly recommend them to anyone else visiting this beautiful city! Great d\u00e9cor inside, very modern yet cozy and chic. The food was amazing, I would say one of my favorite tapas restaurants in Barcelona and by far the best Tortilla (Spanish Omelet) I've ever had. Make sure you check their downstairs too with a lounge and bar.",
