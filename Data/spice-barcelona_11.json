    "Been coming for years 'cause I adore this place. Delicious cakes & cookies --homemade of course -- baked with the freshest ingredients possible. Coffee is great too! Today I had the Ted Velvet Cake, a spongy layered cake made with tangy buttermilk. Delightful! Try also the famous carrot cake, the crumbly Dutch Apple pie, or the homemade Oreo cookies, about 3 times the size of the originals. Spice also rescues vintage recipes from oblivion, such as the adorably-named Lord Baltimore cake and its counterpart, the Lady Baltimore (one is made with egg whites and the other \u00a0with the yolks, though I don't remember which is which). The prices are surprisingly low, for the quality of product offered. Only \u20ac3,90 for a generous piece of these amazing cakes: that's just crazy. As far as atmosphere: Here you get a truly familiar, neighborhood feel. If you're ferling a little down, this is a good choice, as a constructive, positive energy pervades the place. (It may have to do with language conversation classes that are always taking place here.) The fellas who run it are amongst the sweetest (no pun intended) human beings you'll ever meet. What else could you ask for from a simple cake shop in Poble Sec?",
