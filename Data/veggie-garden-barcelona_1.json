    "An eclectic atmosphere that try's real hard to make good food. A mix of india Korean Nepal and Thai thrown in. Great prices. Thali was good but daal could have been more savory. The mix veg is good and the amount will fill you upLove the small tapas but they Re filling. Tofu with peanut sauce is good but dos not enjoy soba noodles as much as they were dryThe moma ( Nepali dumplings ) were superb",
