    "Very disappointing experience. We went there for dinner, the food was a bit of a let down, the highlight of my dinner was the grilled watermelon and goat cheese starter, as a main I had the cod which was quite disappointing, it was a bit tasteless and swimming in oyster sauce broth. My partner had the kale soup which was lukewarm but nice and very nice kale chips as a starter and a bit of a let down burritos as a main.That most annoying bit of all dinner was that the restaurant was freezing and we had to put our jackets on. Service was friendly.I prefer the other restaurant, Teresa Carles, it is warmer and the food was nicer.",
