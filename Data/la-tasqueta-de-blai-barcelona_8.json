    "I was only in Barcelona for two days, and I went here both days because it was just that good. If you're the sort of person who enjoys tasting a variety of different options, but doing so affordably, this is the best place in Barcelona. In fact, this was my favorite place to eat in Barcelona period.Aside from the specially marked items(as designated by a different color toothpick), all the pintxos are 1 euro. ONE EURO for a rotation selection of 30+ items, all served on a piece of toast as a vessel for the delicious ingredients on top. And you have great variety, from various different types of fritters and sausages, to brie and fish combinations, to eggplant dishes. They even have dessert pintxos running at the same price; Where else can you get tiramisu, profiteroles, or creme brulee for a euro each? And the turnover on these dishes is fast enough that you will generally get fresh pintxos whenever you stop by.Keep in mind this place gets packed, and for good reason. You'll grab a plate, self-serve and grab as many as you want, and then head back to the front to pay(they charge you by counting toothpicks). The service here is impeccable too. Had one friend who was gluten free, and when she told them the Head chef specifically remade all the dishes she requested, to cater to her dietary restrictions.Tl;dr. 1 Euro Pintxos. Great crowd. Get full of 5 euros, or be like me and drop 25 attempting to try everything. GO HERE.",
