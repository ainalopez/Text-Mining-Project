    "Our hotel (W) recommended coming here for seafood. It's within walking distance of the W (1.1km...around 10 min walk). It's by the sea with an oceanview and multi-levels. We had the seafood croquettes to start which were good but most of the seafood filling was just a seafood paste rather than real chunks of seafood. We had the grilled salmon with sea salt and that was cooked perfectly. I had the octopus Galacian style and it was very soft. Portion sizes are good - just right. For dessert, I had the Catalan custard with coconut ice cream. When we asked for just one dessert to share between the two of us, they split the dessert portion into two dishes which made it easy for us to eat and each half portion was seemingly a full portion on its own. They have English menus and the manager and some staff know English. The bill was around 57 euros (we only had one bottle of water, no alcohol).",
