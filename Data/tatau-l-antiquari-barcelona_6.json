    "What a special restaurant! The waitress and her brother explained that they use their recovered Catalan family recipes to create the menu, which they change often. I have a lot of food restrictions and they were extremely receptive to changing ingredients but still keeping the integrity of the dish. The portions were huge and the prices reasonable. The waitress was very personable and attentive. True Barcelona gem.",
