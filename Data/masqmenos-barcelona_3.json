    "SO happy to see this place has 5 stars; deservingly so. My bf and I stumbled upon this place while trying to eat at Cerveceria Catalana, which had over a 1-hour wait. We headed to MasQMenos to grab an app and glass of Cava (local sparkling wine) while we waited to heal our grumbling stomachs. We never went back to Cerveceria Catalan for our reservation and had one of the most romantic nights of our vacation. We ate the meat plate (I don't remem what it was called!)-- various types of salami and iberico ham with breadsticks and bread drizzled with olive oil and an orderof olives. We each had a glass of wine as well. Everything was delicous and we were not rushed at all. Other diners next to us got some kind of panini or flatbread with salmon that looked fresh and delicious. I would DEFINITELY recommend a stop at this restaurant for lunch or dinner-- prices were also very reasonable. We walked nearby after our light dinner for churros and chocolate at Cafe & Te, which made for an \"authentic\" and wonderful first night. I would have come back to MasQMenos again if we didn't have so many other places to try. Definitely make it one of your stops and order the ham plate (pictured)..even if you don't generally eat such things at home and order a glass of cava-- it's cheaper than the water.",
