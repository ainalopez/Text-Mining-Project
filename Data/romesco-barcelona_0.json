    "Romesco is pretty solid, NOT touristy spot near las rambas.can be a little hard to find but, it's worth looking for it.food here is reasonable priced (think less than 10 euros) and they have a big and varied menu.my main plate was a rabbit with fries and it was pretty good.also, i tried the cuttlefish which was cooked to a perfect level.recommended for fellow tourists.",
