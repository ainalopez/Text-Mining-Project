    "What an awesome, surprising way to spend lunch in Barcelona, just a few days after arriving from the Bay Area in California and lamenting what I've heard to be a lack of authentic Asian cuisine in BCN. The vegetarian ramen was amazing - close second to ramen in Tokyo where I've tasted the best vegetarian ramen they claim to offer. Plus a great atmosphere and welcoming staff. Being Irish, the proprietor speaks perfect English and was happy to have us there and chit chat while we were waiting for our noodles to come out. Definitely come here if you're a fan of ramen - can't comment on the non-vegetarian options but the veg was excellent!",
