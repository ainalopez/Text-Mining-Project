    "Al Passatore is right in the middle of the touristy section of El Born. But this doesn't mean it's a bad thing.. We stopped off here because there was an empty seat in the outside seating area. \u00a0The staff serving were very pleasant and helpful. I ordered \u00a0bruschetta and a barbecue type chicken pizza. The Mr ordered, \u00a0mozzarella sticks and another pizza. Unfortunately our starters arrived after our pizzas. \u00a0The bruschetta was awesome - and made me realise just how different (in a good way) olives are in Europe. The pizza was probably one of the tastiest pizzas I've ever had. Pricewise, I thought it was cheap. \u00a0And not just for being a tourist tap, \u00a0but just genuinely cheap - \u00a0less than \u20ac30 for the two of us, \u00a0including drinks and tip!",
