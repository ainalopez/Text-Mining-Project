    "A small restaurant full of locals located in a back alley of the Barceloneta neighborhood. Unique in the sense that there is no seating, rather just a single bar where customers can order tapas and cava for extremely cheap prices. I have been several times, and at all times of the day the restaurant is packed. I have tried around 5 different options, all of which have been very appetizing. Food, atmosphere, and prices are all incredible.",
