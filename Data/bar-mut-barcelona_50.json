    "Best meal in Barcelona! Bar Mut is located near the beginning of La Rambla, the popular main street in Barcelona. It's not cheap but the tapas are amazing. We got this chorizo and egg dish with lobster and fried potatoes on top - drool. If there weren't people around, we might have picked up the plate to lick it clean. We went during lunch when it was less busy but it seems reservations would be a good idea.",
