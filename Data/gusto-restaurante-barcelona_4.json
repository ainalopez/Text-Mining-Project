    "Well, we've been to but NEVER EATEN in Napoli, so we are unable to comment on the authenticity of their offerings, BUT the deep-fat-fried calzone du jour was quite tasty and definitely different from any other calzone we've tried! \u00a0The chocolate \"souffl\u00e9\" was actually a (delicious) molten chocolate cake a la mode. Can't say we minded the misrepresentation in the least. The calzone was huge and easily shared (as is the case with many of the entr\u00e9es, we understand), but the dolce didn't follow suit. It was individually-sized; so if the pair of you have sweet teeth, order two. The Peroni on tap was a plus.",
