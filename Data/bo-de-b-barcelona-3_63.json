    "Typical bocadillo, or sandwich, in Barcelona: Baguette and paper thin layer of Spanish jamon or cheese (both in rare cases). Bo de B bocadillo: Fresh baguette, hearty chunks of grilled chicken or steak, heaps of fresh vegetables and rice, and generous drizzles of tasty sauces both spicy and cool. Hands down best sandwich spot in Barcelona. Not worth the wait when lines are long, only because you might actually have to wait an hour to have your sandwich. Come at obscure hours and relish in being the first and only one in line. Minus one star for Bo de B placing the raw meats next to the rice, salmonella is real!",
