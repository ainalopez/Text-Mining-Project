    "This place rocks! We had a group of 12 and we shared a bunch of different tapas. The sangria was amazing... Not too sweet. The service where is your phone and they even brought us a free sampling of their acorn liquor. It was so delicious that three people bought a bottle of it. I bought two bottles of their red wine. \u20ac10 apiece! Oh, and one more thing... And the check does not include tip and there is no space for it so tell them how much to add ahead of time.",
