    "Our first experience with Jamon Iberico came from our Spanish friend who filled his entire suitcase with it when travelling back to London for school. After trying we knew this stuff was special. He told us while in Spain to check out Vienna and to try the \"Flouta de Jamon Iberico.\" Needless to say, it was amazing. This meat looks like prosciutto but has a much deeper and richer flavor. The flavor has a hint of nuttiness but also tastes creamy at the same time. This is an absolute must try while in Spain, especially because the price of this ham is extremely expensive in other parts of the world.",
