    "Wherever you go for dinner in the area, skip the dessert and head to Belgious. Made to order crepes and waffles topped with anything your heart desires... Bananas, chocolate, whipped cream or top it with a scoop of their gelato. They have an assortment of about 40 different gelato flavors in the back and are happy to offer samples, not so common in Barcelona. I went for all natural vanilla frozen yogurt. So good on top of my plain brown sugar crepe. Prices are reasonable - average 4.50 to 5.50 EUR depending on your toppings. Same as you'd pay at most low to mid range restaurants in the area for dessert.",
