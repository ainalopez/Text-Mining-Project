    "A little Beers' heaven in Barcelona. If God likes beer he has given us BeerCaB. 30, they have 30 beers of tap, all craft beers. I have not seen this kind of numbers in Barcelona yet. You can choose from a Lager, Stouts, Porters, IPA, etc, etc. They have their on tap menu online, so you can choose from your smartphone what is going to be next. The place is new, well decorated, with a big low central table that can fit al least a dozen and the rest are high tables with stools. THe only but is their food menu. I have been there 2 times and the prices are too high for me. They have their bravas deconstruction that it looks really good, but I am not going to pay 7euros for a plate of bravas in a craft beer bar. I have notice that they offer a weekly tapa cheaper, maybe that's the way to go.",
