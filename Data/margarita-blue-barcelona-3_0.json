    "4 star cause the cocktails were pretty good. Food... well if you love Mexican food, don't order anything Mexican here. It's not Mexican. It's basically sloppy joe mince in a fried tortilla. Total let down. Looking on the pics from their website, they might actually have decent food outside of the Mexican. So don't not come here based on my disappointment in my bad mexican that left me with bad heartburn. he he.They have a nice selection of cocktails. \u00a0The interior looks really cool. I imagine it's a nice place on a Saturday night.",
