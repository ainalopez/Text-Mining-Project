    "Well we almost missed our ship because of this awesome restaurant. We enjoyed a very nice and casual lunch here... Sharing a very large paella, fresh bread, and some olives. The paella was as expected: very good. The service was also great.The benefit of this place is that you're close to La Rambla and our hotel in our case (Le Meridean) but not so close that you're paying the La Rambla Tourist PremiumI highly recommend this little joint to anyone looking for a very substantial portion of excellent paella.",
