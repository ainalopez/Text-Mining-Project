    "The decor is simultaneously ultra-clean modern and homey, which is not an easy balance to strike. The food here was great but truth be told, it was the impeccable service that transformed a dinner into an experience. Everyone from the owner on down was very friendly/helpful; plus they hooked us up with extra dessert and cava. Made my girlfriend very happy, which makes me happy.",
