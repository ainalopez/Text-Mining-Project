    "Asian tapas, kind of dimsum style. It's a unique concept and it works pretty well. That said, it's suuuuuuper hard to get a table, so I'd recommend getting there at 7pm (that's when the kitchen opens at night). Food is a bit greasy, but definitely satisfying. As always, we ordered too much, but it means that I can tell you with confidence that my top choices were the dumplings, lemon chicken, and pork belly. Oh, and the Punk IPA is a great wash down. Pro Tip: If you can't get a table here, try heading down the street to Mosquito's sister restaurant, Red Ant.",
