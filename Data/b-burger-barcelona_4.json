    "3.5 stars. Friendly service where our waiter was helpful in recommendations. Pretty presentation. I had the Jamon Jamon and it was good, but not the best burger I've had. The meat could have used more seasoning and the ham didn't add any flavor to the burger. It just made me crave a better burger with thick slices of bacon.",
