    "To all the vegetarians in the world: There is a heaven for us! And it is right here, in Barcelona.What I loved? Everything! Starting with the interior, which is kinda granny/down to earth style, to the waitress (so so sorry, but I cannot remember her name) who was sweet and funny and fit to the place perfectly, ending with the FOOD!!!!! Sophisticated, interesting dishes are served excitingly presented and the taste was awesome! We shared 2 types of starters and my partners main was a Risotto (and with that a true meat eater has almost been converted) and my choice was a delicious Tofu dish. Words cannot express what it tasted like, you gotta try it for yourself....My 2nd favorite highlight \u00a0was the extensive wine list, which reminded me of yelp: you can write your own \"reviews\" about the wine you drank in that list for others to read! Funny and a cool idea, based on a juicy tip we \u00a0opted for the Habla del Silencio.Veggies in the world: gather and make this restaurant a place of pilgrimage.",
