    "They had a nice variety of pintxos (better than Blai 9). This was the only place during our trip where we had to put our name on the waiting list for a table on the terrace. things to note:- there a 2 Blai Tonight shops next to each other- it was very packed and stuffy inside both places.- they charge 1.20 euros per pintxo for sitting outside.- I didn't understand why but we were told that we could only order from one of the stores. this sucked because they were certain items in 1 shop that never made it to the other shop. otherwise, service was quite attentive and it was a good experience.",
