    "Great, authentic-feeling paella place in the Barri Gotic. \u00a0Went for a late lunch one sunny day in April and saw mostly locals in here. \u00a0The decor and vibe here is old-school and authentic. \u00a0It's clear they've been serving these same staples for years and it's no wonder. \u00a0The food here is very good and the service is friendly and helpful. \u00a0We both ordered paella, of course, and it was excellent. \u00a0Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking for an more authentic Catalonian experience.",
