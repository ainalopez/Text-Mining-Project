    "This was a stop after visiting Parc Guell. \u00a0As we've done in almost all the places we've visited in Barcelona, we chose to sit at the bar, order a beer and a few tapas and pintxos. \u00a0Their version of patatas bravas was a bit on the dry side and their pan tomate was soggier than what I would have liked. \u00a0The star of their menu is definitely their many versions of \"pepitas.\" \u00a0We ordered the \"Golden Pepita\" which came with a tender slice of beef and foie gras - this was delicious. \u00a0Other than that, I don't think the location or the menu is something I would necessarily return to or recommend. \u00a0It was located in a larger street and not necessarily in a smaller, tucked away part of the street that truly adds to the romantic dining experience in Barcelona.",
