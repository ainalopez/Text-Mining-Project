    "Amazing food!There are not too many vegetarian meals in Barcelona, and being a vegetarian tourist, I yelped this place and went immediately. They have 3 menus, Spanish, Catalan, and English, which was already very nice. GREAT menu and food, my mom did a build-a-salad, and I got the mini burgers. So why four stars? Now for the service... I guess everyone was nice, but it took a very long time. Possibly because we were the English speakers? I'm not sure. However it took forever for them to bring out the mini burgers- way after my mom's salad, and the Catalonian women next to us who ordered pasta at the same time as us were already done eating by the time I got my food. Still well worth it though, I want to go back for the food asap (:",
