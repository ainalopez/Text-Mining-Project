    "A truly memorable experience! \u00a0Hisop delivered on all fronts - atmosphere (intimate), service (impeccable) and, of course, the FOOD (to die for)!Knowing that it was my fiancee's birthday, the restaurant went above and beyond, bringing out a pair of amuse bouche's as well as a small dessert to help us celebrate. \u00a0Even beyond that, my fiancee is gluten intolerant, so they actually got us some gluten-free bread for her to munch on!The menu changes seasonally, so the restaurant is constantly evolving and experimenting. \u00a0Both the food and the wine tries to adhere to traditional, local cuisine and modernize it with a few special touches.The one thing I regret is that we did not try the tasting menu - a couple next to us decided to get it and we felt like we were salivating every time a new dish came out for them! \u00a0Guess we'll just have to come back again and try it!",
