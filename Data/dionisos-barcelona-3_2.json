    "Go here for the Menu del Dia. 10 euros gets you a drink, appetizer, main course, and dessert. It's quite filling, and pretty much all of the options are really good. The selection is quite widespread- I tried to order the sampler appetizer to get a taste of everything, and have tried many different things from the pasta to the gyros. The service was consistently very good, especially for Spain, and I found the waiter to be incredibly personable.My only issue is that on one visit, it was incredibly warm inside. Not really sure why this was, as it was cooler outside. Nonetheless, \u00a0it is an awesome deal for quality food in Barcelona.",
