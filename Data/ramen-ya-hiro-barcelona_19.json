    "This place is really great! The ambiance is really friendly, and it's really popular among experts on ramen. A really nice thing about this place, is that you can ask the waiters for suggestions if you want, and they'll help you out if you're not quite sure what to get. I completely recommend this place. The reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is that the service was really REALLY slow. To be fair, it's a fairly small area for so many people waiting to be seated, so they must have been really busy. We waited so long for the waiter to come ask us what we wanted for desert that we didn't end up getting desert. The food took a while to arrive too, but when it did, let me tell you, it was amazing! I really recommend this place, it's an adorable space, with a really sophisticated air.",
