    "si si si Gut in my belly! I love that it always feels inviting by the kind host and chefs/servers. The personal attention to high quality ingredients + creativity and diner satisfaction is applaudable. Perfect for a romantic dinner or intimate gathering with friends. A long list of savory vegetarian options, home-made desserts, and seeded bread to start! *it is possible to bake non- dry white bland baguettes in Barcelona ;) A beautiful dining experience.",
