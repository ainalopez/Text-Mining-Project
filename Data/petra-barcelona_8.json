    "Good place for dinner. \u00a0We arrived at 8:30pm, and of course were the first people there. \u00a0Can't get used to the late dinners in Spain. \u00a0By the time we left, the place was packed. \u00a0I started with a couscous, melon, and anchovie salad that was very good and different from typical american salads. \u00a0I had the bacalao, which was good, but I keep forgetting that I prefer fresh fish rather than the salted, preserved bacalao. \u00a0Last time I had it was in Portugal ten years ago, and I seem to forget. \u00a0But, it was good nonetheless. \u00a0My wife had salmon salad and then a chorizo pizza, and she loved them, especially the salad. \u00a0For dessert, a dense flour less chocolate cake that was decadently rich and dense. \u00a0Great place, great location not too far from the Museo Picasso in the Gothic quarter.",
