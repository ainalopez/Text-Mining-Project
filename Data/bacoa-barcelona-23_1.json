    "If you're looking for a really hearty meal in Barcelona, this is it. Their burgers are huge. It's greasy, filling, and heavy, like in the States. They have so many different flavors and cuts of meat, and different toppings. I got the beef burger with a potato crostini and melted cheese. Yup literally as rich and as satisfying as it sounds. So good. The burger got everywhere though!Four stars because it was soooo huge and messy, and I would rather pay less for just a slightly smaller burger. Also very unfriendly for vegetarians!",
