    "Totally awesome place with friendly staff and great food!! So fresh!!We had 4 dishes: chickpea (my fav), shrimp (so fresh), \u00a0grilled peppers(refreshing ) and white beans with squid (flavour explosion in your mouth).It's funny since we went to a diff place a stones throw away from this place a few days ago (Ramblero) was the worst experience in Barcelona ever, and this place was the best!You may have to wait behind people to get a sear like a total stalker, but it's worth it!! \u00a0If your looking for great food, attentive friendly staff, come here!!Ps..Granpa Rocks!!!",
