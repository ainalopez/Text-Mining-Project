    "This review is going to be a little vague so apologies in advance! We had quite a bit of trouble finding the place as the address doesn't seem to want to compute with google maps but got there in the end. This cute little place does really lovely Catalan food and while it was just over a month ago that we ate here, my memory has faded fast. The things I do remember: - the decor is simple but lovely and you will feel so comfortable you will never want to leave. Rustic, warm and welcoming. - the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly and will help you decide what to order for both wine and food- the food is supremely excellent. We shared some started of meats and cheese and only because I was being polite, I didn't wolf up all the food on the table. - for mains we had a steak and I had tuna tartare. While the tartare was not the most filling dish I'd already filled up on bread during the starter so I didn't go hungry. \u00a0I would love to visit here again next time I return to Barcelona but fear I'd never find it. It is worth it though, so track it down.",
