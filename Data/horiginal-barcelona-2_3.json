    "Horiginal has a good location in El Raval with pleasant outdoor seating. However, the food is mediocre. I would stick to drinks here. I ordered fideu\u00e0. The noodles were partially charred. The mussels were dry and gritty. One of them had broken shell pieces in it, and another was full of sand. My boyfriend's penne with tomatoes was mediocre. Our lunch came out to about 26EUR, including a couple of waters.",
