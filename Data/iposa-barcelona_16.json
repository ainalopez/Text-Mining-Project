    "We ate here three times during our trip. Each time the food was amazing. For lunch they have a Small menu that changes each day (not sure if specific days has certain items.) Three items to choose from that includes soup drink (soda, water, wine or beer) and main course for \u20ac7,00. Amazing price and flavor. \u00a0Dinner was equally as food, except this menu seemed to be consistent. \u00a0Tiny place, wonderful food and staff and the artwork on the walls was fun as well. \u00a0Cannot recommend this place enough.",
