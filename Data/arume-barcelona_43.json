    "We got super lucky with two bar seats without a reservation. At first we were surprised at the yelp reviews (5 perfect stars, really?) - but this place did not disappoint. The food was absolutely fantastic and well priced. We got two cocktails - the kiwi sake and the blackberry mojito both of which were very complex and delicious. For the entree we shared the chorizo tacos (a must \u00a0- we almost fell off our bar stools because it really was that great) and for the main we had both kinds of paella. The two paella dishes (duck and seafood) were very different, and I would recommend trying both. For dessert we had the sorbet and sponge. All up our bill was only 66 euro \u00a0... a bargain for this quality of food! We could not stop gushing about this restaurant all the way home!",
