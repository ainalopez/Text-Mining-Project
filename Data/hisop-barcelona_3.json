    "Worth every penny! I went with some friends for my birthday and was very pleased. As I don't eat pork or beef, I often have trouble with tasting menus, but they were very accommodating and willing to substitute items where I couldn't eat something. They also offered to sub out the oyster in one of the dishes for another item for those that aren't partial to oysters, which I found very nice. The service was great, the food was excellent. Deserves its Michelin star!",
