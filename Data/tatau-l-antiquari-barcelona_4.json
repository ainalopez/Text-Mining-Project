    "This restaurant is rustic as heck. If you are looking for a really authentic Catalan experience, this is it. Like others have mentioned, the menu changes everyday and the staff here are just awesome and warm. We loved the decor and the service. We got the sea bass, the kidney in guisado (??) and the trotters. The kidney and the trotters were a little too rustic for me, but my dining companion couldn't get enough of them and the staff brought me bread so I could sop \u00a0up the delicious sauce. If you're like me and get a little weirded out by kidneys and trotters, then go for the safer options because these guys don't compromise on the authenticity! I ended up ordering the scrambled eggs with sausage and ham and I wish I had been hungover because that dish was perfect hangover food! This restaurant is a complete departure from the touristy places around Barcelona. Highly recommended!",
