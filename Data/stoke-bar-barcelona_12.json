    "The best daytime tapas in the Gothic this week. Potato bravos with spicy sauce, garbanzo beans with Catalan sausage, scampi with rosemary, tomato bread. The wines were delightful, robust and everything on budget. Flat screen tv, cozy decor and colorful English waitperson. Finally we found our spot! Definitely a go to asap.",
