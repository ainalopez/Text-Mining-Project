    "Great food. Decent lunch special prices during the week. I love the tapas assortment and the chicken with mustard. My favorite Greek place in Barcelona... who doesn't like hummus? \u00a0Service is slow, but I think the owner is the elderly man. Great place to sit outside. Really nice greek white wine too.",
