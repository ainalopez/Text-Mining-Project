    "Far and above my favorite tapas IN Barcelona. So much so that I went here 3 times in 6 days. Seriously great food and wonderful service. If you enjoy seafood you'll be in heaven. Tuna tartare was my favorite dish. Also loved the swordfish, salmon with mascarpone cheese and the mussels. Paella and ravioli were good too. The sauv blanc wine is a beautiful addition. Top marks. Love this place !!",
