    "I've eaten gyro & kebab from Turkey, Greece, California, and New York. This place is good! It's also ridiculously cheap and satisfying, especially late at night when there isn't an option for a sit down. Service is slow. However, the Doner kebab is in sandwich bread, soft but bread. Durum is the way to go for more of a wrap situation that I'm more accustomed to in the US.",
