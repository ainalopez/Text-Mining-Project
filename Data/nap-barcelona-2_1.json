    "Real talk: My friend and I were in Barcelona last summer and sick of all the shitty tourist places to eat we kept stumbling upon and really wanting some freakin' pizza.Cue our walking tour guide who suggested Nap. To say we love(d) (we'll be back) is an understatement. We went back 3 times on our 5 days in Barcelona (to be fair, we only ate there twice, once it was closed) and to this day every once in a while one of us will text the other saying we need to go get some Nap!I don't recall our pizza selections, but we didn't have one we didn't like. My friend even accidentally ordered a calzone-type one and it was delicious. The salads were also good that we had, though we accidentally ordered the tuna ones, and despite me not really being into canned fish I ate it and it was fine.If you see a theme, it's that they don't have English menus. So I guess just be aware of that and do your best. It is quite small and popular (amongst the locals - yes!) so you might have to wait for a table. But completely worth it.",
