    "We wanted to go to a good seafood restaurant and searched here on Yelp and then this restaurant came up. We were a bit sceptic because of the size and where it was situated, but we had a really lovely dinner and the food was so lovely. The atmosphere in the restaurant was autentic and the waiters was really nice and helpful. There was not noicy like in many other tapasbars in Barcelona.Next time I come to Barcelona I will for sure visit it again and also recommend it to others.",
