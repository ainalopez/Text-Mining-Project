    "This place was fantastic! They literally are a vegans/vegetarians dream- yes, even a meat lovers dream as well.... We came in super late around 11:45pm and they still took us in, which I am so glad they did. Service was quick and the waitress suggested the hummus and pizza so we got both. Their red wine for the night was to die for and we ended up buying a bottle for \u20ac14 which isn't too bad for an organic wine. The pizza here was perfection - they actually load cheese on it like they do in Chicago which made it feel like home for me. After dinner they came out with two shot glasses of some kind of digestion aid (it was awesome whatever it was).....The atmosphere is very laid back and the staff and service was phenomenal - I'm happy to have found this gem in the heart of Barcelona!",
