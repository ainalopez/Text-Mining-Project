    "This was one of my favorite eating experiences in Barcelona and lord knows I had a lot of eating experiences! \u00a0The place is right at the entrance to La Bouqueria and is pretty much like a small bar with stools. \u00a0The competition is fierce to grab a spot but we walked around the market then came back and snagged two chairs by pure luck. The little old guy behind the counter sports a stylish bow tie and takes his food seriously. \u00a0There isn't really a menu to speak of which was fine since my Spanish wasn't really up to par anyways so it was pretty much a point and shoot deal. \u00a0We ended up with squid, lamb chops an awesome spinach dish, some roasted chickpeas and two glasses of the house red. \u00a0Altogether a fantastic meal with some great people watching!",
