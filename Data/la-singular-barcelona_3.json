    "Nice and relaxed restaurant in Gracia. The service is excellent compared with many other places in that area. You actually get new plates and cutlery with every course, which regrettably is not normal in regular restaurants in Barcelona. The atmosphere in this small restaurants with only about 7 tables is warm and welcoming. The food is good and prices are alright, however the portions could be bigger. Meaning without a starter you almost definitely will end up going home hungry unless you are on a diet. Three stars as opposed to four because the food was good but the portions to small for the price and the food not good enough to justify that small portions. ;-)",
