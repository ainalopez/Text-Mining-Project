    "One of our best meals in Barcelona. \u00a0I do think it depends on what you order here. \u00a0We stuck with Iberian Pork Ribs and paella and they were excellent. \u00a0The pork was a huge portion and when it was sat down in front of us we were a little overwhelmed but we ended up eating the whole thing because it was so tender and flavorful. \u00a0We really enjoyed our meal here but I can say I think the service isnt the best and we had to really work to get drinks refilled and so on but this was still a really enjoyable experience. \u00a0Sometimes its what you make of it not the servers.",
