    "Had the best Paella in Spain at Bosque Palermo! Found this restaurant on Yelp and the high rating is well deserved. Ordered some appetizers and the Paella Racion for 2 (20Euro, see picture, seafood paella, it fed 4 of us), and Parilla Pescado (18 Euro, mixed seafood grill. Both were very good but the Paella was probably the best I ever had. Came on Friday night at 8pm without reservations but had no problem getting in. They do take reservations and I recommend you do.Highly recommended!!!!",
