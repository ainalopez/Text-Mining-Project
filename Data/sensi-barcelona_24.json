    "BEST meal I had in Barcelona!Came here without a reservation, but they gladly seated us without a problem. Place was already packed so I highly recommend making a reservation hours before.What I tried:Saut\u00e9ed Squid with Garlic and Parsley - SOOOO yummy and soft. Usually cooked squid can get super tough, but this was just cooked SO perfectly. No fishy flavor whatsoever.Saut\u00e9ed mussels with red curry and fresh basil - quite possibly my favorite dish here. Was a little skeptical in ordering this since curry + mussels didn't sound like it would work, but OH EM GEE! A MUST dish.Seafood Paella - another excellent dish. Can't go wrong with paella in Barcelona :)Salmon Mini Burgers - probably my least favorite of the 5 dishes, but not bad. It is what it is, just mini salmon burgers... no flavors that make it pop. Mushroom something - was kind of like mashed potatoes with very little mushrooms. good, but not what we were expecting at all. This place is super small and is constantly busy so it gets really hott. Buy a beer or 5 to solve the problem. If I'm ever back in Barcelona, this is the first place I'd stop by to eat :)",
