    "Eating on an uber-touristy street like La Rambla is something I try to avoid in pretty much any city in the world. However, after a late morning visit to La Boqueria market (which was awesome), my wife and I were starving for lunch. We planned on Pinotxo, but they were closed for renovation...thoughtless of them! :( So, lacking a Yelp restaurant idea, we started to...just...look around for a random place to sit down to eat. Aaack! How un-Yelpy of me.Not only is Egipte on a tourist street, but there was an aggressive woman out front hawking for business. That's also usually also a red flag for me. So running short on time and long on hunger, we succumbed to her pitches and sat down for lunch.The good news is that I have no bad news to report. The beer was cold, the food was good and the service was prompt. I initially was enticed by the menu del dia, but we decided on tapas instead, which were fine. I recall enjoying the Ensalada Rusa, but my wife didn't like the mayo. We ordered carefully and I recall that this was one of our least expensive meals in BCN. So if you find yourself near La Boqueria and looking to sit down for a reasonably quiet lunch, Egipte is a solid choice.",
