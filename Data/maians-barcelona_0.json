    "Oh wow, Maians was AMAZING! Our dinner here was the absolute best meal we had during our entire time in Barcelona; you should make every effort you can to eat here if you like seafood, paella, or both. Everything about this place was amazing, from the ambiance, to the service, to the food, to the wine, to the great value the entire meal was.Maians is a quaint little restaurant located in a mostly residential neighborhood a few block from the main drag and central square of the 'Barceloneta' neighborhood. Don't let the dimly lit street scare you away, there are actually a couple good restaurants over here, and it's well worth getting off the main drag where restaurants are both pricier and not nearly as good. It's also a pleasant stroll from the old city; it's only about a 15 minute walk from the Gothic Quarter. We ordered the squid ink paella as well as patatas bravas and a bottle of wine. We had a hard time deciding between the traditional and squid ink versions, and I'm sure the other dish would have been great too, but we were glad we ultimately decided on the squid ink. The only downside to this dish is it really didn't have any vegetables in it (no surprise for Spain). Aside from that, it was amazing. The patatas bravas were also good, and the wine that our server chose for us paired very well with both dishes and was super reasonable. The entire meal came to around \u20ac40, which was a phenomenal value considering what we would have paid either in the touristy parts of the old city, or even back home in the States. You MUST eat here!!!",
