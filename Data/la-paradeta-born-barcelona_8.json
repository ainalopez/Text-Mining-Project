    "What an amazing experience for lunch! If you've ever wanted to have a seafood feast with some bread and wine, this is a must-go. No reservations, so you can make it on the spur of the moment - Walk in, choose from seriously fresh seafood of all kinds, then sit and wait for them to roll out out, grilled, steamed, or fired depending on which suites the item.",
