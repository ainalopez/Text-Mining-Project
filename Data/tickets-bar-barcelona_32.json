    "Superb meal . . . Not too much to add to others, but here is a brief review: the olives and airpuffs were sublime--never had anything like them before, and the flavors were wonderful. \u00a0My surprise plate was the Bok Choi and tuna tartar -- I could have had a meal on these alone. Foie gras was near perfect, and our chocolate waffle dessert was exceptional. \u00a0All around, an excellent meal from beginning to end.I'm giving 4 stars . . . service was very good, right up until the end. As we were being served last portion of tasting menu, two parties of what we assume were locals arrived -- and we were nearly forgotten. \u00a0Also, it was obvious two waiters were sniping at each other over something--don't want to be a part of it, thank you. We \u00a0eventually took our bill to the front of the restaurant and asked them to process our credit card. \u00a0Made an A+ evening an A- . . . and it didn't have to be that way. \u00a0That aside, a wonderful gastro experience.Cheers!RS",
