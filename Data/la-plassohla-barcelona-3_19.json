    "We visited this spot simply based on the Yelp reviews and the fact it listed Live music. Well it was disappointing. Very, very, very small plates and quite pricey. Yes they spoke English, a plus but there are many more options in the area. Btw, Live music was only on Sundays. We won't visit again.",
