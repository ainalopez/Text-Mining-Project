    "What a wonderful find in this city! Not only is the decor innovative and pleasing to the eye, the dessert is scrumptious. We got the lemon meringue pie, and it's probably the best I've ever had (and I've had a LOT of lemon pies). Service is good and staff are very friendly. Tea is served in cute floral teacups, and the loose leaf tea is of pretty high quality. There are gigantic mushroom statues in the back, and it definitely adds to the charm of the place. Overall, great place to stop by if you're in the area!",
