    "My crew and I stopped in for some wine & tapas. Our server Sheila was amazing! She guided us in selecting our wine as we all had different styles we wanted. She then gave great recommendations for cheese board & bravas plate. The atmosphere is warm and inviting with very friendly staff. I found prices to be very reasonable.",
