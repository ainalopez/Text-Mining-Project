    "Tapas for 1 euro. Crowded at night. Sometimes got to stand and eat. Not for the claustrophobic. Not sure how it is during the day. Beers on tap. Music in the background but not too annoyingly high. The selection of tapas are impressive for being such a deal. They change the plates around just in case you can't get to one side. It has been a favorite of mine out of all the other tapas bars on this street.",
