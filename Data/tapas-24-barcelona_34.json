    "The place itself is near calle Gracia, and that means touristeee. it is a small joint and usually has a line but its totally worth it. Everything on the menu offers a unique flavor. we orderd the bombas, chorizo, tacos from menu of the day, gin n tonics. everything is top notch here. From the drinks to the service. Best tapas ive had in the BCN",
