    "Good sandwich but slightly over hyped.I tried the chicken sandwich, and asked them to put whatever on it that they thought would be good. \u00a0It had avocado, beans, cabbage, tomato, cilantro, and some other things. \u00a0Tasty, and affordable.The service was quick and friendly. \u00a0I would recommend getting your sandwich as take out, because there was a line every time we walked by (no matter what time of day). \u00a0It was absolutely a good sandwich, and easily transported to the local beach. \u00a0I do think that I referred the shawarma wrap that I got a couple of doors down, and there was no line.",
