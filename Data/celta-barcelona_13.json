    "Walking through a small alley and my husband spotted this bar/restaurant opening. Decided to give it a go and it was a great decision. Tapas everywhere! We ordered tortilla de patata (potatoe omelet), patatas bravas (potatoes with spicy sauce - best we've had here in barcelona), salchichas (sausage), & cod crocuettes. Since it was just opening it was pretty empty but the food was good and the guys behind the bar tried to communicate in English as much as possible! Very fun way to end our trip in Spain.",
