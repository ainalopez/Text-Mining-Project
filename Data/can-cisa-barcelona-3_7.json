    "Amazing & extensive wine variety. We had a table of 9 in the wine room and it was an amazing experience. We tried everything from Cava, Pinot, Cabs, to so much more I can't remember ...Which is a great testament to our delight in the variety and suggestions. Staff here is passionate and knowledgeable about wines and seasonal dishes. We tried practically everything on the menu. My favorites were the burratta and the eggplant. Local vibe & we made reservations due to the large party.",
