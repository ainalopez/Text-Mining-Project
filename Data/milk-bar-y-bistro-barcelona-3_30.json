    "Oh man the food was so delicious and the service so friendly, I wish I could leave a raving, 5-star review. But they forgot our order and we waited nearly 45 minutes for it. We were starving. They were super apologetic and offered a couple of free drinks while they quickly whipped it up, but still we had an overall disappointing time as we watched everyone else eat first. Maybe I could suggest reminding them if your order doesn't come in 15-20 mins - they are fast, and it shouldn't take that long! As soon as they realized our ticket was lost, they brought it out asap and we enjoyed it immensely. Waitstaff was nice. I'm repeating myself but it truly was a delicious meal and if I were rating it on the food alone I would not hesitate to go for 5 stars.",
