    "Doesn't live up to the hype. While the vermouth and the service was among the best I've had in Barcelona, \u00a0the same can't be said for the food. \u00a0The only food my wife cared for was the potato crisps- something that was so simple, a kid could have made it. \u00a0 The pork rhinds were also quite underwhelming. \u00a0Being from El Paso, chicharrones are something that I've been familiar with for a long time, due to neighboring Ciudad Juarez. \u00a0I have to say, Mexico does it better. \u00a0Maybe my experience was an anomally, but all but one place I've been in Barcelona that has a hyped up reputation has been underwhelming (The exception being Vaso De Oro).",
