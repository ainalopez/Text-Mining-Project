    "Stepping inside I was initially worried by the smell in the restaraunt. No, it didn't smell bad - quite the contrary. It smelled fresh and clean - like the living room of a new home. More to the point, it didn't smell like food, much less delicious crepes.Fortunately the crepes were quite tasty. The lady had some sort of vegetable crepe that was essentially a crepe with a nice vegetable stew spooned inside. Mine was less exciting but likewise flavorful - egg and chorizo.A nice stop while wandering down Leitana to be sure.",
