    "The best bar we have been so far. It is cozy, the cocktails are just perfect (more or less EUR 5 each). With the cocktails, I suggest you have the nachos with guacamole and chicken. The bartender is really friendly. When we went, we talked for hours.Check out the shots in the jars. Our personal favorite is the caramel banana. During weekends, try to go around 10.30 so that you can find a place to sit. A place to go, if you want to have fun in Barcelona.",
