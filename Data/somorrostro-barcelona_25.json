    "This place has it all!! We were looking for a local inexpensive place and stumbled on a hidden gem! We had no idea how wonderful this place would be, from the wine (bocos Robles) to the pork with melon and ceps! I highly recommend this place to tourists as well as locals! The service was also impeccable! I can't wait to come back on our next trip to Barcelona!",
