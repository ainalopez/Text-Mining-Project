    "Delicious food! \u00a0The tuna tataki with avocado cream was amazing. The Rainbow Roll was the most impressive version I've ever had. \u00a0We also sampled the miso black cod, which was as good as any we've tried (we usually order this off any menu if it's on it). \u00a0The vegetables in the vegetable tempura were julienned before frying, which made them more like french fries -- they flew off the table, everyone was eating them so quickly. \u00a0The meat and vegetable gyoza was also very good (but they only serve 4 for one serving, down from the usual 6 we see at other restaurants). \u00a0We saved room for the triple chocolate mousse which was satisfying and delightful.The only complaint I have, which sends them down a star, is that the service was really awful. The waiters are rushed and busy, running food from the chefs to tables nonstop, yet no one could really tend to our needs and give us water when we needed it, or the check when we were ready.",
