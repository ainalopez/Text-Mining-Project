    "even with our limited diets, we were able to find plenty to eat and dined here three times during our stay. my husband wanted to try every marinated vegetable in the display case (they were mostly crudite style), but the tortillas are the main attraction.we were there around 4 in the afternoon and it was nearly empty. when we were there at lunch or late night, it was super busy. it is obviously a place were many regulars dine and we loved feeling like we were in on a local secret. the decor is 40 years old, but it's kept fresh and feels like a mod mod world. the woman who is depicted in the wall murals with her camera flash being the lights on the walls (brilliant) is the wife of the owner. one of the staff members was kind enough to answer our questions about the history of the restaurant. it's a fun place with great service, fantastic food, and one of a kind decor. even the bathrooms are fabulous. i loved our experience so much, i bought a tee shirt.",
