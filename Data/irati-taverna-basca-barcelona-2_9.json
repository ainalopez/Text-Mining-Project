    "Wow, this was the first place in Barcelona where I was blown away with the food. It is close to the Cathedral, so there are a lot of nice (lots toursity) shops around. This place is great. So the way this works is you ask for a plate, and literally pile whatever you want on the plate. In the end, they count how many sticks you ate and you pay. I think it's something like 1.80 Euro per stick, which is not bad considering you can get maybe 4 or 5 of these and be full. It may be because most of the tapas are on a slice of baguette, now that I think about it.My sister was not a fan of the combinations of the food, so find yourself to be sensitive to certain foods, you may not enjoy it here. However, since I practically will try anything, I had all of their weird looking foods, as well as whatever my sister didn't like. They had little sandwiches that were like sliders, seafood tapas, cheese tapas, and ham tapas. It was great. I was a fan.While I did find this to be not a bad price for my dinner, it can definitely add up, especially if you have a huge stomach. But, it's worth it.",
