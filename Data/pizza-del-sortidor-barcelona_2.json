    "This place is delicious. We were traveling through Spain for several weeks and we're looking for something besides a ham sandwich and found this place. The atmosphere is chill and relaxed, the service is very good and the pizza is delicious. The dough is soft and doughy. They have solid options for toppings, and the price is right - - on Wednesday Pizza was half off. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a chill pizza at the right price.",
