    "Warm, buzzing vibe and endless smiles. There was a wait outside the door m, but the hostess jotted down our name and escorted us to their bar a few doors down. We ordered a cocktail and app (different menu) and before we were halfway through, she popped back in to grab is and take us to our table. The food was fresh, a little on the salty side, but overall great. The highlight was the pumpkin gazpacho. The veggie pepita was unique and nicely prepared, too.",
