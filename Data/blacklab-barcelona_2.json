    "I was in Barcelona for three and a half days. \u00a0I had multiple burgers. \u00a0BlackLab missed the mark by a mile.We showed up late one night, lured by the rave reviews and the prospect of an Asian-infused brewpub. \u00a0The reality failed to live up to the hype.We started with the veggie gyoza (5.95 \u20ac). \u00a0For nearly six euro, you get just four tiny dumplings. \u00a0My fiancee mentioned they tasted like they'd been frozen.I had the BlackLab burger (with beer cheese, carmelized onions, bacon and a portobello mushroom - 14.95 \u20ac). \u00a0The bun was completely flimsy and totally fell apart the minute I tried to pick it up. \u00a0I hate that. \u00a0I spent most of my meal shoveling fistfuls of dripping meat into my face with my bare hands.I should also note that BlackLab served up the single least flavorful french fries I've ever encountered. \u00a0It was like eating limp, barely cooked potatoes.For a brewpub, its beer list was woeful unless you like pale ales. \u00a0I ended up drinking something that tasted like liquid Sour Patch Kids.Our server didn't speak much English, which is fine. \u00a0I'm visiting his country and the menu was in English. \u00a0I'm just mentioning that in case you prospective diners have a weak Spanish game.They did have some nice live music, which was cool. \u00a0But the food and beer was a huge letdown, and that's the main reason you go to a place like this. \u00a0Disappointing.For a superior Barcelona burger, head to any Bacoa location or check out Foc I Oli.",
