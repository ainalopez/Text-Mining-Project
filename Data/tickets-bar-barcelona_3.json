    "We had a magical evening at Tickets. The atmosphere is lively and fun, unlike so many other restaurants with such a reputation. The kitchen is split into several stations so our table felt as if it was IN the kitchen. Our staff was attentive, with at least four different members helping as during our meal. Orchestrated chaos is the only way to describe how the staff work in concert with each other moving from table to table and dish to dish because at most restaurants you'll enjoy three or four courses, but at Tickets we had 30!The food is incredible. The Tickets olives are small wonders of intense flavor packaged like an unbroken egg. The beet cake melts on your tongue leaving only an amazing flavor behind. The mushroom noodles were my favorite. These are not traditional dishes so open your mind to a new experience in food.Reservations can be difficult to get but if you're prompt on the website you will get in. Also, when compared to similar restaurants around the world Tickets is not extravagantly priced. Our meal was about 82 euro each.",
