    "Like many others, we found this place in a guide book. \u00a0My brother thought this was the best meal he had in Spain. \u00a0I also thought it was very delicious but we had so much good food in Spain that for me, it wasn't The Best overall. \u00a0We ate the following:1. \u00a0Eggplant and goat cheese terrine - this was delicious, my favorite dish here and one of my favorite dishes in Spain2. \u00a0Cod - this was okay. \u00a0It was a little too bland and fishy for me.3. \u00a0Sausage - this was good. \u00a0Tasty but I've had better sausage. \u00a04. \u00a0Risotto with duck liver and mushrooms - this was delicious, very creamy.This place was full of American tourists who also probably found it in a guide book. :)The location was a bit hard to find. \u00a0It's near a church in one of the alleyways of the Barri Gotic area. \u00a0The interior is romantic and dark - which I loved (although I was with my family). \u00a0I also noticed that many of the customers were in dressier clothes than in other restaurants. \u00a0I was in my sightseeing clothes though (capris and tank top) and I did not feel out of place.I thought the prices were quite reasonable for what you get! \u00a0Our waitress was also nice and attentive. \u00a0I'd eat here again.",
