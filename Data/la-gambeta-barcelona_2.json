    "After our very disappointing dinner, we were told that the management had changed; perhaps that explains the gap between our experience and the previous reviews. \u00a0The servers were pleasant but made multiple mistakes including bringing the wrong entree and telling us they no longer prepare the two tapas we ordered...but not telling us until after we got our entrees (too late to substitute something else). \u00a0We asked for bread, and it arrived, but we had no plates. \u00a0One waiter smiled and called it, Murphy's Law, but didn't offer a dessert or glass of wine. \u00a0The lobster was grossly over-cooked, and the shrimp were NOT fresh. \u00a0We suggest that our hotel stop sending guests there until they get the kinks out. \u00a0We tolerate poor service when the food is good, and vice versa, but this was a bust all around (and not a bargain)!",
