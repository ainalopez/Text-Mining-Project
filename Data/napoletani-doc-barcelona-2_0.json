    "Awesome Pizza. As Barcelona does not really have many good pizza places and lots of bad ones, this one definitely stands out. I had a Diavola which was excellent and my friend the Napoletani D.O.C. that looked amazing and tasted even better than it looked. The pizza is made in an oven that is situated in the entrance of the restaurant and you can look the cook over the shoulder while he is preparing your pizza if you care to. We did not eat in the restaurant itself (take-away) but from what we could see it was quite a big place, functionally furnished and definitely suited for going with big groups of people.",
