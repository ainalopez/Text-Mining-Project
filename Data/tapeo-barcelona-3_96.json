    "Best tapas place we went to while in Barcelona. Everything was great. The beef cheeks were to die for. All the croquettes we amazing. The ribs were deliciousThe sangria \u20ac14 a liter was delicious. I would recommend this place to any if my friends that are within Barcelona. The key is to get a reservation or get there early because this place only sits 20 people and its a hot ticket.",
