    "Great Asian fusion spot . I was here 2x for lunch and it was excellent every time. They have good selection of rice, ramen or curry dishes, as well as options of pork, fish , chicken or vegetarian. I'm usually not a fan of pork but their pork ribs are to die for! Fresh ingredients, good flavors and pleasant service not to mention very affordable lunch options.",
