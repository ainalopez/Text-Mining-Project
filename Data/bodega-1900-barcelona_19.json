    "We came here for lunch and it was delicious. Reservations are easy to secure here than at their other restaurant Tickets. \u00a0They are right across the street from each other.I think this is a much better lunch place than a dinner place. \u00a0We had the waiter pick our dishes. \u00a0It was much easier this way and everything she brought out was good. \u00a0Place is almost closer to your traditional tapas dishes, but with few different flares you'd expect from Albert Adria.Service here was top notch. \u00a0Very courteous and speaks English pretty well for us non Spanish speakers.",
