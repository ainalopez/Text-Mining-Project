    "After dinner we were on the hunt for a sweet bite and thanks to Yelp we ended up here!Entering the small shop, it was super homey and we were greeted by a super nice gentleman.It was bout an hour before they closed, and there were a few people still there - plus they had plenty of cake left.We went with the cheesecake with raspberry and carrot cake!The carrot cake has a creamy frosting on it unlike any other I've ever tried on carrot cake. It's not cream cheese frosting it's more like a whip cream and cinnamon had a baby. The cake is fluffy, not dense. Amazing! It's a HUGE slice (which photographs VERY well lol) and I couldn't finish it all. I really wish I had saved the rest for later haha.Overall this was a nice sweet ending to our evening. We did get to walk it off a bit as we headed back to the hotel, but the calories were well worth it!",
