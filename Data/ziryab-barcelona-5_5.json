    "Ziryab is a Lebanese wine bar with one of the most interesting and varied menus in Barcelona. It's simply amazing all the way 'round.They have a beautiful wine list, and while the prices per glass (~3-5 euros) are more than common Barca table wine, they're all exceptional. I've tried every red they have and haven't ever come away displeased.The menu is also utterly fantastic. There's a huge list of unusual dips with flatbreads, meat skewers served in hanging towers and Lebanese originals like hot oriental bread balls stuffed with dates and my personal favorite, bacon-wrapped dates that will kill you with delicious flavors.There's no going wrong here.Sidenote: The owners and some of the staff here are deaf, which is why they tend to present the specials board visually rather than verbally. It's another interesting quirk that makes Ziryab all the more memorable.",
