    "We were looking for a quick and casual dinner that wasn't tapas, and were really excited when we stumbled upon Mucci's. Located on a side street off Las Ramblas, Mucci's serves pre-made pizza, empanadas, quiches and delicious fresh-made sangria. They have a nice selection of flavors to choose from and they come out quick after being headed up in the oven. At only $2 per empanada or slice of pizza, the price was right and we got in and out quickly so we could continue exploring the area. I highly recommend the spinach and mozzarella empanada. Very yummy.We also ordered a pitcher of sangria which was made fresh and only cost $8. Not a bad deal! Great spot for a quick bite or full meal. Menus in Spanish and English. Limited seating (about 3-4 tables) but that's typical Barcelona.",
