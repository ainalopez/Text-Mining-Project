    "Great beer and great tapas. Got the Clara which is a pretty light beer (which honestly is just the type of beer I love). In terms of Tapas, you have to order the Steak and Foie Gras.... was probably the best steak I had throughout my trip in Europe and the Foie Gras was cooked perfectly.The chorizo was also a must have, absolutely amazing. Wish I was able to come here more often, my favorite meal in barcelona! and it's pretty close to the beach so you can come out here after a nice swim and tan.",
