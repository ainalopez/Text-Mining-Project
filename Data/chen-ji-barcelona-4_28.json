    "Traveling Europe for 3 weeks made us miss some authentic Chinese food. After reading yelp we went to Chen Ji, all the dishes we ordered were great. The veggie dish is very authentic and the home made noodle is very good as well, which reminds me the good Chinese restaurants at home. It was quite busy during lunch hour, the first floor was full and people sitting upstairs as well. We did not expect Barcelona has such authentic Chinese restaurant and awesome noodle place!",
