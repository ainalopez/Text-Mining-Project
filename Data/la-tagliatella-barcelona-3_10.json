    "Okay, this is Spaghetti Factory done well. I looked for the railroad dining car in the middle of the restaurant; no where to be found. Skeptical when I walked in: no bar that I saw, just dining tables, a smattering of diners, and decorations making the place seem perhaps older, though not worn out.But in the end, yes, I'm a fan.Arrived about 20:00. This may be early by local standards. Was quickly seated. Waiter at table in the blink of an ojo. \u00a0Ordered quickly but without being rushed, watched waitstaff scurrying around. Dinner was on my table quicker than you can say, \"Dov'e 'la mia cena?\"I wondered if I would be eating soggy noodles with greasy pesto. Wrong. Pasta is fresh, not dried, as near as I can tell. I had the pesto tagliatelli. Not perfect the pesto, being ever so slightly dry, but tasty without being overwhelming with oil as some pestos can be.. Tagliatelli was delightful, fresh, al dente, plenty of it--so much I couldn't finish it.First glass of vino, the house red, arrived warm. It must have been sitting around open all day. Flabby mouth feel due to temperature. Didn't give up, second glass arrived evidently taken from cooler storage. Much better. Have no idea what it was and forgot to ask. On the Monterey Coventry Wine scale of \"-, 0, +,\" this house red was a zero--drinkable, average. All grading scales should be this easy and understandable: You don't want it again, you could have it again, you must have it again.And then, just when I thought I was ready to pay the bill and leave, out came the welcomed lemoncello, gratis. Alas, a zero. But that's not bad.Over all, this is good place to have dinner. If here long enough will dine here again.",
