    "Talk about a restaurant being overrated and overpriced! Not worth the wait in my eyes. Yes, the ambiance is fun, the staff seem like funny individuals who were having a good time laughing along while working which was pleasant to witness but the quantity you receive and the quality just aren't worth the price you pay. When the Foie-Burger came out I was shocked at how small the portion was. Effin TINY micro sized one bite per person. Same with the Truffle Ham & Cheese Sandwich. Or the uber hard uber Al-Dente homemade pasta served in a hot skillet. No sauce, just dry yet greasy mass that looks larger in photos. We wanted to order seafood which they were sold out of. They apparently work with fresh fish of the day and do not serve frozen fish which is a positive note but again I'm sure that would've been a single bite serving as well!Sangria was tasty but having had it elsewhere too it just tastes like slightly sweet juice and does not even deliver the weakest buzz. I say skip the 19\u20ac pitcher and go for regular bottle of wine instead. Basically, if I were to return to Barcelona I would avoid dining here again just for the itty bitty teeny weeny micro sized portions and prices that do not match what you're getting.",
