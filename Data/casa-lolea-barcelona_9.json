    "Delicious and delightful lunch. Had interesting dishes like almond cream with mackerel and tomatoes, semolina risotto with truffle oil, etc. Tuna was a tad salty by itself but tastes great with rissoto or bread. Artichoke was so so as a tad too tough. Otherwise everything else was yums and service was great! Had a sangria and meal came up to 29 euros for 2 pax. Good value for money!!!",
