    "Love at first sight. The most crowded place in Barcelona -never take anyone agoraphobic or they'll freak out!- it has the best cava at the cheapest price ever. The real challenge is to find a spot and order, so you'd better ask for the delicious bocadillos and jamon iberico at the same moment. Don't forget to pay right away or the confusion may take you in trouble!",
