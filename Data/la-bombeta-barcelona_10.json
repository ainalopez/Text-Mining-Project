    "Hands down this place BOMB that's why its La Bombeta! BTW the staff barely speaks English and they offer a English menu. However I didn't realize it until we sat down after looking at the menu outside for 10 mins. I can't express how great the food is at this restaurant. It funny we order so much food for 2 people that the waiter had to stop us! We started off with the potatoes balls (appetizer), shrimp with garlicky oil, mussels, tortilla de Bravas, \u00a0 and calms with white wine sauce. And don't forget the sangria! If only I knew this place was this good I would eat there everyday! =)",
