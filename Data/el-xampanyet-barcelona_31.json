    "We stumbled upon this place on our way to the Museu de Picasso. \u00a0A local recommended it and said it was the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. \u00a0The service, without a doubt, was fantastic. \u00a0They were sooo friendly and super helpful in recommending pairings and picking dishes for us based on our culinary preferences.I really liked the cream cheese-stuffed cherry tomato, tuna in oil, and cheesy baked-potato-like tapa. \u00a0Tasty, but overpriced, like all tapas. \u00a0Nothing to write home about. Next!",
