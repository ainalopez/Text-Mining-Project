    "If you like seeing what local places to eat are like instead of the normal tourist places. I highly recommend this place as a go to place. Do not come around 12 in the afternoon because it will be dead. However, the owner/Chef (family run restaurant) who has the best customer service I have ever had. Because he loves tourist to always come by inform me and my cousin to come later reason for the real \"authentic atmosphere of Barcelona\"So we leave to come back an hour later to find a couple families there enjoying the food. We sat outside in the back to enjoy the weather. Little did we know it's mosquito season in Barcelona (October) so in 15 mins we ended up sitting inside. Later to be ordering certain dishes for each course of the meal. (appetizer, main course, dessert, Including drink) all for almost 10 euro. I ordered the egg and rice for appetizer it was kind of a disappointment. But the main dish was what made the food worth it; it was a roasted chicken with potatoes and tomatoes and was so rich tasting it made me want to come back the next day. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to try dessert because I had a ticket to go to the sagrada familia at the time. But overall the chef/owner made it all worth the stay. His humorous ways to relate to tourist and his mannerisms to always keep you happy was the best part. *if you are staying at Sant Jordi close to the church. Definitely go here to enjoy a good time.",
