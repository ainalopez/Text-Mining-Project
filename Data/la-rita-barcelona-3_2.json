    "We were staying at a hotel just a few blocks away and wanted something a little more substantial then tapas. We had walked by earlier in the day and noticed the appealing decor and stopped to check out the menu.After not being able to get reservations for the original restaurant we decided to give LaRita a try. I was very impressed. We were greeted and seated without any delay. The waitress was very friendly and had no issues understanding me, since I don't speak Spanish.I only drink ice tea which is not always easy to find when traveling through out Europe. She brought me a hot tea with a separate glass and ice. Awesome!I started with the hummus and pita bread which I might add was the best hummus that I have ever had. The only suggestion that I would offer is a few more pieces of the bread. It was paired with olives and cheese. Just delicious.My second selection was a field green salad with vegetables. The salad was very typical to what you would expect to get in the states. Although it included roasted corn with the vegetables and it too was delicious.For my entree I selected the aged beef with roasted rosemary potatoes and grilled peppers. The potatoes were very tasty and the beef had a small amount of crusted sea salt that again just pushed this dish over the top. I highly recommend you add LaRita to your list of dinning options when in Barcelona.",
