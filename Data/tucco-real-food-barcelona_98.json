    "We had an incredible experience. Food was very good but the best part was the hospitality. They took their time to explain the menu. They guided us through the order process and made great recommendations. One of the owners came by our table to check on us. He talked with us and offered recommendations for things to see and do while in Barcelona. If ever in Barcelona again we will definitely take the owner up on his offer.",
