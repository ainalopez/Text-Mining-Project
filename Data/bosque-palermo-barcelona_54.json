    "This place came highly recommended by Jason Dinoso, so we decided to give it a try. The seafood paella is like they took a scoop of the ocean, added seasonings and spices, and cooked it. It was like that song from the Little Mermaid, but in my mouth. We also had the carne paella and that was exquisite! Check it out, but make a reservation first.",
