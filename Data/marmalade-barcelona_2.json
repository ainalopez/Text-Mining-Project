    "I definitely loved Marmalade more than Picnic for brunch in Barcelona. \u00a0I loved the ambience, and the dramatic decor. \u00a0Good service. The brie-burger. \u00a0A fat chunk of melted brie on your burger. \u00a0Fantabulous. \u00a0With bacon, caramelized onions. \u00a0Excellent bloody mary. \u00a0You cant go wrong with this joint for brunch.",
