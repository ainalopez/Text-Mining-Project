    "Terrible impolite service. The guy need to chill! I preferred not to eat here and he kind of lost his mind (just for that). Crazies situation ever! Never coming back there. I understand why his place is half empty and the rest of the bars close by are full. If you want to chill and eat good tapas in Barcelona, don't come here.",
