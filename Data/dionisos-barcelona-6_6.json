    "I just added this restaurant to Yelp. It appears to be a chain but this location wasn't listed. It caught our eye as we were walking in the neighborhood near our hotel in the Eixample. The walls are lined, floor to ceiling with bottles of white wine- lit from the bottom. Very striking! Inside the look is very Ikea-ish with lots of blond wood. The menu is greek and they offer a Prix fixe menu for 15 Euros that includes 3 courses with wine. We both started with Lentil Soup, then Mousaka, and finished with different desserts. One was yogurt with honey and the other was Hazelnut ice cream with halvah. It was a great meal for 15 Euros.",
