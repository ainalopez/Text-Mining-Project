    "We stayed around the corner from this brewery during our visit. \u00a0The hotel had 15 EUR breakfast which was very limited. \u00a0We had tapas here one night, and although OK, it is mostly potatoes, sausage, and great beer. \u00a0Kind of like Munich meets Barcelona. \u00a0Where this place really shines is breakfast.Came here two mornings. \u00a0Excellent bread, croissants and eggs. \u00a0Had the poached eggs with bacon and cheese on bread. \u00a0So good! \u00a0While you are here, definitely find an excuse to go downstairs and check out the space. \u00a0Part of the brewery and special function areas, very unique.",
