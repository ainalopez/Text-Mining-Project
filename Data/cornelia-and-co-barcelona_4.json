    "One of my favorite places we've gone to in Barcelona so far, and I'd absolutely recommend it to friends traveling through. Fiver stars for ambience, food, and service. We had the oysters, grilled octopus, prawns tempura, ravioli with beef, and rice with lobster. The octopus may have been the winner there. For dessert we had the puff pastry with strawberries and the lemon meringue. Both were fantastic!",
