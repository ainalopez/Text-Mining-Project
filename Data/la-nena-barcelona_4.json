    "good place for xurros/xocolata. good chocolate, fair prices! the chocolate a la taza comes with a little churro (~2-3 euros) so unless you want to make a meal of it, you don't have to order a plate of churros.cute vibe, but can be a little loud. not a place for a serious conversation but more rather a fun hangout. lots of board games around (i think you can play them) and no alcohol served. they don't have wifi, which is clear by a sign that says to instead talk among yourselves.",
