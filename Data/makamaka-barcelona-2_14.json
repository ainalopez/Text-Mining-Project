    "I was lucky enough to get to attend the opening party of Makamaka... and they threw a hell of a beach party. \u00a0The fries! \u00a0I loved the fries! \u00a0served with a tangy cross between a bbq sauce and a cocktail sauce - just the right amount of salt... i was almost stalking the servers with the trays of fries. \u00a0I would go there just for the fries.But that's not all we sampled... for the party, they had these little burger sliders and i was told they had chicken sliders as well. \u00a0Deeee-lish! \u00a0The staff was friendly, the place was casual, the outdoor area is nicely decorated... I'll definitely return and write an update. \u00a0How did we get the invite? some friends had been coming here every day for a week prior to the party - they loved it that much - so they got the invite... \u00a0they were already hooked.",
