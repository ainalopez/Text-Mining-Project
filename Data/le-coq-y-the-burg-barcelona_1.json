    "Service is friendly and fast. \u00a0The staff gives you a paper menu with a pen and you just check the items you want - easy and efficient. \u00a0The food is good. \u00a0I ordered the chicken tikka burger --it was a bit dry because it was white meat that had been seasoned and ground up into a patty. The toppings were fresh and interesting. \u00a0The French fries seemed fresh as well. \u00a0My two other friends both ordered beef burgers and enjoyed them.",
