    "I must have stopped by here 4 or 5 times when I was in Barcelona. It was literally 5 minutes from my hotel so it was quite convenient to pop in for some pinchos and drinks from time to time. Pinchos are easily one of the greatest food inventions in history. Imagine 20 kinds of apps and mini sanwiches propped up by toothpicks that are ready to eat on the counter. It's glorious! Take what you want, and pay by the number of toothpicks you have left over. It's also very casual, so you can take your time and enjoy the vibe if you want to relax after a day of traveling. Sweet deal.",
