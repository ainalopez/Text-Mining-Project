    "There are no words to express how amazing the food here!Kudos to the chef snd staff who endlessly give their passion in serving good food and tapas with an amazing smile.So let me start my review:1. Ambience : the bar/ restaurant has a very inviting atmosphere, a bit crowded the way the tables were arrange but with all the customers they want to accommodate every one.2. Service: entertaining, fast and adequate. The staff are very attentive with their customer, from asking you what to drink upon sitting down and going back to you and ask what order you want. They give sometimes to explain their menu and give suggestions.3. Price i would say affordable and adequate for the service and food.4. The final moments: Food ---- this one ill leave it to the readers and challenge them to give it a try. My palate describe it as simply amazing!",
