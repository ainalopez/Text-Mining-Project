    "How many times did i eat here over a period of 5 days? 2. Why? Because it is delicious.I wish the states had the concept of pinchos, it is so tasty and you can decide on whatever you want to and as much of it as you wanted. Contrary to other reviews, my lunch with a beer was less than 15 Euros.I love pinchos and this place gets crowded but is much better when you go at American eating times so like noon-ish. Nothing particular stood out, but remember Catalan etiquette when here: get a plate before taking your tooth pick foods and order a drink at the bar if you want one. Then pay at the bar.I want more pinchos in New York.",
