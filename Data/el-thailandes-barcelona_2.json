    "This place is unbelievable. My experience at this restaurant was a complete disaster. The curry was just spicy and had no flavor. Cold rice. They didn't want to honor the check in offer. The goddamn faucet in the bathroom is set on such high pressure that I got drenched with water. I was overcharged... The list goes on. Do yourself a fucking favor and AVOID this place.",
