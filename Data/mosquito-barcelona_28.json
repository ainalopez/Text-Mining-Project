    "Mosquito is such a pleasant surprise! \u00a0Given its location and its niche as an \"asian\" restaurant, I thought it would an overpriced disappointment. \u00a0To the contrary! \u00a0Mosquito has some of the best pan-asian food in town, and at a terrific price point! \u00a0With high ceilings and a surprisingly cozy atmosphere, Mosquito is a bit enchanting!There are many things I love about this restaurant: the atmosphere is casual and friendly. \u00a0The variety of dumplings, salads, and other dishes is astounding. \u00a0Better yet, everything is absolutely delicious! \u00a0The first time I went, we ordered a bunch of different small dishes to share. \u00a0We all liked everything so much that we ordered a second round: fabulous!The wait staff is timely, if not friendly, and for the incredibly low price of this high-quality food, who even cares?I'm certainly not the only one who feels so positively about Mosquito. \u00a0Indeed, on most night's you'll most likely need to wait (especially on the weekend). \u00a0But if you're not in a rush and have an itch for good quality pan-asian cuisine, Mosquito is your spot in Barcelona!",
