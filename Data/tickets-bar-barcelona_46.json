    "I really enjoyed my meal at Tickets, though I would say that the dishes were hit or miss but the hits were extremely memorable and inventive.The decor appears quite festive and circus-like to us Westerners but when we asked, we were told that it was meant to channel a local Spanish festival. We were seated at the bar in the cold food prep area and it was such a treat to see the chefs diligently prepare each dish, a lot of which we were served.You can choose to order a la carte at Tickets or have a selection be chosen for your party. The menu is quite overwhelming so we opted to have the waiter decide but also told him the few dishes we definitely wanted - foie gras, lobster.A lot of the highlights were actually things we didn't choose and a lot of which were such revelations - sangria soaked watermelon (I'm going to add watermelon to all my sangrias from now), the famous liquid olives, a guacamole with seared tuna and cilantro oil.I made a reservation 6 weeks in advance. Set a calendar invite for midnight (Spain time) as the reservation slots go fast!",
