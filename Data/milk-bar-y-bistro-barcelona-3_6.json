    "Came here with a few friends as we were on our way to dinner somewhere else, but far too early. We tried out some of their cocktails as we saw a great 2 for 1 cocktail special (definitely recommend!) and decided to share a ramen burger and fries. The 2 for 1 cocktail deal (through yelp) was pretty great, though the cocktails were limited. I'd definitely recommend going there for drinks and a bite to eat, though. Their cajun fries were also phenomenal. The ramen burger was a bit of a let down-- the ramen burger was pretty soft and chewy, and was a bit of a let down. Everything else was good and we weren't really there with the goal to eat, so we had a good time. However, all of us agreed we wouldn't eat their ramen burger again. I'll be going to Japan in a few months; I'm keen to see what a Japanese ramen burger is like and compare. Maybe we all just don't like ramen burgers, who knows! Regardless, this place is perfect if you want affordable cocktails and fries.",
