    "Too OVERRATED!!! I came here after the Picasso museum visit as it was just down the block and highly rated in Yelp. \u00a0But I was largely disappointed! \u00a0 The anchovies were VERY salty and fishy, not fresh at all. \u00a0 The seafood plate for one qas very very small portion. \u00a0The seafood tasted like they were from a can and probably were because Catalans like seafood from can. \u00a0I didn't mind as long as they were good but they were not! \u00a0Did I mentioned it was tiny? \u00a0The beef with green peppers were tough and the beef was completely cooked through unlike some reviews I saw with it cooked medium. \u00a0That was the reason I ordered it thinking it'd be medium or medium rare but apparently they were inconsistent. \u00a0At 19 euros for fully done beef was way overpriced! \u00a0The house cava (sparkling white wine) was overrated. \u00a0The ONLY good dish was the grilled calamari which was fresh and the simply garlic olive oil parsley sauce gave it a lot of flavors. \u00a0The calamari was the only reason I gave this place 3 star instead of 2!!!",
