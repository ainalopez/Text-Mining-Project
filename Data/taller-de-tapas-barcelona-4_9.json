    "Taller de Tapas was recommended by our hotel concierge, and we had a great meal from beginning to end. The server's name was Andrea. She spoke a little English, and I spoke a little Spanish, so we got along great. We went with the prix fixe menu of the day which included a few different tapas dishes, sangria, and dessert. The cider chorizos were phenomenal, and I've unsuccessfully tried to replicate the spicy mayo from the potatoes bravas several times now. So good.The prices were reasonable. The only complaint I have is that the tables were very close to each other. I felt like I was intruding on my neighbors' conversations every time I opened my mouth.On our way out, the manager asked us to check his English on the menu out front. I thought it was nice of him to care about the non-Spanish speakers.Thank you for making my first meal in Barcelona a memorable one!",
