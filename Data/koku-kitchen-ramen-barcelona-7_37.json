    "We took a little bike tour today on our second day in Barcelona to get the lay of the land and thankfully just at the end of the tour we passed by Koku Kitchen. We had had amazing tapas last night but we were in the mood for something else this afternoon. We headed straight back to Koku Kitchen and were delighted by the guys running the place and the food we ate. 4 different choices of ramen with a few optional add-ons, a nice beverage menu and a selection of desserts that we will definitely try the next time there. And yes, we will definitely go back this trip and we will bring friends!",
