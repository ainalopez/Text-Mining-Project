    "4 stars for just one menu item, 3.5 stars overall for action, ambience, wifi & clean washrooms. \u00a0 is it worth waiting for 30 min? nah, I eat this type of breakfast all the time, it's part of my job lol. \u00a0 but seriously, when you're on vacation, who wants to wait for an hour? and heard ppl gave up after 35min or so.luckily, others waited in line while I window shopped this gorgeous dessert place a block away, more on that later, lets digress as usual.that submarine sanwich with avocado, and whatever that meat & incredible sauce: that I have never tasted anything like it. \u00a0 great portion too.but the eggs benedicts, smoothies, pancake ricotta: good but not rolling your eyes. \u00a0 awesome display of fruits though.got the very front bench seating facing the crowds, watching you eat, kinda hilarious if you strive for that attention.",
