    "oh boy, boy oh boy, did i got my stomach full! Visiting Barcelona means eating local food. Tapas like patatas bravas or croquettes are pretty good choice, but who doesn't want to eat fresh seafood in reasinable prices? And by fresh I mean alive, because if u walk in La Paradeta u feel like u are at La Rambla (seafood laying on the counter). If u want u can have octopus, tiger prawns, navallajas, clams, chipirones etc (fried grilled or in 2 choices of sauce). U can order them from 100g to infinity I guess. Wines are pretty cheap (the cheapest about 6-7 euro per bottle). \u00a0Eat like a king and pay like u are in a supermarket!",
