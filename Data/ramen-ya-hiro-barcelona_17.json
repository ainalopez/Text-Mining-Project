    "This is a really good bowl. And for Spain it's great to see some diversity and a real appreciation for good food from other parts of the globe. The only thing I could really fault Hiro on are the noodles. While well cooked, the texture just isn't right. Maybe they are using frozen noodles, or just need to work on the recipe.Ramen nerd complaints aside, this is a perfectly good place and one I'm going to keep visiting when in town. If you like ramen and need a noodle fix this a great place. Eat here......Ps. To put Hiro in context of other cities for the real ramen fans... I give it a strong 3/5 for Europe, as I think it's reasonable to hold Barcelona to the same culinary standard of cities like London and Paris (mainly because this is a city that appreciates good food). For Japan (Tokyo, specifically as one Yelper said) I can only give it a 2 or 3. It's good, but to compare it to the ramen capital of the world and give it a 4/5 is a stretch.",
