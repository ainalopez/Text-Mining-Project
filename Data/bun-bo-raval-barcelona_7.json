    "Absolutely fantastic. Great atmosphere, wonderful cocktails and lovely decor.Had cocktails here before (cheapest for quality that I've found in barcelona) and tried the food.Steak I had was fantastic and the traditional yet delicious Vietnamese dessert of cookies, ice cream and coffee was brilliant. Great value Too as all mains less than 10euros including the steak dish. Definitely visit. Staff could be a bit politer but I'll forgive that as the place is rammed.",
