    "I was in Spain with 4 of my buddies last summer, and Tapa Tapa became our favorite spot for the week. We met this awesome bartender named Rahil who was just the coolest guy ever. We came here three times in three days, and each time Rahil comp'ed us drinks and tapas! Make sure you sit at the bar where the tax is cheaper than sitting at a table or outside (yes sitting outside is more expensive). Some creative little tapas, I don't remember exactly what we ate, but all very tasty. It is a little touristy, but try to interact with the locals and definitely ask for Rahil! -Joseph",
