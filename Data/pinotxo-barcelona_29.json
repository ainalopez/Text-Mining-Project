    "This is one of the few places that open early in the morning. The older man working here recommended beef stew and it was good. A bottle of white wine was only 3 euros and it's self serve. I didn't mind drinking cheap sweet wine in the morning haha only on vacation. I was hoping they were serving seafood but it was too early. Seating here is very limited and many people like to eat here.",
