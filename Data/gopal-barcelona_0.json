    "I'm currently traveling through countries, and for the first time in two weeks I've had really good vegan food. Everything in this restaurant looks delicious, the fries are made like the animal style fries from, in and out -- the California chain - it was so delicious. Here's an update to the reviewWe came in again today, different staff, just as friendly as the previous staff. Tried a different burger and bought every dessert ever. I love this place, I wish I had it in California.",
