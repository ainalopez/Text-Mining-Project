    "These are the most well done pintxos I had in Barcelona (granted I didn't go anywhere truly upscale). The price is right at 1 euro each. The drinks are nice and cheap - we had white bubbly sangria the one night. I would highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Barcelona for a casual dining option.",
