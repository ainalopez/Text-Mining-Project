    "Incredible little find in Barcelona with a beautifully decorated restaurant and wonderfully attentive service. We ordered 3 tapas, 1 pepita, and a dessert between the 2 of us along with some house sangria (delicious btw). \u00a0The beef carpaccio and the spinach salad were our favorite tapas along with the golden pepita. \u00a0Hands down this was some of the best food that we had in Barcelona. \u00a0We got there around 8pm and were able to sit near the bar area. \u00a0Probably good to get there early since it fills up quickly.",
