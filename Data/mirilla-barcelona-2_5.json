    "a hidden jam with great food and ambiance. the prices are affordable and they offer a good array of tapas. we came as a group so we shared a lot of dishes including the \u00a0which was good and meatballs -- also tasty. some dishes were a swing and a miss such as the salad but overall great experience and recommended",
