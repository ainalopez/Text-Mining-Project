    "So glad we made this part of our trip to Barcelona. Super fresh ingredients - straight from the Boqueria - and perfect Old World charm. Seafood, meat, vegetables, everything is classic Catalonian. The service is impeccable and everyone is passionate about what they're doing. Say hi to the namesake of the restaurant, Isidre Giron\u00e9s - you can't miss him. He's a local legend. Isidre was also kind enough to refer us to a friend who makes tapas at the Boqueria. He took good care of us.Great wine program. I really hope I can eat here again someday.",
