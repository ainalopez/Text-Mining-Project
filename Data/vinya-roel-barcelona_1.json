    "This was the fanciest place we went to on our trip to Barcelona on a recommendation from a friend.We must have been really early or eaten on a boycott day because at 630pm we were the only ones there.That didn't help the ambiance or feel of the place but it did make it feel special. Like the restaurant was closed to others and we were the special guest diners.It's not a small place either.It's nice inside with exposed brick walls and a lot of glass around giving it a modern/contemporary feel (apologies to any designers reading this if the impression is incorrect) which was to my liking.Presumably to pay for this look, the menu is suitably priced.This is no fast food chain and it's pricey compared to our usual eats when on vacation in a foreign country.That being said, the food was excellent. The cold meat plate was better than I expected, have to remember portion sizes are normal in the rest of the world.The cod was also warm, soft and flaky melt in the mouth type which is exactly how it should be.If we had unlimited funds, it would be nice to try out all the dishes.Without, it's a 1 time deal for us.",
