    "El Laurel was my favorite meal in Barcelona. It was frequented mostly by locals, felt relaxing and homey, and the service was charming. The place was also very unique with art for sale on its walls. Most of all, the food was excellent. Order 3-6 expanadas between two people and eat a main dish. Excellent place! Glad I found this place on my last night in the area.",
