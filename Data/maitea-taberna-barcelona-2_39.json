    "Yes, try this place! I believe there is something waiting on the menu for each person who comes here. For me, the apple tart with cinnamon ice cream dessert was to die for. Coupled with a glass of Moscatel, I was in heaven. I loved the Moscatel so much, I immediately found the source retail store and bought a bottle to bring back to the States.Take a look at the framed lace in the back room--superb needlework, and created by family members!This place was hard to find. Its address (157) was not across the street from the even numbers in the same sequence. You had to go way up the street to find 157. Hang in there--it's worth it!",
