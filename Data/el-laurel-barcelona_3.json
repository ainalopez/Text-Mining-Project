    "We stumbled upon this hole in the wall a few years ago while on vacation in Barcelona only to discover a menu with an amazing assortment of empanadas with a creative combinations of flavors and ingredients. \u00a0We ended up trying almost every one on the menu and they were all amazing. \u00a0Every time I've been back I've visited El Laurel and the food and service is always spot on. With so many hole in the wall spots it can be hard to find a diamond in the rough but this is truly one of them. \u00a0Great place for lunch, a late night snack or a low key dinner.",
