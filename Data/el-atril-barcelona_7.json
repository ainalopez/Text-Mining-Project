    "We went to El Atril two times for lunch during our 5 day stay in Barcelona. We liked it because it's outdoors, they have a pretty extensive menu, live music playing intermittently (nothing obnoxious) and it's in a great location in El Born.Here are our reviews of what we had over the course of our two visits:(1) Cheese plate: very good, especially for the price!(2) Tomato bread: decent, not the best(3) Shishito peppers: very good!(4) Iberian Jamon: it was okay; a little fatty for my taste(5) Iberian Jamon on toast: much better, would recommend this over the plate of jamon(6) House salad: this was OK; the tomatoes in it were very big and not cut into bite size pieces and kind of grossed me outMy boyfriend had sangria, which was decent, my wine was not great, but drinkable.I think the first time we went, it was only our first true day in Spain, so without having much to compare it to, I felt it was very good. After returning on our last day in Spain, I was not as pleased, but would still recommend it.I'd say go for Sunday brunch, or lunch, get drinks, cheese and the shishito peppers!",
