    "I've been here in the afternoon and at night. \u00a0It's a lot of fun and a great environment. \u00a0The outside seating is awesome as the square has a lot of potential, but expect a healthy wait at all times of the day! \u00a0Their burgers are fantastic, and we love the Patatas Fritas with Rosemary, but sadly they were out the last time we visited. \u00a0It did, and usually does, take awhile to get service... they seem to be perpetually understaffed. \u00a0The servers and bartenders are all great and quirky which adds to the ambience. \u00a0I definitely recommend it. \u00a0Cash only!",
