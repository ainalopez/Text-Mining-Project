    "It's safe to say that La Champa\u00f1er\u00eda just wasn't our scene.Walking in late on a Saturday afternoon, this lively dive bar was packed like a can of sardines. We ordered our glasses of cava, tried to find a spot to settle in, and took a look around - tourists and locals alike telling stories, laughing, eating bacon sandwiches and enjoying some serious daytime drinking.It took exactly 3 minutes for the guy next to me to spill half of my cava down my shirt as he went to put his arm around his girlfriend. It's a tight space, so you really can't be surprised by the battle wounds which will soon be inflicted.Two more spills from 2 different parties later, we headed toward the door to find something a bit more relaxed. Th truth is, cava is relatively inexpensive (2-3\u20ac) throughout Barcelona so La Champa\u00f1er\u00eda isn't the end-all, be-all for cheap boozing. And anyway, I think that cava tastes better sitting down! Just my two cents.",
