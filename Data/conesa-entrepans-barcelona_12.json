    "This place has DELICIOUS sandwiches at a GREAT price. While Bo de B is the go-to spot for picking your own ingredients in a bocadillo, Conesa is the place to go for order-off-the-menu bocadillos! these sandwiches are delicious & at right around 3-4\u20ac you really can't go wrong just picking a random one to try out, although I highly recommend the \"lomo y queso\" (pork & cheese) bocadillo! This place can get pretty crowded inside so I suggest getting your food & then walking directly diagonal across the pla\u00e7a & sitting on one of the benches in the next pla\u00e7a! only real drawback to this spot is its touristy location so it can be a bit of a wait to get a sandwich during peak hours!",
