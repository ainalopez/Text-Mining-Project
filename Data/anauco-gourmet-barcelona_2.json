    "They said the magical words!!! \"How do you like your meat?\". This is the difference between a burger joint an a gourmet burger in a gastro bar. The place is located one square south of Sagrada Familia and there is plenty of space, also for groups. I went there for the Burger event held by Yelp this month and we were 11. Service was kind and helpful, we ordered some snacks and after we got the burger. I ordered the Anauco from a list that contained several beef burger, chicken, shellfish and veggy. It has arugula, goat cheese, and spicy bell pepper sauce. The bun was fresh and the meat really really tender. Next time though I will ordered it medium, and not medium rare. And the fries were excellent. All together I will say one of the best burgers I have tried in Barcelona. Price is also more that fair.EDIT: I went today with my wife and tasted the traditional burger. It was lustfully juicy and tasty. This has become in a week my burger place of preference",
