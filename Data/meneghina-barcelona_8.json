    "Dine here if you need a break from tapas!The food was delicious and fresh - 4 stars. What we orderedBeef carpaccio - the beef was fresh and thinly cut, cheese was flavorful, dressing & arugula were also fresh and tasty. It was the best carpaccio we had on this Europe trip considering we ordered it 3 times in Paris and once in Nice.Linguini with shrimp - pasta was al dente and infused with garlic and seafood flavor, shrimp was fresh, and tomatoes and arugula were also really fresh from her garden.Stuffed squid - fresh seafood, well balanced carmelized onion & garlic filling, also accompanied with the home grown tomatoes and arugula.The service and hospitality was 5 stars. The owner verbally translated the ENTIRE menu in English. We didn't order wine with our meal but she gave us complimentary wine because she thought it would accentuate our meal, which it did! We could tell she really wanted us to be comfortable and just enjoy our meal.Ambience - 5 starsCozy and warm hospitality (maybe because the owner is from Sicily) and artfully decorated. It was very relaxing and felt like we were in someone's home.I definitely recommend this cute little restaurant!",
