    "Besides the already mentioned Hotel Banys Oriental, I am also in favour for the attached Restaurant Senyor Parellada. Fantastic Food, focussing on catalan aspects and avoiding molecular trends. The quality of the ingredients and sophisticated combinations is what this restaurant stands for. They have so called evergreens on the menu, which are served since the 90ties and are very excellent. I am always amazed about the low prices for excellent wine in this restaurant. Pricing for the food is considering the quality, the excellent services and the famous ambiance also surprising. Reservations need to be done quite early, but as a hotel guest you will probably always get a table.",
