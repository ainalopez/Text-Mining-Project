    "Of all the visions, fantasies and expectations I had of dining during my trip to Barcelona, La Vinya del Senyor met or surpassed each and every one. We just happened upon this teensy little tapas bar during a late night stroll through Barrio Gotico, just as we exited a narrow, stone-paved street into the square near Santa Maria del Mar, one of the most impressive (and oldest) Gothic Cathedrals I have ever seen. There were several tables outside, but we went in and sat at the bar, where an extremely kind young woman helped us select a cava (go for rosado - a very interesting rose variety of cava) and a trio of tapas to compliment it. The jamon ibrico was the best I had during my 10 days in Barcelona, no doubt. It was sliced so thinly, the delicate marbling throughout the pork actually melted in my mouth, and the flavor was that beautifully grassy, earthy, pure deliciousness that can only come from perfectly-cured and cut jamon ibirico. With the jamon, we had a sampling of Catalonian cheeses, all of which were superb - one creamy like a brie, one tangy and firm like an aged goats cheese, and one slightly moldy sheep's milk cheese, similar to Humboldt Fog. WIth that, we also got a generous bowl of mixed olives - super-flavorful, tender and juicy. We stayed at that bar for hours, savoring our Catalonian treats and chatting with the bar maid. There was no rushing, no crowding, no hovering. The cozy space was very intimate, and I could tell it was just as old as the city around it. I loved it, and can quite confidently say that this was my favorite tapas spot in Barcelona, hands down. Not to be missed!",
