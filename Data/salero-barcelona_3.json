    "White hotFrom the entrance, Salero looks as though it's going to be pretentious and intimidating. Fortunately, it's neither, just a great place to have a drink in amazing surroundings. Decor is cool minimalist white, glass and steel, music is loungey hip hop and cocktails are potent. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a table for dinner on our last visit, but I'll definitely be booking next time.",
