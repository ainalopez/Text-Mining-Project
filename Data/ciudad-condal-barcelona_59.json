    "I came here for early brunch and again for early dinner. \u00a0Both times phenomenal food. \u00a0Love the cuttlefish, cod, razor clam and fried green pepper. \u00a0The key to beat the crowd was to go eat earlier than everybody else, meaning at 10:30am and 6:30am. \u00a0 No wait at all. \u00a0All their seafood dishes were well prepared except for the fried anchovies which was a tad fishy. \u00a0Love this place as much as its sister restaurant just blocks down.",
