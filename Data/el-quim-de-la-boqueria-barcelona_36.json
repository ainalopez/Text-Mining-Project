    "First of all, it is absolutely, extremely pure luck if you can find a seat in this bar. This is 3/4 of a square sized bar with less than 30 chairs and it is always packed! Fortunately for us, we were extremely lucky to find three chairs and there were four of us so my husband took the hit and spent our whole meal standing up. But the food was so amazing he absolutely did not mind at all. The servers work behind the bar and even though they are extremely busy they are very attentive. We got our drinks right away which by the way you can never go wrong with a glass of whatever red wine they have. The food is tapas style so we asked for some recommendations because even though we know spanish we did not know what 3/4 of the menu said. The server recommended the \"huevos con chipirones\" which are tiny weird squids with two fried eggs on top. Odd, right? OMG, I could have eaten two plates of this all by myself. This was one of the best meals from our whole trip. We also ordered baked cod, gambas al ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce), patatas bravas, octopus, and crema catalana (creme brulee). Aboslutely everything was outstanding specially the shrimp and creme brulee. Even though there were a lot of people giving us the eye and waiting for us to leave to take our chairs (which by the way we did it too), we never felt rushed by the servers. We even met Quim and he was very nice to us and asked us about our meal.This place was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.",
