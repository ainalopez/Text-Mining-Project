    "A nice little place for a quick meal but, in spite of what you may have read elsewhere, this restaurant is very far from anything you will find in New Your City. The food is average at best and with a distinct Mediterranean taste. The house burger comes with a red sauce, bacon and onions. The flavor is distinctly mediterranean. The Mac & Cheese was just OK. A side dish with a bit too much cheese for my taste. The noodles were slightly undercooked. When we arrived, we found a small dish of salty nuts on the table. The room's decor leaves a lot to be desired. Service was prompt and friendly. So, New York it is not... But an OK meal in the middle of town. Don't ask for tap water though. \"free water\" is not served. A bit expensive - $27 for two burgers, one Mac & Cheese and one very sweet ice tea. Enjoy.",
