    "We went to Teresa Carles on several occasions for TAKE OUT. \u00a0They have the BEST juices. \u00a0I particularly like the \"anti-ox\" which is kiwi, lemon, strawberry, & one other thing. \u00a0Their \"detox\" beet/celery one is good too, especially after drinking a lot & eating lots o' meat.We went once for dinner too and it did not disappoint. \u00a0The gazpacho was particularly tasty - it had a hint of mint - \u00a0and so was the avocado/tofu starter. \u00a0Their salads are nice & huge, though I'd tell them to lay off the dressing a bit on the Caesar. \u00a0I like that you can make your own salad. \u00a0Presentation was also top-notch.All in all, TC is a great place to go for a break from all the meat tapas so you can get some salads & vegetables & fruits (I'm from the Bay Area where we live & die by fresh produce)! \u00a0Don't forget to get the juices!",
