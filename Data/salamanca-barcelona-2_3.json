    "Probably a tourist trap but a really fun tourist trap that's really great for large groups. We shared a hit or miss seafood platter and some pretty tasty paella. They also gave us a ton of random free booze (mostly digestifs) and the staff was fun to joke around with. Plus you're eating on the beach. It's worth going for the experience, if not for the food.",
