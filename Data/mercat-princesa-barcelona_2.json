    "This place was GREAT when it first opened. I mean fantastic. It was always packed with locals and the food was amazing. I took some visitors there last week and was shocked to find the place virtually empty (I've NEVER seen it even half empty) and 1/3 of the stations just gone. The worst, however, was that not only had the prices risen, but the food quality had been substantially lowered (7 Euros for 4 pieces of dried out sushi roll!!) . I mean it was garbage. We chatted with the bartender and found out it had recently been sold and the service \"revised\" so that portions were smaller and choices were fewer. WTF? People loved this place before, it was fun and lively and the food was great. Now, the patatas bravas that used to be amazing I swear were fried frozen potato wedges that were mushy and tasteless. I did have a couple of decent salads but everything else was either not available (no more Thai food, no oyster bar, no mini burgers) or totally unappetizing. I took my friends there to impress them and unfortunately will not be returning - ever.",
