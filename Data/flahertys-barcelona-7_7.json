    "Wonderful staff, and in Barca, that's hard to find!Here's the dilema we had: We work from our computers, anywhere in the world. We decided to spend 3 months in Barcelona, living & working. But we didn't want to spend all our time in our apartment. So I searched out restaurants/cafes that had free wifi and plug outlets that we could use. In the US, this is a very common resource. But in Barcelona, they're few and far between. \u00a0This Irish Pub had free wifi, outlets to plug in our computers, great and super friendly staff and wonderful food!! It was a serious gem!So, if you're in Barcelona, looking for a co-working space, go here!! It was just what we needed. \u00a0The food is all very good too! I had the fried chicken salad and my friend had the ribs, both amazing. Especially for an Irish Pub in Spain.",
