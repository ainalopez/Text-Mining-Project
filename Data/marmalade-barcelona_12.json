    "I'm a huge fan. Went to Marmalade for a friend's birthday dinner and had the Wild West burger, which was fantastic, and a strawberry daiquiri, which went straight to my head (I have the alcohol tolerance of a hamster) but was delicious nonetheless. They also home-make their own ketchup, which is a little spicier than regular ketchup - so great! Four of my friends ordered the Yoga Man (a veggie burger complete with cucumber yogurt) and raved about it. Actually, everyone who had a burger loved it. Prices were all reasonable - from what I remember from the rest of the menu, all of the burger entrees are under 10 euros, and the drinks are anywhere between 5 and 7ish. We also ordered a slice of apple pie for the birthday girl, and they brought it out with candles and everything.Ambience is really nice, a kind of funky divey restaurant. It's a little dark, though, so I wasn't able to take as many pictures as I would have liked (although the food more than made up for that). All of my friends and I agreed that we'd be back before we left Barcelona - perhaps for their brunch next time, which is supposed to be great - although I'll miss the burgers!",
