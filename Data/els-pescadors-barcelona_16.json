    "We stumbled on this restaurant because of \u00a0our wonderful book called 100% Barcelona, which gives you great tips on where the locals eat. My Dutchman was determined to find this restaurant after reading so many great reviews. The fact that we were hungry, tired and walking on foot to find this restaurant did not stop us from making the trip. Our sole objective was to enjoy some of the freshest seafood in Barcelona.This is the type of restaurant that you will not find so easily, so I would suggest making reservations first and then jumping into a taxi to head right over to Els Pescadors to enjoy a delicious meal. It's known for \u00a0the best seafood in Barcelona. We were fortunate to dine outside on the terrace, so we could enjoy the amazing weather at night! It was a pleasurable experience to eat here.",
