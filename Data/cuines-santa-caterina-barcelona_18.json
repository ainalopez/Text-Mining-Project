    "I have been here on two separate visits to Barcelona, and each time it is one of my favorite food experiences of the year. The menu is diverse with offerings from Spain and Catalan, the Mediterranean, Italy and Asian cuisine. It's a great place to come with a family or group who have varieties of tastes. The food also is easily shared with most served in large portions. It always is difficult to choose, but this time I chose my two favorites: the paella with chicken and sausage, served generously in a large skillet, and the gambones shrimp served in garlic butter. The wine choices also are reasonable and perfectly Spanish.No visit to Barcelona is complete without sampling the cuisine here. Don't miss it, and you'll have a memorable experience of food and beautiful aesthetics.",
