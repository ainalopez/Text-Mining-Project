    "This is a nice place to go for a quick bite. I went with a vegetarian friend who picked out a pre-prepared salad with lettuce, mango, cheese and a dressing that she really enjoyed (6\u20ac). I got the supercarnes burrito (about 8\u20ac) which I liked a lot. There were also a bunch of bottled drinks, and we picked out the horchata to share (2\u20ac).This place is similar to a chipotle, but not the same format. The burritos and tacos are predesigned, so you can't really create a burrito for scratch yourself. But there are still a lot of options, just trust the flavors and combinations are there.",
