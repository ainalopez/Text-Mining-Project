    "Asian fusion as well as traditional tapas at very reasonable prices. Sensi has an intimate atmosphere with dark wood interior, English speaking staff as well as English menus.Reservations are a must, even mid week. Food is fresh, tasty and of high quality. There wasn't a single item we tasted that wasn't at least 4.5 stars. These are some of the must-haves:House red winePotatoes with spicy brava sauceCherry tomato and French brie salad with onion marmalade on toasted breadSeafood paellaHomemade ravioli with parmesan cream sauce and truffle oilAsian seared tuna skewers",
