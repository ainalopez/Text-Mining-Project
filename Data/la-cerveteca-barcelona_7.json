    "I get tired of drinking the same watery, mass produced beer on vacation. So I was rather pleased when I stumbled upon this place. The beer I had was great. I just went with one of the house beers on tap, but everyone else was grabbing bottles off the shelf.I had horse meat chorizos. It sounded dangerous, but it was a good pick.My only knock on the place was its overwhelming selection with little guidance. Yes, they were friendly staff, but no I can't describe my perfect level off hoppiness in Spanish. So I ended up just choosing randomly.",
