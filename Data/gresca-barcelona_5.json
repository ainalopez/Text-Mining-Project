    "What a magnificent restaurant. The cooking is creative and proficient. Udon noodles made of pork belly??? Count me in. Forever and ever. Their lunch deal looked great but I still got the long 8 course tasting menu which lasted a bit more than 2 hours. Personally the dishes from the tasting menu that also appeared on the lunch menu tasted the best, which I guess can be attributed to fresh ingredients, so I suggest you try the lunch menu if you are unsure about the tasting. But come here by all means!",
