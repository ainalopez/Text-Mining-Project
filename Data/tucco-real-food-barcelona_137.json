    "So I read the reviews and thought this place must be good with all the 5 star reviews. Well I wasn't prepared for how absolutely amazing it was. Firstly we were greeted by a lovely lady upon entering, she proceeded to explain every dish on the menu. She was so nice and enthusiastic that I immediately loved the place. I was with my husband and four year old son. We placed our order, spaghetti bolognes for my son, eggplant parmigiana for my husband and some yummy special ravioli for me which was to die for!!! The flavors were so rich, all the pasta is homemade, every bite was delicious. Our waiter Lucas was so nice. I have been in the service industry for 20 years and he is one of the best. I cannot state how much I love this place. My favorite meal and service in Barcelona, an absolute must!!!",
