    "After a week of tapas in Barcelona, I was looking for something different and craved pizza and my sister wanted to go to Fabians. \u00a0Fabian is a former boxer who opened a pizza restaurant with great results. \u00a0The restaurant is small and simple, just what you want from a pizza place.The tomato tartare is outstanding and a perfect way to start a meal. \u00a0Even if I had nothing else there, I would recommend this restaurant based on that appetizer alone.But the pizza is excellent as well. \u00a0The crust is not too thick and not too thin. \u00a0It is also has the right chewiness for my tastes. \u00a0I had the pepperoni pizza and my wife had a margarita pizza both of which were outstanding.Fabian even came by our table and chatted with us for a while. \u00a0We found out he got into pizza making because after a 48 bout boxing career in which he lost 47 times, he knew boxing was not his future. \u00a0That is good news for pizza lovers who when traveling in Barcelona want a good pizza.",
