    "Absolutely fantastic! We came in a multi-national group of 11 and were treated with the best ever service and food (we had the fresh sea bass, John Dory, Entercote (steak), most of the starters and dessert. Everything was great and everyone agreed. Our server, Beltran, was one of the most professional, efficient and enjoyable waiters with perfect timing and etiquette. FIVE stars! We highly recommend Els Pescadors.",
