    "The food and service here is absolutely amazing. Came here for Christmas Day dinner and do not regret the decision to visit. Amazing cocktails, wine, appetizers, and entrees. The servers are happy to speak Spanish or English to customers, which is nice. Would highly recommend anyone to visit while stopping over in old Barcelona. My mouth died and went to heaven with each course.",
