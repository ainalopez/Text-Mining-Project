    "I was lucky enough to enjoy dinner here in New Year's Eve. The food was amazing, by far the best food we had in Barcelona. Everything was so fresh, and flavourful. I had a delicious dish with green pesto and beans, and some amazing sun dried tomatoes. The main was a spinach and ricotta cannelloni. The food was great and the service was lovely. I would highly recommend it.",
