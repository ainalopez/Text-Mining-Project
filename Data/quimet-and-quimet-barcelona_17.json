    "Believe the hype! \u00a0Quimet & Quimet was my favorite meal in Barcelona and the only place where I went twice during my recent vacation. \u00a0We arrived 30 minutes before opening just in case the line was crazy and ended up being the first ones in line. \u00a0By the time they opened, the line was maybe 15 people and it only got more crowded as the night went along.The ordering system is not for the timid and a bit of a shock the first time around. \u00a0It really is like a bar you would find at a packed club except instead of drinks you are ordering amazing tapas. \u00a0If you are lucky you can snatch a spot at the counter and once you have your counter spot it's yours until you are done with your meal. \u00a0So no shoving allowed. \u00a0If you can't get a counter spot, you can try to grab a spot at one of the tables in the back. \u00a0It's standing room only. \u00a0They have some sort of crazy system to keep track of your orders and it's based on where you are standing so don't move around. \u00a0I was surprised how accurate our bill was considering we ordered a dozen plates or so. \u00a0To order, you just have to make eye contact with them and tell them what you want. \u00a0Each tapa is made in about a minute.Literally everything we tried was good but there were a few standouts.-Razor clams with oil-Foie-gras with volcanic salt-Salmon with yogurt and truffled honey-MusselsJust an amazing meal and one of my favorite restaurants ever!",
