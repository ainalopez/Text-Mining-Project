    "Came in with 3 friends to satisfy our Korean food craving.The goods: My friend and I ordered the seafood pancake which was deliciously crispy and full of seafood. It was very filling. I think I could have eaten one alone and been full. We also ordered the blood sausage stew. I would not recommend, which is recommended since Korean style blood sausage isn't a common delicacy and must be frozen to be brought here or something. The sausages were small and a bit shriveled, like they'd be sitting in the fridge awaiting their demise.My other friend got the kimchi stew, which was standard. Not for vegetarians, contains bits of meat from the meat broth. She didn't know and had to pick them out. Just fyi in case you happen to be a vegetarian eyeing the kimchi stew.The other friend got the mixed rice with veggies and egg. Normally comes with ground beef but she's also vegetarian and asked for it to be taken out. It tasted standard, nothing crazy!Good portions.The ambiance: Clean, with Korean decor, well-lit. The downstairs is reserved for drink-only customers while the second floor is reserved for dining customers.The service: The lady was sweet and the other non-Korean worker was pretty cool too.Would I come back? Probably, but after I try some other Korean joints and compare. It was a little pricey, but I'm comparing it with Los Angeles Korean food pricing haha. It's worth it though if you have a craving to satisfy.",
