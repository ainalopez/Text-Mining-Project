    "I was positively surprised by the quality and execution of the dishes at this \u00a0establishment. \u00a0We had sauteed mussels, amazing iberian ham with tomato rubbed toast, grilled sardines, beef with a foie gras topping, a cheese plate and several other dishes which we shared. \u00a0None of the dishes was a disappointment. \u00a0My only strike against the place was the wine list, which could have been more extensive - but this is a minor nit. \u00a0Pricing was entirely reasonable with no courses over 20 euros. \u00a0Lastly, this restaurant passed the \"smile test\".... everyone at every table positively looked happy - a key metric when judging how good a restaurant really is. \u00a0I would recommend Igueldo for an excellent, foodie meal for people who like to experiment. \u00a0Overall, a very, very good meal.",
