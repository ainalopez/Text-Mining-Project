    "We have spent a couple of weeks in Barcelona with relatives - they have steered us here several times and we really like it. The food isn't fancy but very good and the atmosphere makes you feel like a regular. If you want to hang out at a long established local place, eat some good food and enjoy some soccer on tv, this is your place.",
