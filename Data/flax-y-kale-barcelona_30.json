    "The ambience and food deserve a solid 5 stars, but the service was a bit lacking, hence the 4 star review. Everything here is organic and super fresh, which is extra refreshing when traveling. Order the avocado toast--you won't regret it. I'm still dreaming of it two days later. The fruit salad is not what you'd expect, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's a platter of deliciously fresh fruit ranging from cherries to perfectly ripe strawberries, bananas and orange slices. Delicious. They offer wheat grass shots made to order, but at $4, they could give you a little more. The server finally came by to take our order (slow even for European standards), and we never saw him again. We finally had to walk up to the counter to pay, and the bartender wasn't very happy about that. Go for the food!!!",
