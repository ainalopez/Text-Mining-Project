    "Outstanding restaurant and experience. The entire staff was friendly and inviting. They took considerable care in making every aspect of the meal perfect. It's clear that the chef loves food and wants to share that with his customers. We were greeted by him and he also followed up during the meal. We all ordered the fixed course menu, which had an exceptional price/quality ratio. The chicken and flank steaks were perfectly seared and flavored. I didn't even know I liked sangria until having it here. I guess you shouldn't say you don't like something until you've had the best version of it. Everything was wonderful. The only bad part was saying goodbye to my empty dessert plate.",
