    "4 stars for ambiance, 4 for food flavor, 2 for portions, 1 for service and 1 for value.I decided to walk down a small alley and found this place. \u00a0I was enchanted by the atmosphere. \u00a0I went back and got my husband. \u00a0We checked out the menu at La Taperia and decided to eat dinner there, as opposed to the myriad of tapas places on the Passeig de Gracia. \u00a0It looked very Art Deco cool. \u00a0It was absolutely lovely. \u00a0I wish I could say the same about our waiter. \u00a0The service was poor at best. When we arrived,the restaurant was nearly empty. \u00a0The waiter seemed to have an attitude from the get go. \u00a0I am not sure why. \u00a0We were dressed as well as any of the other patrons. \u00a0We were appropriately apologetic for not being able to speak Catalan or Spanish. \u00a0Our 6 year old son was with us, but he is always well-behaved when we eat out, so really, I don't know what the problem was. \u00a0We wanted to order a pitcher of sangria. \u00a0The waiter asked us if we wanted red or cava. \u00a0We said we didn't know what cava was. \u00a0He kept repeating cava until I realized it was with \"champagne\". \u00a0We ordered that, but what arrived was a premixed, bottled, cava sangria called Lolea. \u00a0It did not come in a pitcher as implied by the picture on the menu, nor was it 1liter, as stated on the menu, it was only 750mls and it was 24Euros. \u00a0Also, it tasted like a bottled mojito. \u00a0We sent it back and asked for the regular sangria, which also came in a 750ml bottle made by the same company ... for 20Euros. More importantly,it was not very good and we both woke up with a headache in the middle of the night. \u00a0We ordered about 5 tapas, of which, we only ever received 3. \u00a0Of the 3 we received, we got: Gildas (2pieces) ) for 5Euros, garlic shrimp (4 small shelled shrimp) 7Euros, bread with tomato, olive oil and salt 3.50Euros. \u00a0We waited and waited forever for the rest of our food, but no one came to check on us. \u00a0Other tables were served and received the same dishes we had ordered but had not received. \u00a0When the waiter finally did come to the table, we told him we had not received our food and asked for the check. \u00a0We have had many positive experiences eating all around BCN in touristy and non-touristy areas. \u00a0This was by far the worst service we have ever recieved. \u00a0The food, what we had of it, was tasty, but really small. \u00a0We left very hungry and angry. \u00a0Go to El Nacional to look at the architecture, soak in the atmosphere and maybe have a drink, but save your money and your sanity and eat elsewhere.",
