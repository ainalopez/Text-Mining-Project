    "Gusto is a very modern looking Italian restaurant and the food reflects this slightly. \u00a0I had the house red wine with bruschetta and the Margherita pizza. \u00a0The wait staff was friendly and spoke some English, which was appreciative. \u00a0The bruschetta was really delicious, despite being on the more oily side. \u00a0The pizza itself was good but suffered the problem other reviewers have noted where the middle of the pizza was soupy because either the crust wasn't think enough or the sauce had too much water. \u00a0Regardless it was very good and convenient near the Hospital Cl\u00ednic stop.",
