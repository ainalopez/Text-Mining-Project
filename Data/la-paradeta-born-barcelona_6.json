    "Major love fest!!!! Major!!This is my favorite place in Barelona. It is a city full of delicious eats, tapas and seafood. But this place takes the cake. Casual atmosphere- check!Fresh seafood - most alive and kicking/swimming till you order? Check check!Great wine- check! Amazing cooks? Check x 100!!You come in, you pick your seafood, you tell them how to prepare, and viola! Take your number, find a table and wait for all the magical sea creatures to be delivered to your table. What's not to love? Ahmazing! Tasty! Delicious! Aye!Razor clams~ I got 5 packets! Each has 5 I believe. I got them grilled! Plancha! With green sauce. Delicious beyond words. Seas snails~ simple, fast ,boiled! Tasty.Baby calms/ baby pctopus~ we orders a pound of this. It gets smaller with the grilling but still amazing!Giant grilled prawns - all charred? Ahmazing! I can't get enough even after several visits. Still can't. its simply amazing. We also had a bottle or two of their wine. One red and one white per recommendation of our cook. No complaints there. If you like seafood, if you want to avoid tourist traps and taste the best ingredients? Look no further. You have found the perfect place. If you do require white linen napkins and the suave ambiance over food? Well, just walk away. This place already have huge lines out the door. You'll be doing everyone else a favor. Me? I'm very happy here! They ruined my taste buds because now I can't eat anything less tasty. But I'm very happy I found that seafood nirvana!",
