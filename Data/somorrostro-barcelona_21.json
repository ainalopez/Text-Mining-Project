    "This adorable restaurant deserves all of the great reviews. It has been our best meal in Barcelona so far, by a wide margin. Each dish was perfectly done. The fresh and relatively light seafood dishes cause this place to soar high above more traditional tapas restaurants. Also, the price tag was on the moderate side, all things considered. (Update: We returned to this same restaurant a second time on our last of 10 nights in Barcelona, and now can confirm that this was definitively our favorite restaurant in the City.)",
