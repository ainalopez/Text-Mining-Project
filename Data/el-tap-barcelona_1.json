    "Walked in at 11:10, the host/owner looked down for about 5 minutes before I approached myself. \u00a0Was told kitchen is closed, none of the hours on yelp suggested such. \u00a0Asked for food nearby in catalan and spanish. \u00a0He told me no, it's late. \u00a0There are 2 restaurants next door. \u00a0He had no interest in or care that I took a taxi 20 minutes to get there to try his place. \u00a0Not very tourist friendly, \u00a0even if you can speak basic spanish.",
