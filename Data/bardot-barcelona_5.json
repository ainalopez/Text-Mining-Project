    "Bardot was the venue for our \"proper Catalan dinner\" - meaning a series of substantial courses beyond your usual pintxos or tapas. \u00a0Upon entering, you are welcomed by a very long bar that had stretches and stretches of stools that could easily make patrons happy - especially those who came by to watch the World Cup while enjoying their drinks. Dinner was out of this world with some of the most inventive food that capitalized on local ingredients. \u00a0We had several starters including these delectable squid that was filled with black rice, melt-in-your-mouth croquettes, and fried goose egg with plenty of truffles on top (that was simply accompanied by slices of crusty bread for dunking)! \u00a0But the piece de resistance was the bone-in steak that was served sizzling on an iron skillet. \u00a0Forget mashed potatoes or mac and cheese, the only side dish this steak needed were the freshest slices of tomatoes and cubes of perfectly seasoned cubes of potatoes. \u00a0And for dessert, you ask? \u00a0The simplest yet most divine crepes that were filled with sugar, honey, and butter. \u00a0I may truly have to change my last meal on earth menu to this one!",
