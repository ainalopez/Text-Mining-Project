    "This is by far the worst meat place I've ever been in Barcelona. They have a daily menu for lunch which is now 12\u20ac + Drink in case you want something different from wine or water which I did. For starters I had spinachs with cream, a dish supposedly to be served hot was not hot enough, I could realize they putted it on a microwave to warm it but they didn't leave it enough time either, so... I would have asked someone to warm it for me but with place almost empty no one really paid attention to me. Anyway, I was hoping with second plate I'll be more lucky. I had a typical meat cut... I specifically asked for it to be medium cooked but again, they brought it well done, dry for me... Also, I had another surprise when I saw the guy next to me having the same plate with lunch menu as I was but they served him a bigger cut, almost twice the big. It's simply wrong that it depends of luck to have a decent piece of meat. This was really annoying as I had gotten a very small portion, which was also dry due to overcooking and a very very salty potato. To finish big, they don't accept payment with card and after paying with cash well...they were giving me my exchange for a 50 wrongly. Be careful with that.I'm never ever coming back. If you want to have a decent plate of meat let me advice you, this is not the right place. Not even for the price.",
