    "Great tapas bar with a very friendly staff, delicious food, and romantic ambiance.We had the: Home made octopus terrine, Sea bass ceviche, seafood paella, and Granny's panna cotta. Everything was delicious but the octopus terrine was AMAZING! We sat at the bar and the service was wonderful. They had very tasty sangria and cava (of course). The ambiance is romantic: dark red walls, candle-lit, exposed brick & stone walls...a nice date spot. The menu is a mix of Spanish and Asian tapas but the owner is French and the staff \u00a0speaks very good English. Overall a great find and we would go back!",
