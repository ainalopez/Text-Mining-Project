    "I lived in Barcelona for 6 months and went to this place at least once a week! They use fresh and organic food for everything and you can definitely taste the difference. I am not a vegan or vegetarian and neither are most my friends and everyone still loved this place as much as me. Not only is the food amazing, but the staff is so friendly and happy all the time and can put anyone in a good mood. I recommend this place to everyone.",
