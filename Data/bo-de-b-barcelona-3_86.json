    "Really delicious, well priced sandwiches. The line is long and moves pretty slowly, but it is worth the wait. There is a little store that sells beer and wine next door, grab a drink and take your sandwich over to the beach or one of the nearby plazas or park and enjoy the city. There are a handful of tables in the shop but it is small. A great place for a relaxed, unhurried meal.",
