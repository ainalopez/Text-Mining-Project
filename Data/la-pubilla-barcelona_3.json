    "Our favorite meal in Spain! \u00a0We dropped by for dinner without a reservation as it was early (relatively) in the night and were seated immediately. \u00a0The food was delicious with well-balanced flavors and great attention to detail in the presentation. \u00a0No English menu but both waiters / bartenders spoke English quite well so that wasn't a problem. \u00a0Perhaps most importantly, their effusive passion for the food enhanced our experience even more! \u00a0They took the time to explain the entire menu, pointed out locally sourced ingredients and the heritage behind some dishes, and were very attentive to make sure we enjoyed everything. \u00a0La Pubilla and its owners are definitely on the rise!",
