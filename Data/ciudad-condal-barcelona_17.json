    "This place is popular! I've walked by this place several times on my way to and from my hostel and it was always busy. Food:1) Calamari - it was pretty good. They were lightly battered which is how I prefer calamari. 2) tenderloin sandwich - the steak was cooked medium but the taste was too mild. It felt that there wasn't enough seasoning. 3) 4 cheese melted over bread - if you like melted cheese, you'll like this dish. Very simple and delish. 4) chicken & ham croquette - Service:My server was so incompetent. She charged me for 2 extra items and continued to argue with me that I ordered it. On top of that I ordered an item and she didn't bring it out. English as a second language is no excuse for getting my order wrong when I clearly pointed to each item on the menu. I can let that go but what I can't let go is that she argued with me about it.",
