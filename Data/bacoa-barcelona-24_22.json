    "Worse burger ever.Had the pleasure to taste the best burger around the world ( see @burgerhand ) Order a burger out of many wacky options ( burger w Spanish ham / anchovies ) received an overcooked breaded thing on a horrible dry seeded bun. When I tried biting into it something dripped out of the burger into my hand and burned me horribly to the extent I couldn't continue eating that thing. I just left angry to the nearest Burger King..... At least you know what you gonna get there ( yeah a real burger with no fancy bs) Verdict: if you are a burger snob avoid.",
