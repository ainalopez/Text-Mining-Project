    "\"You'll never eat another state fair churro again\" -- that's what a friend told us. She was right. These are awesome. We tried the ones filled with custard and dulce de leche, then went back for the one with nutella. The dulce de leche one was definitely the sweetest of the bunch, and I really liked the custard one, but the nutella was probably the best of the 3. We've heard that the 'plain' churros are great here, too, but we'll have to go back and find out (not much arm twisting required, trust me!)Get them to go since the place is TINY; you can go sit on a bench in the park across the street and enjoy the deep-fried goodness. Don't forget to grab a few napkins (or more!) on the way out since the fillings tend to escape as you're eating.",
