    "Papitu is a Tapas Bar that is strategically located ( a stone's throw) adjacent to La Boqueria Market in a little square. It serves excellent tapas and draft beer. My Wife and I had a couple of beers here our first afternoon in Barcelona and we came back for tapas and beer the next day. It is a relaxing alternative to eating in La Boqueria (quieter, outdoors with covered seating) and from Papitu you also get the added advantage of being able to view the people and merchants going back and forth from La Boqueria. We'll come back when in Barcelona!",
