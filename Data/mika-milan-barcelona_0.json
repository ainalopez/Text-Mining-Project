    "Found this place (Mika Milan) on my recent trip to Barcelona. Just stopped in for coffee and found a specialness about this place. Went back again the next day. Everything we ordered was exquisite! The service was excellent, the decor and the friendliness of the staff made me feel very much at home in a foreign country. I loved this restaurant and highly recommend it!",
