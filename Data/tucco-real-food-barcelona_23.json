    "Let's keep it real. This place does not deserve 5 stars. Yes, it was extremely cheap. The service was great. However, the pasta was bland and the dessert was alright. If you are on a tight budget, this place is great. However, do not come here expecting good food.Hubby wants to add that this is the second five star place we have been to in Barcelona and got disappointed.",
