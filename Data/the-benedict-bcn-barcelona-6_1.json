    "You have the choice between various eggs + a drink coffee or juice or tea + dessert usually pancakes or chocolate cake mhhhhThe place is very clean and comfortable. The music played will transport you in another time. This is so wonderful and the service is fast and nice.The brunch is delicious but I have to admit that the Milk Bar just beside the Benedicte offers the most original dishes and brunches.",
