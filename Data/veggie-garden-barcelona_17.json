    "Of you want a cheap vegan meal, go here. Good portions. But you get a feeling they want you out as soon as possible. Food isn't that great. No fresh bread, sour gaspacho, sloppy vegetable tart. And don't take a look into the kitchen before eating, it's filthy. There are more vegetarian restaurants near by. Maybe a little bit more expensive but with beter food. The only upside is that this is the only one with tables outside.",
