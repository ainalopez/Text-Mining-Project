    "Excellent place to take a break from tapas and enjoy a great Italian dinner. \u00a0Homemade pastas and excellent dessert. \u00a0Both the gnocchi and fusilli pastas were delicious. Super cute place with only 10 tables. We didn't have a reso but got in luckily. \u00a0Would definitely reco getting a reso though as the place was full.",
