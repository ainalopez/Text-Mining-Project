    "Obviously the best thing on the menu is Santa Marta's signature Aperol Spritz. Grab a table outside, order this Italian classic and you are definitely going to enjoy your time.On the other hand, you would not be the only one doing so:-) Meaning, the place is always packed, and terrace - in particular. Waiters might be slow, but never rude. I have not tried neither of their dishes (they have salads,sandwiches,pizzas - nothing too special), but I guess, by the looks of things, the food is not worse than in eateries nearby (probably even better),",
