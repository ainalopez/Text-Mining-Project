    "This place is great. Fresh sustainable food at affordable prices. We ate here every day in Barcelonetta. Chill vibe, nice staff, good drinks and really nostalgic 90's/2000's r&b. If you are between 26-34 you'll get a kick out of all the throwback songs. You can get 2 drinks, 2/3 apps, split an entree and dessert for $50! All fresh and really good! Try the oysters, they are delicious!",
