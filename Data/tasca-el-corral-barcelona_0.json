    "Got completely crushed here. \u00a0I don't know what is in the Leche de Pantera Rosa, but it packs a wallop. \u00a0So much so that we had to call and cancel our flight out the next day, as we were too hungover to make it to the airport...From what I can fuzzily remember the food was pretty good..some sort of flaming sausage dish, and the owner was a good guy. \u00a0 My head hurts just remembering....",
