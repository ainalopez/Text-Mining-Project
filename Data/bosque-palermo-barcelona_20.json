    "My husband and I wanted to find a good paella restaurant since Barcelona is known for its paella. We searched on yelp and saw the high reviews so we decided to come. My experience was good and bad. If you are prepared to deal with the following, I think you would enjoy this restaurant. Negatives: be prepared to wait awhile before you get seated and finally eat your dinner. After we arrived, we patiently waited in line. I tried telling the waiter that we wanted a table for two but he was so busy that he buzzed right by me without paying any attention. There was no list, which made our experience even more frustrating. Two rude couples skipped right to the front to be seated. We were pissed because they totally cut in line. I wish there was more order to the wait process. I also wish that the staff had told us that we could wait at the bar and order drinks. When we arrived, the bar counter was busy w a lot of people so we waited outside. When the cutters went up front, they just sat themselves at the bar and ordered drinks. Tip: make a reservation before you arrive.In regards to the food, we ordered the meat paella. It was pretty good but a little salty. It took about 30 min plus to get our dish. They were pretty fast in serving our salad. I highly recommend that you order the mussels for about five euros. It was absolutely delicious. Our waitress was pretty nice and efficient. If you are prepared to deal with some seating drama and aren't too hungry when you arrive, this place is perfect.",
