    "Very Famous Restaurant right at the Entrance of La Boqueria Market , in the Middle of Barcelona, Spain.I love the Spanish Tapas they serve and all the ingredients are the freshest you can get because it is inside a open air farmers type of market. Very interesting exotic types of plates and the local draft beer which is Estrella is delightful. The Owner is very nice and attentive to his customers and the mix of customers is fascinating. They are from all over the world !",
