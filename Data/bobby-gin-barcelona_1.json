    "Great bar, horrible food.A great, upmarket bar in the heart of Gracia. One of the best Gin-tonic bars I have found in Barcelona. Ordering outside of the menu, the barman does his best to come up with something really amazing. It is worth sitting up the front near the bar to watch the guy work. On the downside, it is a little pricy, but still worth it for 1-2 drinks.The food though is amazing bad. We were a group of six, and our orders came out 2 at a time, 5 min apart. The veggie burger was probably the worst one we've ever tasted, however the tex mex was decent. The guacamole came with cheap, small, thin potato crisps rather than the normal tortilla crisps, making getting any salsa rather difficult.",
