    "There are exactly two sandwiches that have changed my life. One was from Bay Cities in Santa Monica, CA, and the other was from Bo de B. My friends and I went here on a recommendation and were staring by the time we were seated (bocadillos can be ordered from the window but my friend wanted a salad plate which are only served inside), but luckily we got a sumptuous portion of meat and veggies in the most amazing crusty bread. I love that they marinate the meat and cook it fresh for you, with tons of options for fresh veggies (including unusual choices like lentils) plus awesome sauces - I had the spicy one. \u00a0Every bite was delectable and it was the kind of sandwich that satisfies your hunger after half, but you just can't stop there (we all devoured them). It's a refreshing change from most bocadillos that offer little more than meat or tortilla with a bit of tomato, and if you're ever in Barcelona, you absolutely have to try this little piece of heaven.",
