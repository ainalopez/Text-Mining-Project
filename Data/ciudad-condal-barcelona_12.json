    "What a great way to start off the day with a solid tapas breakfast at the countertop. \u00a0Quick caffeine pick up with a Caffe Latte (balanced but robust), followed by grilled cuttlefish ( seasoned lightly with olive oil and lemon for a slight tartness). The next tapas was the baccalao llauna - just cooked right. \u00a0And the the bravas potatoes deep fried with a melt in your mouth center that is soft, moist, and piping hot.Passed by this place yesterday evening and it was packed to the hilt. \u00a0In the morning getting seated was not a problem. \u00a0And a nice meal before heading what should be limited dining options of Montserrat.",
