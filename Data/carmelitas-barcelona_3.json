    "stumbled upon this place walking home to our hotel. Did not disappoint! Started with patatas bravas and tomato bread (of course)- best we've had. I had the veal, which was spectacular and beautiful. Everything we got was beautiful and super tasty. Very authentic, and surprisingly inexpensive given the plating and sort of hipster decor. Ended with the cocoa bread. Incredible. I love that this place is sort of off the beaten path. Worth every penny. I will be coming back!",
