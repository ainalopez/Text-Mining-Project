    "This is a nice place to try some more inventive tapa size dishes. \u00a0It's not a huge menu but almost everything is unique.I had some absolutely fantastic fried calamari. \u00a0I usually don't even order this as it's kinda the same everywhere you go, but they served rings slightly dusted and with an excellent aoli sauce (kimchi aoli I believe it was called) on top. \u00a0It was just awesome.Their octopus was not that great, in fact you could barely taste the octopus. \u00a0And I got the Golden Pepita because everyone raves about it on here but was just ok in my opinion, too plain for my taste but that's just me.",
