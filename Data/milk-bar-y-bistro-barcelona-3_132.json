    "As it turns out, the Spanish aren't huge on breakfast. My husband was crushed. He loves pastry, but he would have to eat a bucket of it to be sated til lunch, so we went off in search of the rare brunch places.Milk is in a lovely little ex-pat area where you'll hear more English accents and Irish brogues than the native tongue. Milk's breakfast menu is called the \"Recovery Brunch,\" and it totally does smack of warm, comfort food to heal you after a night of drinking.My husband got the french toast, which was very different than American but nonetheless good. He did have to request maple syrup, as it was served with tart Greek yogurt. I ordered the blueberry pancakes, which completely blew my mind. I love pancakes to a ridiculous degree, and these were better than any that I've had before.It was all reasonably priced to boot. It'll be a bit difficult to find without the address, but it's definitely worth it.",
