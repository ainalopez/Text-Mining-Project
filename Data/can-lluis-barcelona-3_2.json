    "My friend and I were definitely the only non locals in this place, so right off the bat we had a good feeling. In typical Spaniard style, the meal began with green olives and bread. We ordered some local red wine and we received extremely generous pours while we listened to the table next to us celebrate a birthday :) I ordered the Escalivada to start, a typical Catalan grilled vegetable dish with eggplant, peppers and onions, doused in olive oil and salt and topped with a salted anchovy. The fish was too salted for my taste, but seemed to be the traditional method and the vegetables tasted incredible! My main course was a Botifarra, which I was told was cow intestines, but in reading about the dish, it is supposedly pork sausage with spices. Either way, it was very tasty and hearty. The crema Catalan here was different than others I \u00a0have tried and did not have a crust, but came in a dish and was swimming in a flavorful liquid. It was good, but nothing to write home about. I was more impressed with my desert, which was custard in a wine glass, topped with chocolate ice cream, doused in Cointreau, and mixed together with a spoon! Unfortunately, \u00a0I cannot remember the name of this wonderful desert. Overall great local experience which I would definitely recommend. The staff was very friendly and seemed happy that we were curious about their local dishes. Warning, pretty sure no one in there speaks English, so if you are not Spanish speaking be prepared for lots of pointing.",
