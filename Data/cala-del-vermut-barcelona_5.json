    "the people here were really nice and the drinks were strong, but the food was pretty bad. everything was reheated or refried and it tasted like it- not fresh at all. we got a sampler plate which we were told would cost 25 euros, but they charged us 33 euros for it. for the price we paid, we have gotten much better tapas at other places. we came here because of all the good yelp reviews and were really disappointed...",
