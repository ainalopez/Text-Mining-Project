    "Arguably one of my favorite places in the world. I had four different dishes here, each one more spectacular than the last. It's a small place with limited staff so be patient and enjoy yourself. Everything from the basket of bread to the wine selection was an exercise in gastronomic hedonism. I think the winner of the evening was the truffle risotto. I'm still searching for something that comes even close. The sirloin with foie gras was a close second. If it's still on the menu, a must. It is worth traveling to Barcelona, regardless of where from, just to have dinner here.",
