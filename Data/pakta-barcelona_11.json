    "One of the TOP 5 meals I've ever had in my entire life! On an anniversary trip to Spain, we toured Barcelona and opted to try out this restaurant since we wanted to try a place affiliated with the Adria brothers post El Bulli. Having been to Peru 2 years ago, we were eager to try this Japanese Peruvian place.This place does not disappoint. We got the Machu Picchu menu and everything was exquisite down to the presentation, creativity, and flavor of dishes. We were seated at the bar where we could see the sushi chefs do their magic, and it was wonderful to see them make each dish. It was PERFECT, and if I ever go to Barcelona again, we will definitely eat here!!!!!",
