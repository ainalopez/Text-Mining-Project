    "Great fresh seafood! Nice interior!Had a few appetizers and for the main, Squid Ink Paella. Friends kinda hyped it up and in the end, it was okay. Personally, I like other kinds of paella better. I would love to try this place again! The sooner the better! If you love seafood and/or paella, try this place! If you order the right dish, I'm sure it won't disappoint!",
