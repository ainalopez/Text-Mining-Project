    "Bodega Vinito would be my neighborhood haunt if I lived in this neighborhood. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Prices: \u00a0Cheap - YET GOOD! \u00a0Besides having barrel wine (which the locals come to refill their liter bottles with), they have a decent selection of bottle wines starting at around 5 euros, with the majority in the 8-11 euro range, and pricier wines as well. \u00a0Setting: \u00a0It's informal, with the whole front wall being the entrance to the small open space. \u00a0Bites: \u00a0the tapas are mostly seafood, but they have some veggie options too. \u00a0The calamari rings were perfect - tender without any of the tough chewiness you get at some places. Everything was well seasoned, and all was reasonably priced. \u00a0Each time I've come here, I've been lucky to get a table to stand at. \u00a0The place is quite tiny. \u00a0Perhaps a good way to become friends with the other patrons? \u00a0I used to come here while waiting for a place at Calders... now I come here as a destination.",
