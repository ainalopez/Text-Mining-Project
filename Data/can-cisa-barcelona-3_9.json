    "I cannot recommend this place enough. We wandered in on the advice of our hotel at 11pm on a Saturday night, and it was absolutely packed. We had made the mistake of not making a reservation, but we got very lucky and a waiter squeezed us in in the corner after 20 mins, but first making sure we got some wine while we waited. Despite the place being absolutely hectic, our waiter made sure we had all the time we needed with him, checking to see how we were getting on with each glass of wine, would we like the same again or to try a different one and explained the flavours in each bottle. Everything sounded so good on the menu that we decided to let him choose some tapas for us, and were delighted we did so. The sardines with apple salsa was amazing, and I think our favourite was the salmon with a creamy italian cheese, I can't remember the exact. And order the cheesecake, you won't regret it! The bill came to 60 euro for 4 decent sized tapas, 5 glasses of wine, olives, bread and a slice of cheesecake for 2 people, which was very much worth it.",
