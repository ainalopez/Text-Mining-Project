    "I am going to give them a 4 but I am sure I will have to reassess this place. I came here because I saw it in time out and since my stage in the states I know how good can be a fish and chips. Knowing that it is a tiny place, probably full of hipster, I know I would have to wait to be seated. the place have several tables, the bar and a couple of long bars at the sides. They have fish and chips as the main star in their menu, so we ordered it, and we had three rounds of beer meanwhile we were waiting. But I can say the wait was worth it. They have fresh local hake instead of cod for the fish and the batter they use is amazing, light and crispy, full of flavours that will bring you a piece of the asia to your mouth. The fish is moist and tender, smooth as silk that melts in your mouth. The fries are amazing, crisp but tender and spiced with a mix of curry spices and salt. And it comes with 2 different deeps, one mango chutney, fresh sweet and sour, and with the classic tartar sauce. The guys are nice and fun, you can see they do their best. My only complain was the time we had to wait, but I will go there on a midweek day and I am pretty sure the experience will be perfect.",
