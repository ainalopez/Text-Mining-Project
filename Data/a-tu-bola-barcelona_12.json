    "Our daughter found this little gem of a restaurant on yelp and the ratings are spot on. \u00a0Four of us feasted on the chicken, beef, chickpea (aka falafel), and pork meatballs when we were in Barcelona in May.The very best falafel (meatballs) that I've ever had: light and perfectly spiced. \u00a0These and the pork meatballs were our favorite. \u00a0Each meatball dish came with its own side which we didn't expect and just made us love this place even more. Very friendly service.",
