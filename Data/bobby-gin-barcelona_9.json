    "The mixologists at this place are to gin what Walter White is to meth. Though I personally prefer meth to gin 9/10, if I were to go to a place for a cocktail in this city it would be a challenge to find a bad one here. They treat their drinks better than I treat my first born child. Now, I don't have a first born child, but if I did then what I said in the sentence before this one would still be a true statement, rather than one I said to drive my point home.",
