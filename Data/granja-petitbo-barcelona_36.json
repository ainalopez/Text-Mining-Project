    "One of the best places for brunch in Barcelona. The food selection is good, the ingredients are always of high quality and the place is all around very nice. Their eggs are cooked to perfection and I love their green juices. I'm also a huge fan of their Caesar Salad, and the carrot cake might be the best I've ever tried.",
