    "6 euro for tomato toast, tortilla, coffee, and fresh juice? Now that's my kind of breakfast! And to top it off - food is delicious and service was very attentive.It was clear that a lot of the people that come here are regulars. I walked in and sat down near the back, and the waiter walked me through all of my options. I was hungry and got their breakfast menu as mentioned above. The tortilla was my favorite - it tasted home made and fresh. The toast was a little crunchy and could have used more tomato, but it was really good and the olive oil was to die for.Excellent coffee and fresh juice. No complaints! This could easily be one of my regular breakfast spots.",
