    "We passed by this place so often and it always looked so cozy and snug, especially in the rain. \u00a0Wonderful bare bulbs hung from the ceiling, colorful books lined the shelves, and everyone always looked so happy inside.One super rainy day, on our way to the Picasso museum, we stopped in for a bite and some cafe con leche. \u00a0Everything was great until we realized we had been waiting over an hour for our food. \u00a0After a month in Barcelona, we got used to the waiters who didn't rush you and the slower method of dining but this was a bit much. \u00a0And the bare bulbs and books only held our interest for so long...The cafe came with these wonderful little biscuits. \u00a0I was into that.All in all, a great place to grab some cafe con leche and catch up on your reading!",
