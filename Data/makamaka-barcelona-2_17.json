    "Great place. Real surf shack feel (the toilets are a beach hut)!Menu is limited in size with salads and burgers dominating but don't let that put you off. Food was good. Large drinks list and local cava was a steal!Strongly recommended. 10min walk from nearest metro and getting taxis, whilst there are plenty can be a lottery after midnight.",
