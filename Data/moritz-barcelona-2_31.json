    "I went twice on my trip. The bombas were good. Mussels were not that great, I wouldn't order again. Bravas--heavy on the aioli. The fish dinner for two was great! The fish was fresh and tasty and came with bread, a large salad and fries. I actually ate it all by myself like the glutton I am. I was tempted to go back again and order it because it was so good. I tried the crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert but the sugar on top was very burnt :-(Ambience was fine, but service was lacking.Side story:I spent a good ten minutes trying to decipher the menu (it was in Catalan) while my friend (who does NOT speak the language) seemed to be reviewing it with extreme ease. Finalllly, I figured out she had the menu in English! Smh, at least I learned a few words?",
