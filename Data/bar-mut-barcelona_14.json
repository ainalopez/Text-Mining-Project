    "Food here is so over the top that I'm thinking it may have been one of the best dinners I've ever had. First of all let's talk about the spinach salad. Fresh, tasty, simple salad with spinach and fig right? Wait a second, it comes on top of melted goat cheese. SO. Glorious. Octopus, egg carpaccio and foie gras-topped filet mignon are amazing as all the other reviews said. I ordered the spinach salad full sized and the other 3 dishes half sized and it was probably too much for 1 person but I ate everything and still asked for dessert. However they needed to clear the table so I was kind of kicked out lol but service was amazing otherwise (offered by extremely sexy waiters) and nothing can ever trump the food here.",
