    "Good place to go if you like terrible service and getting scammed. Like most reviewers, I arrived here with my partner and waited for 15 minutes without service (the waiter ignored us when we signaled while serving other tables). We got up to leave, and three wait staff members - suddenly attentive - ran after us and physically grabbed up both, trying to make us pay for the empty sangria left behind on our table by the last guests. No matter that there were two of us and four empty glasses of sangria, that the previous inhabitants of the table had paid in our vision while we were waiting, or that there are so few tables it's hard to believe they didn't remember who was here before. Fortunately the other guests spoke up and let them know what was what, and they eventually, after some argument, released us. Avoid at all costs.",
