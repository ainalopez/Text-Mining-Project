    "We ordered the Esqueixada (bacalao, or cod salad), bacalao with saffron, and grilled lamb chop.Esqueixada is definitely a five star. Amazingly tasty. \u00a0One of the best thing have ever had in my life. And I'm actually not a fish person.The bacalao with saffron was excellent but eclipsed by the esqueixada.The lamb was the reason for deducting one star. \u00a0For a restaurant so highly recommended by yelpers and travel guidebooks alike the lamb they prepared for us was extremely disappointing. \u00a0 The quality of meat was fairly tender but the flavor was super salty. \u00a0Like they spilled a whole jar of salt instead of rubbing it on. \u00a0I've seriously had better lamp chops at random INDIAN restaurants in America. Anyways. I would definitely go back to the restaurant if I ever visit barcelona again. \u00a0Next time I'll order two full portions of Esqueixada! \u00a0^ ^",
