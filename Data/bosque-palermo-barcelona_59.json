    "This place is so touristy, everyone was speaking in English!We got the seafood and meat paella for 2 (which is the minimum order-2 people per paella). It was ok but very salty, but I think most are. I liked how you can eat off the pan versus other places where they scoop it off onto plates for you.We also had the champagne white sangria in a pitcher, which was nice and sweet. They also provided us with bread with tomato sauce and olive oil (a signature bread dish in Spain!).",
