    "Great tapas experience - as others have written, about 70 choices which you can see and select. Also nice menu choices. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. The quality was very good and price reasonable for what you get. Worth going out of your way to give it a try. We were there on a Monday night about 9 pm and it was booked out.",
