    "This was truly delicious food--my son got a very tasty pizza, and the rest of us got delicious pasta served in a \"basket\" of parmesan cheese. [Note: the menu describes some of the pasta fresca as coming in \"bags\" of pasta. I thought it was a bad translation but they actually look like bags.]Anyway, the desserts were also great (we tried four, they were all delicious) and the service was excellent. They had menus in Italian, Catalan, Spanish, and English and there were lots of vegetarian options.Cloth napkins, too. All in all, quite yummy.",
