    "We came here for dinner and had one of our tastiest meals in Barcelona here. We started out with the soup of the day which was a delicious cold soup of melon/yogurt/mint. Then we had the gaelician octopus which was so tender and flavorful. We also shared the salad of the day which was chicken with bell peppers. The salad was fine, but was pretty much just like any salad you would get in the States. We also had the croquettes and they were lovely. Our server recommended a lovely white wine that went perfectly with our meal. The prices were also very fair. Such a great night!",
