    "This place gets super crowded, and with good reason. \u00a0The tapas are ridiculously cheap - but don't let the low prices fool you. \u00a0The food is delicious, as well as the drinks. \u00a0And surprisingly efficient. I'd venture to say that this place is better than El Tigre (madrid) *GASP* in terms of getting a great bang for your buck.",
