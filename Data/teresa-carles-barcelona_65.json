    "Incredible food! \u00a0Started with Gazpacho, which was delicious. \u00a0The Pappardellisimi, which is pasta with cooked vegetables, was very very good! \u00a0The Apple Crumble with vanilla ice cream dessert was good. \u00a0A lot of crumble :-) \u00a0The ice cream could have been a slightly bigger scoop to accommodate it all. \u00a0I was way full by now and this dessert is good for two to share after that much food.The restaurant has a nice decor and a cozy atmosphere. \u00a0Service was great. \u00a0There are English menus and folks know enough English to help you out.You got to try this out if you are in Barcelona and are not bent upon eating meat.",
