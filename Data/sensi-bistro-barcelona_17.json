    "After scanning Yelp, we landed on Sensei. The host squeezed us in without reservations, graciously. \u00a0We ordered tuna Tar tar to blood sausage to cauliflower with Gorgonzola sauce--all rocked with an elegance beyond the usual tapas heavy handed ness. A pleasure and delight. Near beaches and great for late night wandering along Ramblas.",
