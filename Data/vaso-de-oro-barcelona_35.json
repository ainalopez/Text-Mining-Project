    "Been to Barcelona seven years in a row and I go here every time. Still one of my fav places, all categories. At dinner-time, they're packed, which is a great feeling if you're hanging with friends. Daytime it's calmer and even suitable for lunch with kids; been there with a two-year-old and they took good care of him, even putting the bravas sauce on the side for our potatoes so he could eat them too.Food-wise, they've got some of the best tapas in town. The solomillo (steak) is deservedly well-spoken of but anything they serve is great. They reputedly make their own beer, and it's a good one.You'll need to at least try to speak Spanish, or even better, Catalan, as they hardly speak a word of English (or at least refuse to) but don't despair if you're not a linguistic genius; any attempts are met with humour and good service in return, even if you just say a word or two. Just point at anything you want and use sign language.It's no occasion that this place consistently tops most lists of best tapas restaurants in Barcelona.",
