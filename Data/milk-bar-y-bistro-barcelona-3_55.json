    "The food was great. Probably some of the best I've had in Barcelona. The reason for the four stars is: my girlfriend saw the waitress skip washing her hands after using the bathroom, and the waitress was extremely inattentive. I had to get up to get her attention twice when the restaurant was almost empty. Other than that, it's a great restaurant.",
