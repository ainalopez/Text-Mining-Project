    "Great atmosphere. Fun and entertaining and friendly staff. Reasonable priced tapas at 4 euro or less. Some menu items were pricey outside of tapas (sirloin). The beer was good but filled with quarter of foam which was kind of the atmosphere but beers were a little pricey so it was frustrating.",
