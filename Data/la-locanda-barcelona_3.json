    "This place is the perfect respite to the tourist hell that is La Rambla. Not hard to find if you venture into the Barri Gotic just past the cathedral. \u00a0Popular with locals, most tourists seem to avoid it as there's no outdoor seating, jugs of Sangria or microwaved paella. The food is simply fantastic! Ravioli to die for, wood-oven pizza as good as you'll find. After days of tapas I was craving a simple green salad and some complex carbs. La Locanda delivered both but the taste and quality well exceeded my expectations. The service was the best I've experienced in Barcelona - attention to detail, friendly, fast and English speaking for Numpties like me who's Spanish is attrocious (I keep trying - hard to believe but I was born in Madrid!).La Locanda is just a simple little Italian place in Barcelona who do what they do really, really well.",
