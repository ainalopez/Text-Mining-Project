    "Slices of pizza are hard to find in Europe. This place is fantastic! \u00a0For any New Yorkers, this is similar to My Pie at 59th & Lex. Fun place, a few tables in the back. Young vibe. Fresh ingredients. Excellent combinations. Pizza is purchased by the weight. They cut the slice to the size you request, then hear it up. Roughly 10 combinations of toppings are available at any time. Fast, fresh, fun. Great experience!",
