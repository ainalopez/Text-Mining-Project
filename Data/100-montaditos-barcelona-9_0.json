    "Came here the first day I arrived after my plane ride here. It was right across from the hotel I stayed in which was really convenient for me. On Wednesdays and Sundays they have all montaditos and other appetizers like French fries for 1 Euro. Chicken wings are 2 Euros. What a steal!! They are a great snack if you're only eating one. If you want to eat a few then they can make a meal. There are 3 separate categories of montaditos. If you get one of their platters containing 5 montaditos, it is only 5 montaditos. This is applicable for any day of the week.",
