    "This place is absolutely fantastic! Our group stumbled upon this restaurant by accident and ended up absolutely loving it. What makes Cornelia and Co unique is that it also is a market where patrons can buy fresh cheese and bread, wines, sausages, chocolates and other goods. I definitely recommend this place for anyone staying in downtown Barcelona looking for a good, healthy meal.",
