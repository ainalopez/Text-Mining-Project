    "We stopped here on spec for a beer and a bit of tapas and it was so good we came back a few days later for dinner. It was terrific - the tapas selection of meat was divine (1/2 portion is enough for 2 sharing) accompanied by delicious tomato bread. Our waiter was helpful and advised us to reserve the cheese plate to after our entrees and also suggested wines for each course. The cod with liquorice and the baby cuttlefish with black rice were amazing and the wines a perfect match. Everything looks and tastes good here. Entrees are modest, and pica- pica plates on the generous side. Great quality food at reasonable prices (for a high-end eaterie). We shared 1/2 plates of meat and cheese, 2 entrees and 2 desserts with a cava, white and red wine each for c. \u20ac80.",
