    "Walked by this place and decided to stop in as it was semi busy around 1930. Sat at a table and was ignored for at least 20 minutes even though multiple waiter and waitress made eye contact so they knew we were there. Waiters Walked by and served other customers nearby multiple times without even saying hello or a head nod. I gave the benefit of the doubt as half the place was full until I saw the waiterPull out what look like a piece of broken plate out of a dish look around, walk away, and then come back a minute later and serve the dish. Left immediately after I feel sorry for whoever got that dish.",
