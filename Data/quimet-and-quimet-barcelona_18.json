    "I do not know his name but the man behind the counter is a magician! He can engage the patrons, keep tab of all everyone consumes and best of all create delicacies that literally melt in the mouth! The beef baguette is divine! We tried the salmon with honey which was outstanding. It hit my palate perfectly but my husband was much more enamored by the beef and the prawns.We did not care much for the olives but then something had to give! We were conveniently staying two alleys from Quimet so it was no brainer to try it! We recommend it even if you have to walk miles for the pilgrimage - an oasis in a desert where the rest of the places in neighborhood were just ok.",
