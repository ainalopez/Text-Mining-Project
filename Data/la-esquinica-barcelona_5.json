    "one of my favourite spots in Barcelona. \u00a0Definitely one of my go-to-joints when visitors are in town. \u00a0Tapas - family style! \u00a0 Great food, great prices, but it's easy to go over board when ordering tapas, especially when they're good...be careful!The only downside is, \u00a0it's always packed. \u00a0They don't take reservations, so you basically have to wait in line until your number is called. \u00a0To me, long lines are a good sign for good food. just saying.I highly suggest the pimientos de padron (look like deep fried jalepenos, but they aren't spicy), chipirones (deep fried baby squid), pulpo gallego (Galician style octopus), & los tigres (stuffed mussels - my personal fav).The restaurant is definitely off the beaten path of tourists, but well worth it. \u00a0The waiters get very busy, but they've always been friendly.",
