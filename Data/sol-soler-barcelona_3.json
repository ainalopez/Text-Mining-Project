    "Found this great little place in a quiet square. The food was delicious and reasonably priced, plus the service was very friendly. Our waiter even entertained our terrible Spanish for 10 minutes before giving some great recommendations in English. We were able to try some small samples too. The radish gazpacho is highly recommended.",
