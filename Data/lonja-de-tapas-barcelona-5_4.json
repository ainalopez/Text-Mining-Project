    "We came here to sit and drink a little bit while waiting for our reservations at Tapeo. Fairly spacious with lots of seating, it wasn't as busy as other tapas locations in the vicinity. Our bottle of wine was priced ok. No service really as we were seated at the bar. Bathrooms located in the very back past the bar.",
