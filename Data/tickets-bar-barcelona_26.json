    "This review is a tough one. There are many things about this tapas bar that's overrated but there are also some taste winners that even out the entire experience. So I waited more than a month to get a spot. I was alone and there was a long line to enter. It was strange that the number of us dining alone were seated at awkward spots. I had the luxury of facing the kitchen and could see three chefs plating one dish at a time. It screamed attention to detail obviously. But some of the dishes like the peanuts, watermelon, olives and squid were alright. They were delicious but they didn't exactly wow my tastebuds. Then there were these:The chicken burger, which sounds so boring had two pieces of crispy skin on top of the chicken bits. Insane flavor with some gravy, this burger was amazing. \u00a0Pasta made of basil. \u00a0Gelatinous texture, the pasta tubes in a cream sauce was light and refreshing. Snow crab wrapped in avocado skin. Simple combo that really worked. A reverse gazpacho - a clear tomato jelly that packed a punch. Cheese puffs - filled with cream and served with manchego were so light and tasty I inhaled them in no time. Chocolate dumpling. Passion fruit ice cream filled in a chocolate dumpling. \u00a0It was great!One thing I wasn't thrilled with was the cheap cava they serve. I react to cheap bubbly and their cava made me break out pretty quickly. Nonetheless it was an experience. I recommend coming here with friends and not being too hungry. I ate a lot but didn't feel stuffed by the end of the meal. Defo worth a shot getting a table at tickets.",
