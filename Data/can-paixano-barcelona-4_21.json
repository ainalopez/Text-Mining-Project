    "This is one of my favorite memories of Barcelona during my last visit, and funny this was one of the few places that were open early enough before the typical 11am/12pm wake up time of this late night city where most restaurants are the busiest around 11pm.I had breakfast / brunch here and was able to get \u20ac2-3 cava / sparkling wine! This is definitely down an alley way, but fairly close to the hotel I stayed at so it provided a perfect buzzing early bite to start the day. There is a huge selection of cured meats, cheeses, pastries, and olives. Some of the best and most well priced tapas I've ever had. This place is, no need to say, standing room only but it actually got quite crowded at the early hour of 9am or so since there weren't a lot of places that were open this early.The staff / servers are extremely friendly and know a little English so you can definitely get by although I used some of my very, very broken and high school Spanish which came in handy.What a gem!",
