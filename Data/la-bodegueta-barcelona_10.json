    "Potates braves (sp?) are fantastic. Ordered house red wine and it was one if the best reds I've ever had. The toasted bread with olive oil and tomato is delicious, especially with the order of goat cheese. Also ordered olives and spicy chorizo. Was a lovely little dinner. Ambiance is quaint, though could do without the fluorescent lights. Regardless, food is so delicious (and cheap!) that this place is def worth a visit for lunch or dinner.",
