    "The place is decent. But we are told there is no tap water and we are not allowed to drink our own bottled water either. That's insane, never come across the situation before. No less than two tapas per person and we are charged for cover+bread that we are not told we are offered and have to pay for at the beginning. \u00a0Food is fair, but the paella is a mini portion and too salty.",
