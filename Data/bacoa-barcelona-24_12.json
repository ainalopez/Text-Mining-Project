    "This was a really solid burger joint. I ordered the Cl\u00e1sica burger, which was just a plain burger. It came out very quickly and was mucho delicioso. They have homemade sauces at the table - two hot sauces and a ketchup. The sauces weren't very spicy, but the ketchup was exceptional. It had a slightly smoky, bbq flavor.Definitely recommend for anyone trying to eat something different than tapas. Also the music was on point.",
