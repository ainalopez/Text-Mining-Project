    "This place is great. Big portions and a nice selection of homemade sauces! I got the japonesa which is a teriyaki burger cooked perfectly medium rare. My brother got the bacoa burger, which has to be their biggest burger. It's stacked with meat, bacon, 2 cheeses and pickles. If you're looking for a gut wrencher, get the bocoa!",
