    "Life doesn't get much better than this: a small plate of \u00a0fried sardin, fresh out of the kitchen, a simple salad of heavenly tomatoes, onions and olives and vino tinto in tiny cups! La plata knows how to make good food, you may have only 4 choices but they're done to perfection. Went back there twice in 2 days and it's one of the reasons I'm sorry to leave Barcelona. Don't miss out on this place!",
