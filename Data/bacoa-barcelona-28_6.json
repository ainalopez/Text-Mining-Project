    "WOW! \u00a0Great place, great vegetarian friendly concept. This place has the best vegetarian burger we have ever eaten! What a relief to finally have a real vegetarian meal in a city where all there seem to have is seafood and meat. \u00a0We ordered our burger and salad without goat cheese and it was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good veggie burger with fries, bravas and/or a good salad.",
