    "We just had a meal for 13 people in varying parts and had to send 3 meals back and reorder one with one missing meal. The food itself is mostly good but the service was appalling. Very disappointed after visiting for lunch before and then choosing it for a birthday celebration. It didn't add up to a successful evening despite negotiating almost 200 euros from the bill. Unfortunately we will not return, which is a shame as its a lovely venue.",
