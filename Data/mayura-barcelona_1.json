    "As I was strolling downtown in Barcelona, I was first intrigued by the contemporary concrete branding from outside of this venue. As I heard the subtle splash of a water fountain and the colourful south Asian styled interior I was already sold to step inside and see for myself what more there was to discover. The bar made with a running fountain and the fresh exotic flowers complimenting it with the he colourful walls, antique furniture and silk pillows made me feel like I had stepped into another country. I was impressed with the service and variety of drinks, juices and cocktails. This place is truly for lounging. We ordered curry, rice naan bread and salad. It was a typical south Asian dish with a perfect taste, balancing out the spices and light feel of vegetables. The relaxing atmosphere and south of water with the food made this place a gem during my trip to Barcelona. If you want a more casual day-time atmosphere or a Buddha bar experience, look no further.",
