    "We decided to come here for our last dinner in Barcelona after reading all the wonderful reviews online, but I have to say I was a little disappointed. First of all, we didn't make a reservation because it was quite late already and from our experiences in Spain thus far, it didn't seem necessary and we were pretty flexible and willing to wait. When we got there, the place was full (it was a tiny space) and we waited for 15min to find someone to speak to. The guy was pretty rude, he was walking out down the street, probably looking for a smoke and without a backward glance he said \"no seats for tonight!\". It's not like they had a private party and the place was booked out! Anyway, we checked online again and we could make a reservation right there for 1.5 hours later, and we didn't mind the wait so I did it (apparently was supposed to get a 10% discount too). The person from the restaurant E-mailed me about 30min later, to inform us that our reservation has been pushed back another 15min. At this point I was already abit annoyed but since we were just drinking nearby and had no other plans, we decided to wait it out.The food was fine, nothing spectacular, although the patatas bravas is one of the better ones I've had in the city. The service was pretty slow, we had to request for our wine glasses to be refilled multiple times, and the waiter was definitely much more attentive to the Spanish speaking family next to us!The bill was as we expected (wine is so cheap and good here!), and of course no 10% discount was given. I didn't remember this at the time and forgot to ask, but it didn't really improve my impression of their service...",
