    "after 28 courses (and 3 bottles of cava), we left tickets completely sated, knowing that we had just eaten the best meal of our lives. \u00a0rather than describe what i ate, i posted photos of everything...utterly superlative.the only problem - after being taken to the terrace for 2 dessert courses, we were kind of ignored for 45mins. \u00a0we had to ask for the check 4 times. \u00a0i should probably only give them 4 stars based on that, but i can't wait until i get to go back next summer.",
