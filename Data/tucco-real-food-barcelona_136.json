    "Found this place from yelp and the 5 star review does not lie. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and explained the menu thoroughly and gave us great suggestions. The lasagna and 4 cheese fehttuchini were amazing and was more than enough food for two. At around 20 \u20ac This food was a steal! \u00a0If you're in Barcelona I would recommend this place to anyone!",
