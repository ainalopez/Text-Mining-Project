    "I've been coming to this place for about four years now, and the pizza has always been consistently delicious. Prices haven't really changed over this period, as well! It's always so nice to find a good, affordable, tasty hotspot near las Ramblas. As other people have said, its about 5 euros for two slices; they also have various meal deals. This is specifically a focaccia style pizzeria-- don't expect American or Italian pizza. Favourites: the green olive is unbelievable, the roquefort is my husband's favourite, and their new coffee ice cream thing is so YUM.",
