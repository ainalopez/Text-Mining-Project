    "No reviews on this restaurant. Not sure how long they have been open but it is located on the top floor of a shopping mall. \u00a0Amazing views all around you of the entire city of Barcelona. It seemed to be a touristy area. We decided to have dinner here as we were exhausted from walking all day. \u00a0Lovely decor, friendly staff. They were very busy the night we came but luckily we got seated immediately. \u00a0I learned one thing dining out in Barcelona. Sit, relax, and do not rush. People who live here are very chill, no rushing and don't expect your server to be at your table every five minutes. We started with Sangria's. OMG, huge glass filled with fresh fruit, dry not sweet. Oh my I could not have enough. They were the BEST sangria's I have ever drank. I ordered a fresh salad with goat cheese, apples, and pecans. Hubby ordered Paella. The food was ok. Hubs was not impressed with the Paella. It was good and he ate most of it. More on the boring side with not much flavor. Our service was decent although it took us 20 minutes to pay our bill. \u00a0Touristy area, this restaurant is all about the decor and view. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes but worth checking out if your visiting the mall. It was the busiest restaurant out of them all. They deserve four stars for their amazing delicious Sangria's. I'm still dreaming about them.",
