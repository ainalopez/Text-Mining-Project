    "We arrived late at night in Barcelona, hungry, cranky and tired. \u00a0We found Eden on Yelp and as it was close to our hotel we decided to see if we could find it. We were made to feel so welcome and at ease. \u00a0The pizza arrived, crispy and delicious within moments. After a few glasses of wine and our very tasty vegetarian pizza we felt renewed. \u00a0They even packed up a second Margarita pizza for us to take back to the hotel for our tired teenagers. \u00a0The menu looks like they have a lot more than just pizza. \u00a0We will definitely be returning again.j",
