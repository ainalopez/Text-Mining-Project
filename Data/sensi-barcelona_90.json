    "Highly populated with Americans on holiday, so my boyfriend and I awkwardly fit right in with the crowd. We were seated a couple minutes after our arrival. The service was very good. It is somewhat of a tiny space, so there are at least 3 people walking by non-stop checking on your table. We ordered 4 tapas: paella, artichoke hearts, truffle ravioli and something else phenomenal that I can't recall at the moment. One glass of sangria was very refreshing and had me leaving the restaurant feeling just fine. I can't stand it when restaurants charge you for a few slices of baguette, but on the way out they were kind enough to offer free shots \"to help with digestion\".I would recommend this spot to new travelers. It was an enjoyable experience. I love Barcelona for the kind people and delicious tapas (among other things)!",
