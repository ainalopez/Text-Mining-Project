    "A little excerpt on my love for Brunch & Cake in Barcelona...Brunch & Cake, I love you. Even though I am now on the other side of the world, I still think about your iced coffees with cream on top, your sweet and tropical fruit and I cannot forget, those amazing ricotta pancakes with strawberries, coconut and maple syrup that you served to me on that hot and sticky morning. Yes, there may have been plastic in my iced coffee the first time I met you, but you apologised and quickly made me another one. You and all your friends were so friendly and helpful, which is why I had to come back a second time!Every day I miss your wonderful food and drink and I dream about the next time I'll be in Barcelona, because the first stop will be you, Brunch & Cake, because I love you...",
