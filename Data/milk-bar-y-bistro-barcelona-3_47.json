    "Adorable small restaurant with everything served nicely and for a fair price. I had huevos rancheros, slightly spicy, totally delicious! I added a side of steamed baby spinach, also gorgeous - and a latte on the side, all for \u20ac11.95. A lovely British couple at the next table struck up a conversation as we leisurely made our way through our eggs. Lovely atmosphere and very friendly service. I just may make my way back there for a cocktail later too!",
