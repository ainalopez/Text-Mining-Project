    "there are much much better places for the money. \u00a0prices here are 2x more than other 'famous' places in Barcelona.Another reviewer mentioned super salty paella. \u00a0yup. \u00a0got it, salty as f--k. \u00a0seafood on it was bland. i like al dente but this rice was a bit too hard. \u00a0my bowels will not be happy later. my kidneys will not appreciate having to work overtime with all that sodium.their plate jamon was 24 euros but not the best. \u00a0their pan con tomate was really good though! oh, had to send back 2 plates of clams because there was so much sand they were not edible. \u00a0came back with a plate of cockles. \u00a0like, 8 cockles. \u00a0for 15 euros. \u00a0 which were good but preparation-wise, nothing special - salt and olive oil. \u00a0squeezed lemon on top. \u00a0for 15 euros.was thinking about getting dessert too but didn't wanna chance it. i usually don't care about price if the food is good. \u00a0but if i'm gonna eat shitty food, don't make me feel doubly bad by eating shit food and grossly overpaying.",
