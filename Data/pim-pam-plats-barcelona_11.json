    "A Pim Pam Burger is a real-life Krabby Patty. \u00a0Ever wonder why all the Krusty Krab customers have hearts in their eyes as they chow down a patty? \u00a0Grab a burger from Pim Pam and you'll understand why. \u00a0This place is beyond great-- with tons of burger options, there's something for everyone on the menu PLUS all the food is cooked to order. \u00a0The actual restaurant is tiny, but there's a take away option if there are no seats available. \u00a0It takes a little bit for the food to cook, but, in this case, good things come to those who wait. \u00a0If Pim Pam delivered, this place would be heaven!",
