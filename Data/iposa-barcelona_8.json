    "My husband and I enjoyed a tasty lunch here one afternoon after visiting the contemporary art museum. The spot is cozy, the interior kind of awesomely funky, the menu small and on a white board. Whoever wrote it on that particular day didn't have particularly good handwriting, and combined with my bad Spanish we had a hard time figuring out what was being served. I recognized the words for garbanzo beans and feta cheese, so I went with that dish. My husband got a ham and melon salad. Our meals both began with some tasty gazpacho. Both our entrees were fresh, well seasoned, and delicious. Definitely light and healthy compared to most of the food we'd been eating during the trip. The price was right and the service was pretty good. I'd recommend it.",
