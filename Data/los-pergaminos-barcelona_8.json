    "Paella is their specialty & that's exactly what we were looking for! They offer several varieties and we chose the seafood option. Our server told us the dish takes 1/2 hour to prepare and the price on the menu is per person for 2 diners to share. We were brought the tomato bread and olives plus a good red wine to get us through our wait.In slightly less than 30 minutes we were delivered an iron skillet of a most delightful paella loaded with mussels, prawns, shrimp and a few clams (these were amazing & left us wanting more). The rice had a creamy risotto quality to it in the best possible way with fabulous little crispy bits around the edges. Service was attentive and efficient throughout our visit. The location is on one of the windy pedestrian streets in the Gothic section of Barcelona and that added even more to the experience. Beautiful place for a lovely dinner - 4.5 Stars!",
