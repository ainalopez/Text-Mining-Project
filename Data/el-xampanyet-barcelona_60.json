    "Tapas tapas tapas! \u00a0And don't forget the cava! We were lucky to get a small table, as it got really crowded here. \u00a0It certainly is a hot spot! \u00a0My hubby heard about this place from one of the travel books, and it was a huge plus this is next door to Espai Barroc (see below) and a few steps away from the Picasso museum. All the tapas we had were so delicious and made our stomachs happy:- Bread with tomato - Olives- Jamon that melts right in your mouth!- Manchego cheese - Anchovies- Almond biscuits with a cup filled with sweet liquor in the middle for dipping!And of course, a full bottle of cava to complement your tapas!",
