    "One of the best meals we ever had.. It was FANTASTIC. I was lucky to be seated \u00a0right next to the kitchen and enjoyed watching Chef Dani Rueda prepare the food. He is such a perfectionist, he checked each plate as it went out, even sending things back to be done properly. The food was picked up within seconds of prep, so each diner got their food immediately. We had so many things, everything was perfection. We arrived around 8:30 but the tiny place became extremely crowded. Suggest going early or even calling ahead for a reservation. Easy to find, next to Picasso Museum. Highly highly recommend.",
