    "We had reservations for my friends birthday and enjoyed a seat between the kitchen service window and bar. The energy was lively, a nice mix of locals and tourists and the menu offered morsels if happiness. It is a nice break from the traditional tapas menus and the presentation of the dishes is quite creative.",
