    "This place is an absolute blast! What a great way to experience the local culture and get some delectable bites (pinxtos) of fabulous food! And wow, the selection is staggering! You stand at the counter and ask for a plate while you eye all the toothpick skewered delights in front of you and along the length of the bar. From sardines on bread to Iberian ham and more savory bites like pickles and olives, the choices will have your mouth watering. Every few minutes they bring out more from the kitchen, typically hot bites including scallops and sausages and other amazing nibbles. Make sure you try to stand at the far end of the bar and you'll be closest to the kitchen and more likely able to grab one before they're gone. Remember to keep each toothpick on your plate. That's how they calculate what you owe. Each bite is the same price. Caution! It's easy to get carried away!! Choose wisely!!",
