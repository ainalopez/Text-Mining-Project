    "Really cool little place on Las Ramblas! Easy access and great location. My suggestion grab a juice from the mercat and then a box from wok to walk. Try the peanut sauce with shrimp, and extra veggies. If you want it more spicy they have sirachha on the tables. The food is just as good as the show that you get to watch of the staff cooking.",
