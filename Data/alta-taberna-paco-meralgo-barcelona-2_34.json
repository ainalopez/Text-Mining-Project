    "This is my favorite restaurant in Barcelona. \u00a0Everything is fresh, not too over the top and you can actually taste the ingredients.Pan con tomate is excellent, the little shrimp omlette thing is divine. \u00a0The best by far, is almejas a la plancha. \u00a0I'm drooling just thinking about that sitting at my desk at work in NY.",
