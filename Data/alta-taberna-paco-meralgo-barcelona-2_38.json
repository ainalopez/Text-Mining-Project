    "I love Paco Meralgo. Amazing tapas, some of the best in the city.My wife is from Barcelona and my in-laws eat out often. This is their favorite tapas spot in the city. It's a bit pricier than others, but very reasonable. For those of you that don't speak Spanish, the restaurant appears to be named after someone. However, PA - COMER - ALGO means \"for eating something\" (loosely translated). Enjoy this great spot!",
