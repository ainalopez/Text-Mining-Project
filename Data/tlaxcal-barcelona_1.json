    "This is the first spot my boyfriend and I had dinner at when in Barcelona for vacation last year (sorry run-on). We were so sick of crappy tapas in Seville and we're looking for a REAL MEAL. I of course yelped this Mexican restaurant (can go wrong with Mexican) and was not disappointed. The tacos were legitimately good, and so were their drinks! Kind of pricey for what it is, but that's to be expected in a major city where Mexican food is rare. Definitely worth a stop if you're homesick!",
