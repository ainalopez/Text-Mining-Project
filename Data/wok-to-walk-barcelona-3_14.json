    "I think this place is my favorite \"fast food\" in the area. The only thing that would give it one more star, was if it was more of a sit down and hang out kind of place, with a bar. But the food is great, super fresh and fast. All the locations near me are very friendly and efficient. I expect to return to this place a lot while I'm here in Barcelona. \u00a0Also, I don't know of anywhere in NYC where you can get healthy fast food at 2am. This is a true gem.",
