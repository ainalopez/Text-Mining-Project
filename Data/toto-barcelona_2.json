    "Walked over to toto because it was close to our hotel and seemed like a great place. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a friendly host. The restaurant has a great NYC/SF feel to it and the decor is eclectic and modern. Food was wonderful and a army of chefs prepared them fresh and fast as we ordered. Taste was on par and staff was friendly and accommodating. Definitely a place we would return to again and enjoyed for lunch.",
