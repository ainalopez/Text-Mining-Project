    "Eating here was one of the highlights of my entire trip!!! My husband and I came here for \u00a0 lunchtime tapas. I ordered the sea bass, the artichoke dish, and topped everything off with a Catalan Cream (Spain's version of a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e). While every mouthful was heavenly, I'm not kidding when I say the artichoke dish was possibly the best thing I've ever eaten. I was actually inspired to walk back to the kitchen and meet the chef. This spot is filled with such kind people who take great pride in their craft. The chef even sent out homemade chocolate truffles with our coffee to thank us for our kind words. When I return to Barcelona, this will honestly be my first stop! Don't miss it!!",
