    "Visited Palosanto earlier with my family. Really nice looking/trendy interior, and English speaking staff, but the nice interior isn't enough. Absent service (from 3 at the table got their food and until the last one got the plate it took more than 10 minutes, despite several reminders) - and food was nice but not equivalent to the price. We had to ask for the bread and got a tiny portion quite a while later. This place could be superb with the location and interior, though. And the staff was nice and smiling despite the above.",
