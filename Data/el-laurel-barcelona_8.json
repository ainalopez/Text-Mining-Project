    "This place was our favorite. Very small but had no problem getting seating. The servers we had both times we came were very friendly. They have decently priced wine here and a great selection of empanadas. If you want something that isn't premade, do their entrees. They are amazing. My wife and I tried the chicken in a leek sauce and the salmon ravioli in a walnut sauce. Both blew us away, we had no idea it would be this tasty! Highly recommend, will definitely be back if we come to Barcelona again.",
