    "This venue is fantastic! From the entrance door to the restroom :DIf you walk along through the Beach Passage you would only see a unique tiny little building used as a door to the underground club facing the beach.A little Pricey but this place IS worth a try! Splendid venue for dining, chilling out and partying with very international crowd. Just every place in one!We got tasty Beef Tandoori, nice Yakimeshi (Rice) and mighty yummy Laksa (spicyIndonesian-Malaysian Soup) - the best one I ever got outside Asian Continent!!!I would dare myself to cross some celebs at Mid Nite Party next time Im in Barca ;)",
