    "I found THAT neighborhood bar in Barcelona. \u00a0Darkly lit, wood tables and hipsters. \u00a0Alas, rosemary potatoes a must, fresh savory and sweet crepes. \u00a0Cava averages 3 Euro for a bottle two glasses worth. \u00a0Fresh fruit for home spun slushy daqueries a must aligned w frescas and watermelon. \u00a0During the day one can sit in the plaza for people watching. \u00a0Love the painted decor of peacocks on the walls.PS The burger cooked perfect medium rare with veal and lamb a must.",
