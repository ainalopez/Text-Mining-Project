    "If you have one meal in Barcelona, this should be it. \u00a0We had our first meal here on a week long trip and everything else was held to this impossibly high standard. It is filled with locals which is a good sign and had an unassuming but pleasant air. \u00a0 The food was incredible. Tried the grilled octopus and it was mind-blowingly amazing. \u00a0The bacalao salad was so fresh tasting - a hint of salt and just right proportion of tomato and oil. The tomato bread was delicious - crispy and savory in all the right places. \u00a0Skip 7 Portes and go here.",
