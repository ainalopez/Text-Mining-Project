    "I use Yelp a lot but this is my first review. \u00a0 Time and time again I and those with me benefit from the feedback of others so need to return the benefit1st evening in Barcelona and didn't know food options for dinner. \u00a0Yelp didn't let us down. Machianna's was splendid food and nice atmosphere. \u00a0We were a party of 8 and we had terrific service in spite of how busy they were. Lasagna was delicious! \u00a0Salads spectacular! \u00a0 Noodle pasta's were very nice and the sauces, both pesto and red sauces were superb! \u00a0What a jewel of a place! \u00a0Although we didn't know you order direct to the kitchen and grab a table afterwards, it was still a terrific experience with a great atmosphere. \u00a0Noise level was good even though busy!",
