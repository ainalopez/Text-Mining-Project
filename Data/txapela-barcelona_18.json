    "Stopped by here my last night in Barcelona. \u00a0Sat at the bar and the service was decent. \u00a0The hot tapas were good, except for the beef and cheese. \u00a0The beef was still bloody and very medium rare, which is not how I like my meat at all. \u00a0I was hoping I didn't leave with food poisoning. \u00a0The chocolate cake dessert and the cheesecake were delicious and probably the best part of the meal. \u00a0Prices for everything was spot on.",
