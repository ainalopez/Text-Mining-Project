    "I like very much this place because they serve a really cheap and tasty kebab. It us located in a really nice street on the Raval (Joaquin Costa) that happens to be 100 yards from the MACBA museum of modern art (skaters on the premises). I agree with others, their hand made flat bread is amazing. And they don't go cheap on the meat they put in the kebab, there is plenty. I have to say that I always take my meal to go. I live nearby and is not the cleanest place on earth. And also, same hand is preparing your food is giving you the change. But hey, you are paying 3-4 euros for a really tasty and fresh piece of middle east. Also they seem to be following strictly the muslim law so they do not sell alcohol on their premises.",
