    "Of course I realize that any of the restaurants in Plaza Real are going to be super pricey, but you're paying for location, and that's pretty much what's expected of you as a tourist. \u00a0How else can you sit and fantasize living in one of the apartments that looks out onto the plaza, with their soaring ceilings and big shutters?The people watching is great, and the service and tapas here were great as well. \u00a0I appreciated that there was not someone trying to drag me in to sit down, and as it looks like it was recently updated (linens, umbrellas), it caught my eye amongst its competitors. \u00a0Their sangria isn't as sweet as they make it some other places, but that was just fine.",
