    "Really great empanadas!I came here to meet up with the fabulous Kat T. who was visiting from LA, on a recommendation from the equally fabulous Robert M. Our criteria for the day: \u00a0something affordable, and delicious in a place that can accommodate a group of 5 adults and 2 kids. \u00a0With outdoor seating if possible. \u00a0And Rekons provided all of the above. \u00a0Well, the 5 of us (and 2 baby strollers) crammed around a 4-top on the sidewalk terrace, to enjoy a table full of empanadas and salads and patatas bravas.What's recommended: \u00a0get the salad and 2 empanada plate which comes with a drink and a coffee for just under 11 Euros. \u00a0It was very filling, and I couldn't even finish my salad (when does that ever happen to me?). \u00a0Service was friendly and in typical Spanish fashion, very slow - but that was ok since we were just chatting away and enjoying hanging out. \u00a0There was a constant queue of people waiting for seating or ordering food for take away - so it's definitely a popular place. \u00a0and judging by the food, I could see why.",
