    "This little gem was near our Airbnb so we decided to go check it out. It was excellent! They have a wide variety of pressed and natural juices. My boyfriend got the nana with pineapple and other tropical fruits--it was delicious and so refreshing! I had a classic natural orange juice which is always a winner in my books. For brunch, we both got the huevos rancheros and they did not disappoint! The tortilla and beans underneath the sunny side up eggs gave the dish a nice Mexican influence without being too overpowering. It was topped with arugula and salsa which gave it a nice fresh taste! Everything looked fantastic, I wish we would have had more time to stop back in and try some other items! It's a must visit if you are heading to la sagrada familia one morning!",
