    "Now I'm not saying this place was bad but...I've eaten at 25 different places in Spain and liked about 99% of what I've eaten. \u00a0On the other hand I ordered three things at Tapeo that were all pretty much gross. \u00a0 Let's start with the pan con tomate which seemed as though a copious amount of sugar had poured on to it. \u00a0How a \u00a0restaurant in Spain could screw up this simple dish I don't know. \u00a0Moving on to marinated mackerel which was nothing more than a soup of gelatinous sauce over a minuscule \u00a0amount of fish. \u00a0Skip this spot.",
