    "Very nice. Great view from the patio that sits above the quiet square. I had the pork ribs which and wife had the seafood paella, \u00a0both were very delicious. \u00a0Had the tiramisu and assorted ice creams for dessert. \u00a0Very tasty. Service started off as attentive but fell down in the end. \u00a0Ordered another bottle of wine and after 20 minutes of waiting were told they didn't have that bottle, ran out. \u00a0I would still recommend.",
