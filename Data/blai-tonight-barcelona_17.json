    "I almost don't want to tell you about Taberna Blai, because there were no tourists in there, and that's part of what made it so magical, like X-topher said. \u00a0The snacks were fresh and delicious and the honor system was a nice change.... So, you go, you get a plate and then you just pick the snacks you want as they are constantly putting out new ones - \u00a0and at the end, they count up your toothpicks and that's what you're charged. My favorite snack was avocado with fresh tomatoes and roe on toast. Yum. But, all of the ones we tried so were good!My advice: practice your Spanish and strike up a convo with the locals, don't look like a damn tourist, get an estrella con limon to drink, and try one of everything... maybe twice. And last but not least, don't tell anyone about this place on TripAdvisor, PLEASE. Ok?",
