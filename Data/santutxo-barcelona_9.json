    "This is the one of the best hamburgers I've ever tried!!! Chef Isma only use organic/free ranged grown beef for the petty, and the taste is just fantastic!!!! Bun is crisp, and simple lettuce/tomato make your mouth feel so heavenly. If you like the food with good fresh materials, this is the 'must'!!!",
