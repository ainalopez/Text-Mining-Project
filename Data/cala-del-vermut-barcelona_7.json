    "Despite staying in the general area and walking around for a couple days, I would never have found this place if it hadn't been a stop on the Barcelona Taste tour. \u00a0Solid tapas, but the real winner is the housemade Vermut - definitely a must have. \u00a0 Great place with a nice local feel.",
