    "Seafood paella was way too salty. Not impressed with tapas dishes. Food came out literally in one minute which I don't like cause that means it's been sitting waiting on patrons. No one was in restaurant. Croquet was okay. The garlic shrimp was floating in grease. Overall regret wasting my appetite/money on this meal.",
