    "Many of my reviews rely on the overall experience to come to a final rating. \u00a0but I was sick when I went here and it was STILL exceptional.The design of the place was HOT!The cocktails were HOT!The food was HOT!The workers/uniforms were HOT!41 Degrees is kick butt and at the top of the worlds game right now.I hear that you must now have a reservation to get in. \u00a0When we went, it was first come, first serve. \u00a0That added a little extra adventure to the evening and when we walked out the front door there was quite a long line.Get there.",
