    "Yet another win for a Yelp search! Yeah Yelp!!Wandering around El Gotic and yanked out the phone for a quick search for tapas in the area. This was #1 and I suspect for good reason. Great atmosphere, nice setting and excellent service and of course food. Blood pudding to die for (unless you're the pig I guess), and the sardines with homemade tomato sauce were fantastic. Prices rocked too.",
