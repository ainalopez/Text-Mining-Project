    "A Hidden Gem. \u00a0We were directed to Gorria from a friend who works in the area. \u00a0We were in the mood for great steaks after 2 weeks of mostly seafood and tapas. \u00a0Gorria butchers their own meat and cooks it to perfection. \u00a0This place has been here for a long time and it gets packed with locals. \u00a0Great wine list and best service we had in Barcelona... the waiters all look to be in their 60s, 70s and some even older, but they are obvious in their love and enjoyment of their careers",
