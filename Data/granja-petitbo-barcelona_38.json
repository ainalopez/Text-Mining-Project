    "Hands down, my favorite brunch in Barcelona (yes, I liked it even better than Federal Caf\u00e9, which is slightly overcrowded these days). They have got a wide selection of egg dishes, sandwiches, fresh juice, and also plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. Everything is fresh, organic and just delicious! The ambiance is great, and that big window with the view on the busy Passeig de Sant Joan is a top spot! The service is also very nice, attentive and quick, even though the place gets busy really quick. I am definitely returning to this place when back in Barcelona.",
