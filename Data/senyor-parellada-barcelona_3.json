    "This is a nice sit down restaurant in the popular barrio gotico neighborhood. The atmosphere is romantic and the restaurant itself feels upscale. Unfortunately I wasn't too impressed by the food. I had the beef fillet which I found to be quite tough and not very flavorful and my husband had the monkfish which he said was rubbery. The service was pretty good, although not many of their staff spoke English. All in all I would say I enjoyed the experience but the food was not worth the 80\u20ac spent.",
