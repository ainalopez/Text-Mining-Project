    "On our last night in Barcelona, we managed to get a table at Arume (even though it was St. Jordi's day and the city was packed)! What a cute place Arume is; quaint and cozy, with a very interesting decor! We knew we could have our table for two hours and that was plenty of time to enjoy a fabulous meal at this restaurant. We tried two different kinds of paella and they were both fabulous. They make a fine sangria too. The service was impeccable. We found out that it was our server's first day at the restaurant but she was so professional and friendly, you would imagine she had been part of the establishment forever. Glad we got a chance to try Restaurante Arume. I should mention that we had to make the reservation through e-mail. They were responsive and the process was easy.",
