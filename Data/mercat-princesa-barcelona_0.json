    "After spending four consecutive summers in Barcelona, I was bummed to find this place during the last week of my fourth summer... but better late than never.What I love about this place is you can choose what you want to eat and how much you want to spend. It's like a food flea-market, if you will, and the quality is outstanding! Many stands of various Catalan cuisines (Italian & Sushi as well). You go around the marketplace, select and pay for each dish separately, and then go to a table with your friends and dine; or you make new friends who may be other patrons sitting next to you. Even the wine has its own stand, and this of course means it is sold at market price (not restaurant menu price). I absolutely love this place. Did not find one tourist! Oops, I hope I haven't let the cat out of the bag...",
