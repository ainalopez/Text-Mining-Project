    "Let me start by saying that my husband is a picky eater... We randomly came across this restaurant on an evening stroll for dinner. The atmosphere was inviting and since it was a little chilly for us, we chose a table inside. Every off-white stained plank table is a canvas for whimsical hand sketches/paintings of food-related items. There was music in a club downstairs that provides nice background without being too loud. The cabinet showing the delicious-looking meats indicated that they want to be know for their steaks, but we chose four appetizers, as that was what we were looking for. EVERY bite was delicious, starting with the bread with a perfectly seasoned olive oil. We ordered Avocado stuffed with shrimp and \"pico de gallo,\" (even though I hate cilantro and am afraid of pico de gallo, I even loved that!), Fried Artichokes, (who'd ever dreamed how delicious that would be?), Figs stuffed with fresh cheese and chives, wrapped in bacon with spinach background, (a lovely \"sweet\" bite), and scallops wrapped in bacon with mint cream and grilled endive (the mint was a new twist for us-wonderful!). For dessert we had chocolate chunk ice cream and tiramisu, both heavenly! \u00a0With two bottles of water and two glasses of house red wine, our bill was 41,90 EU. \u00a0We will be coming back!",
