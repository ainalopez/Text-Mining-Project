    "one of my favorite tapas places in barcelona! The pica pica menu is a great option and they will bring out popular tapas for however many people you want plus drinks. The sangria de cava is amazing, and the service is so friendly. Its a great atmosphere, and there is a lot of space! We had grilled mussels that were huge and juicy, with such a good flavor. The clams were also a favorite dish. We had some baisc such as pimientos de padron, jamon ib\u00e9beric, plato de queso, calamares a la romana, and patatas bravas that were all great. I've had a lot more stuff here in the past and its all been great. Top it of with an espresso and a crema catalana for dessert. Wish I was in Barcelona now to go eat here, because talking about this place is making my mouth water!",
