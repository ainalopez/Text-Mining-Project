    "super crowded bar where you stand and eat, inexpensive, but knowing what to order not that easy. \u00a0some friendly locals shared some cured meat, and we managed to procure a chorizo and jamon, queso, cebolla, pimiento bocadillos para llevar. \u00a0great chorizo flavor, tasted like stuff I had in MIA frequently.",
