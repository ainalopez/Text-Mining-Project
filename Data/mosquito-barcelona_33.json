    "Really didn't like this place, even though I desperately wanted a decent asian restaurant. \u00a0I had a few dumplings, both were extremely watery and flavorless. \u00a0I had their Thai Fish dish, the sauce was really nice but the fish was extremely boney.Mostly though I just didn't see anything on the menu that looked good anyway. \u00a0So have no reason to even give them a second chance.",
