    "This was a great little tapas place. We went with the waiter's recommendations and particularly enjoyed the beef skewers, grilled artichokes and white fish. Serving sizes were good, and the staff were extremely friendly. The atmosphere was busy and happy - overall the experience was very enjoyable!",
