    "Very convenient near the Barceloneta metro. \u00a0I came here with my Local friend, and we ordered the namesake burger, which was tender and delicious, worthy of burger eaters anywhere. \u00a0They also had some great home-brewed beers and a good beer cocktail selection. \u00a0My friend had the Smoking Hops and thoroughly enjoyed it.Didn't try the Asian side of the Asian American menu, but highly recommend for burgers and beers!",
