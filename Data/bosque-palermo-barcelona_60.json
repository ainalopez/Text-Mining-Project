    "Amazing food, service and location! \u00a0Little mom and pop shop a few blocks off La Ramblas and only 10 minute walk from hotel (mirror mirror). \u00a0I had the best Paella ever , shared with Hubbie for $10 euro each. \u00a0The house wine was delicious. \u00a0Salad and another shared starter and bill was $50 Euro. \u00a0 Highly recommended.",
