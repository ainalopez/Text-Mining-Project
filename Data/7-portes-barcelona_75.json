    "My boyfriend booked this for Valentine's Day so that we could try the Rich man's Paella which has black rice (squid ink?) instead of the typical yellow rice. \u00a0The restaurant has nice ambiance and the service is good but the paella was just...okay. \u00a0As mentioned in other reviews, there wasn't much seafood in our paella. \u00a0I would probably suggest another place.",
