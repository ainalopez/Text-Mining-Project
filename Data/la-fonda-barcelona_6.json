    "We came here one night after seeing a long line of people outside thinking that it must be good. Here's a breakdown of our dinner:Service: 1/5 they weren't very helpful and unfriendly immediately upon entering. It took over 30 minutes to get our bill after asking for it. The wine glasses and utensils were visibly dirty as well. Food: 1/5 we ordered a bottle of wine which was alright. We had patatas Bravas which were really poor. It seemed as if they had cooked it a few hours ago and left it under a heat lamp until it was ordered. We also had some pan con tomate where the bread was incredibly stale. Lastly, we had some Valencia paella which was just okay. The meat was very dry and the rice was hard at times. We did not finish a single thing that we ordered because it was so bad. Atmosphere -- 3/5 the lighting is bad in some places, and it is very very touristy. There was a good amount of noise. This was about the only thing that the place had going. Overall, I would not recommend this place at all. I hope that you read the reviews rather than look at the line like we did. Avoid at all costs.",
