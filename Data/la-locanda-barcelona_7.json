    "I went here the other night with my family, a total of six people. We were looking for something simple and tasty, quick and easy for the entire family as we were all tired after a long day. \"La Locanda\" definitely fit the bill as we were nicely greeted at the front door and sat right away at a nice table in the back. We were attended to by our waiter who was from Italy, but spoke English & Spanish with no issues at all. We all ordered some appetizers, pizzas, and a few main courses. All of the food was better than average, but nothing that stood out as spectacular, just good. The flavors were good and the quality of the food was also good. Overall it is a nice place to go to, good service, good food, and definitely a step up from the typical \"Tapas\" tourist food that you find all over Barcelona. I would recommend this place for a simple meal that you can rely upon, and when you need to go somewhere but just can't decide.",
