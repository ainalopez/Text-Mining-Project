    "Great brunch place! It's right next to Milk and normally has a shorter wait time. That being said, if you go on a Sunday afternoon, there could well be a 30-60min wait. The interior decor has an English theme and is quite cute! Their brunch set menu is \u20ac16.9 (I think) including a main plate, 2 drinks(1 coffee/tea and 1 alcoholic) and 1 dessert. You can always order from the menu which has more choices. Their eggs Benedict is quite good and the pancakes are so fluffy! If you're in Barcelona and craving brunch, this could do it!",
