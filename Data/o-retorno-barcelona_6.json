    "Looks rough on the outside, but don't be fooled, the seafood was absolutely delicious for a good price. We went on a weekday night so there was no wait for a table. \u00a0If you like seafood, you should check this place out. Make sure you are hungry if you order the seafood platter for 2, because its ALOT of fresh seafood. loved it. Be sure to go on a weekday night if you can so its less busy.",
