    "We ate here twice on our 4 day trip to Barcelona. \u00a0My wife and I have been slowly trying to go vegetarian -- if we had a restaurant like this back in ATL we'd already be there. \u00a0The dishes are so creative you don't notice the lack of meat - I suspect even meat lovers could be swayed by this place. \u00a0Great space and good atmosphere.",
