    "Searching for a spot to grab a late breakfast Brunch & Cake came up. The reviews looked great - and the photos even better!I will start by saying: Beware of the photos! Everything we ordered look extremely different than they used to. I went with the ham and eggs and it looked totally different. It was basically a completely new dish and instead of a ton of slices of ham on the side they now had the ham ripped up and mixed in with the egg....not what I was expecting. So much so that I honestly thought they brought the wrong dish. I tried to flag server down multiple times...and eventually had to get up and go grab him inside. When he finally came over he looked at me like I was crazy and told me that it was the same dish - but it had just changed. I showed him the beautiful photo....and then compared it to the less beautiful plate I had in front of me and he just shrugged.....the dish had changed.The rye bread was super soggy. The eggs were alright but there certainly wasn't enough ham in there for me.Sat outside in a makeshift windowsill turned bench. You can see it in the photos. Luckily this hasn't changed ;DNow to the good part. The cappuccino was great. Like really good. And since we were technically sitting outside, and it was chilly out.... it was ready to drink as soon as they placed it down.Overall I left super disappointed and this was one of the only meals that I wasn't super excited by while in Barcelona. I might of just ordered the wrong thing, but the service was also horrible, as they were super understaffed and it took forever to have our server come by for stuff like getting silverware or explaining that I might have the wrong dish.",
