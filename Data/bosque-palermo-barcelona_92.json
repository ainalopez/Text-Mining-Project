    "Fantastic paella!!! Came here during our honeymoon and my wife's birthday and it did not disappoint. Seafood was fresh, rice wasn't sticking to the bottom of the pot, and the sangria was on point!!! Small spot, but well worth it if you come here. Love the little tap they have when they pour sangria into the pitcher. Loved the prices for the entire meal. Can get a paella for 2 for 20 euros. Got that, an appetizer, sangria and water for less than 40 euros.",
