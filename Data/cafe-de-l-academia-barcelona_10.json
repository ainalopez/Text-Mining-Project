    "One of the best meals I've had anywhere in the world. I was a little nervous about its location in the crowded gothic quarter, but this was tucked away on a stunning little street that was pretty devoid of tourist nonsense. This made it a little hard to find! I recommend arriving a bit early for the reservations you ought to make, so you can wander the lovely side streets and find the unassuming entrance. When we arrived, we were seated outside, and enjoyed the gorgeous ambience (and the great street musicians). We ordered four dishes between us and a bottle of wine, and each was fantastic. The foie gras toasts were to-die-for, the cod was succulent. This meal would've cost, probably, $300 in NYC and we paid a third of that, which made this even more terrific.",
