    "After trying to dodge a number of tourist places, we stumbled upon this little gem to finish off a night in Barcelona. Loved the atmosphere and the waitress was very kind to try and speak to us in English. She was able to recommend a local craft beer and some delicious tapas. We tried the croquetas, which were good. The one that we would come back fro again again would have been the baked goat cheese with tomato marmalade. Between this and a couple of drinks, this is a great little way to top off an evening in Barcelona.",
