    "To the rhythms of The Black Keys and Amy Winehouse one begins their experience at \"Marmalade\". Named after the the fruit preserve made with juice and peel, this hidden gem of Barcelona boasts a wide arrange of mixed cocktails and beers on tap. The restaurant is set in a SOHO-esque style. The indie modular cube seating and lovely polished wooden tables enhance the lounge interior. If that doesn't suite your pallet, there's lovely outdoor seating in the nook of a neighborhood square.Although known for it's flawless brunch menu (Eggs Benedict is a local favorite), my party decided to venture out for a lovely candlelight dinner for about \u20ac12 each. All burgers are cooked medium rare with fresh beef supplied by a family run Boqueria butcher. The fries cooked twice over pair nicely. The Messi is a personal favorite. The wings seasoned with a the lounge's secret recipe are outstanding as well. All in all the atmosphere, food, and polished experience will make you regret not coming back for seconds.",
