    "An awesome vegetarian restaurant. The tomato risotto was amazing as was the veggie tower with goat cheese. Only downer was that the fruit juices come in a bottle- we were expecting freshly squeezed. A real gem packed with locals. We ordered too much food so did not have room for a sweet tooth, but it looked great",
