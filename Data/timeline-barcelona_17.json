    "Fantastic find. \u00a0I came here looking for a light snack and got exactly that: bravas (potatoes) with salsa and a tasty garlic sauce. \u00a0The price was unbelievably low: 5,50 EUR for that and a litre of beer. Add to this the extremely friendly guy running the place and wow what a nice experience.",
