    "A lot of friends recommended this place, and I have to say although it didn't look as I expected, it was very satisfying. The waitstaff are fun and wonderful. Went with no reservations and waited for seats at the bar. There is no menu, they just bring food out. The clams in wine sauce are super delicious and the lemon beer has a nice interesting taste. Glad I got to try this place out and will recommend to friends.",
