    "One of the best restaurants I have \u00a0ever been to in BCN. This is a not a tourist trap and the food and price is great. And the view from the highway leading up to the bar is one of the best in the city. This is the place the locals go to.I recommend the following:Patatas bravas: great sauce and great spuds. Mejellones: Simply the best I have had in Spain. They are HUGE and the garlic limon sauce is excellent. This plate alone is worth coming for.jamon serrano: this is a platter that comes with cheese, great plate.Calimare: not too greasy, large portions, solid choiceThe food is for sharing and it is great for large groups. The seating outside is nice but on weekends and evenings you'll have to wait.The best way to get here is via taxi, the hill going up is steep, it is not so bad going down hill though.",
