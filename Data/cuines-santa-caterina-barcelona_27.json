    "Great stop for lunch or dinner. Fast service and good food. It's located in the food market at Santa Catarina near the El Born district. They offer varieties of hot and cold food from all over the world. The portions are large and can be shared between two persons. Can recommend the hamburger, provolone cheese and sea bream.",
