    "After reading other reviews before coming to Barcelona, 336 Restaurant stood out. Why you might ask? Where can you get a 3 course meal (plus house wine & glass of champagne to start the meal) for 27 Euro. The first course was blood sausage. The blood sausage was on a bed of dark, bed of black rice and other flavor topped off by a pimiento padron Pepper. It was very good!The second was the lamb shoulder with potatoes and pimiento padron peppers. Normally I don't mind a nice portion, yet between the 1st 2 courses, it was plenty of food! The lam shoulder was cooked perfectly.The third and last course was the pineapple carpaccio with saffron and vanilla ice cream. The pineapple is exactly a carpaccio, very thin topped off with a skin of saffron on top of vanilla ice cream. The portion was perfect, very light and a nice cleansing of the palate. The service was fine as I was the first person in for dinner. No issue with the staff whatsoever. Plus rarely had to wait between courses. Also, the waitress was very helpful helping me \"refined\" my Spanish!The total bill came to 27 Euro (including 1/2 liter of sparkling water). Very reasonable (and cheap, IMO) for the value of the meal. Definitely recommend this place!",
