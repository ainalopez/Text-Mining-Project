    "I'll try to keep this short and sweet, unlike the service at this bar. \u00a0The bar is decorated nicely with a lot of fake antique Americana. \u00a0It's a cool looking place for a sports buff. \u00a0Even though my traveling friend and I are from California and are used to being patient at a busy establishment, we were swiftly schooled with slow inattentive service while in France. \u00a0We get it. \u00a0However, this place takes the cake for the worst service/employees we've ever had the displeasure to encounter. \u00a0The tall douchey guy with a shaved head was pretty much a prick the whole time except while he was trying to hook up with a sleazy local girl. \u00a0We tried ordering our second round of beers a few times with no luck despite less than 10 other people in the entire establishment. \u00a0He was busy either high-fiving his co-worker or on the phone with, whom must have been his BFF. \u00a0After about 20 minutes, we decided to settle our check. \u00a0With a rude attitude from the \"bartender\" we were on our way. \u00a0If you happen to be in the neighborhood, do yourself a favor and keep walking or tell the cab driver to take you somewhere else. \u00a0I truly feel bad for the owner of this bar. \u00a0We are going to be in Barcelona for 3 more nights and, despite being right around the corner from this place, wouldn't go back even if the drinks were free! \u00a0 There are plenty of other good ones around this city. \u00a0If I could give negative stars for the service, I'd have left a worse review. \u00a0Good luck!",
