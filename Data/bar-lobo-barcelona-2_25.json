    "Bar lobo was suggested to me and my friend by the shop owner of grey street which was right up the same road a bit as the restuarant. Im happy Amiee suggested it cuz it was a beautiful establishment, reasonable in price and very good tapas. Me and my friend split the patatas bravas, friend artichoke and friend eggplant with honey as well as the quinoa salad. It was more than enough food. If i had to pick a favorite the eggplant and patatas bravas were exceptional in flavor. We also shared a pitcher of sangria which was also very flavorful and worth splitting the pitcher over per glass. I would definitely suggest Bar lobo to anyone visiting the area",
