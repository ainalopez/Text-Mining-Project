    "The first time my friends brought me to this restaurant I though it would be the typical vegan restaurant and that I couldn't eat anything because all the menu was \"too veggie\"... But when i read the menu I couldn't decide what to choose!! All was amazing and sounded reeeeally good. It's not an expensive place and it's perfect for going with friends or boyfriend.",
