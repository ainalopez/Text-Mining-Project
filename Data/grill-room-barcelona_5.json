    "Went for food here tonight, after walking past it a the night before when it was bustling. On Monday around 21:00 we were one of three couple in the restaurant, and we were seated quickly, although I think forgotten about as we were around the corner from the bar (a fourth couple came in around 5 minutes after us and we're served and fed starters before our order was taken) Once our orders were taken we were quickly served. We ordered the Grill Burger (comes with egg, bacon and cheese) and the Californian Burger we could choose how well cooked we wanted the burger which is always a plus and sign the burgers would be good, we weren't disappointed, food was excellent quality and the burger patties were thick and juicy, only slight whinge would be the the amount of fries that came with it, not a great amount be more than enough for my wife and I'm a big eater so I'll let them off. I finished off the meal with the chocolate brownie which was also very good. Total bill for two burgers, litre of sangria and brownie 34 euros. Would have been 5 stars but the service wasn't the greatest.",
