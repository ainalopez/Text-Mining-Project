    "Service is terribly slow and incredibly unfriendly. Tapas are ok, but definitely far from excellent. Besides the portions are just ridiculous for the prices! I have been here twice only because I thought may be the first time we did not chose the right items. But no,still not worth the money. Definitely \u00a0better than tourist traps along Paseo de Joan Borbo,but nevertheless nothing special.",
