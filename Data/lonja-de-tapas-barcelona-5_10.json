    "Came here twice, the first time was because it was the only place open after 4pm and we were starving... We found the tapas to be delicious (see pics). Calamari, pasta tags bravas, beans with chorizo and pan con tomate... Yum! Great service and drink selection, they make a good sangria and mojito too. Also, FYI they take Discover card which wasn't easy to find (Discover card doesn't charge you the 3%conversion). The second time we had a prefix lunch, it was mostly good but not as good as the tapas, price was good and came with delish cava. They also have a lot of room for big parties if you need. The location is super convenient, right nearby the Picasso museum.",
