    "The Granja Petitbo is a lovely hangout with yummy food and a nice ambiance. \u00a0The wooden tables laden with great magazines, the worn-in leather furniture and the warm staff all contribute to a relaxed atmosphere that's perfect for a morning cortado and croissant. \u00a0If you're looking for something a bit heartier I think it's pretty hard to go wrong; the burgers and sandwiches are delicious, salads fresh and the full breakfast/brunch menu is satisfying and well presented.A good spot to grab a table and read or socialize with friends, in my opinion the best time to do so is on a weekday morning or early afternoon when the place is much less busy than at Sunday brunch but equally enjoyable. \u00a0Laid-back vibes, fresh food and excellent juices make for a reliable lunch or breakfast any day of the week.",
