    "Japanese fast food made simple. When you first get in, you need to buy a ticket using a touch screen then give it to the waiter to retrieve your food. The food itself is nothing special, but daily menus during weekdays start as low as 8\u20ac. Expect acceptable yakisoba and the common sushi varieties such as salmon and tuna. All menus come with a starter, the salad is good.",
