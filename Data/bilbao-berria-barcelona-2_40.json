    "Bilbao Berria sits inconspicuously behind the Catedral de Barcelona. The restaurant is midsized, bright and open. \u00a0Seating is intimate and cozy, although it can get tight if you're with a group. You can eat at the bar if there are no tables available. The tapas is semi vegetarian friendly and delicious, but a tad bit pricey at 1,65 Euros. I gorged on egg salad, roasted vegetables, tomato/mozzarella/olives and rice pudding for 18 Euros + \u00a0glass of red wine - 2 EurosThe only reason I docked two stars is because the veg options are pedestrian and can be made at home for a fraction of the cost. Meat lovers will fare better here as those selections are plentiful and much more creative. Credit cards are accepted, although it is best to have cash. They don't split checks so things can get a bit hairy if you're with a group. This is where cash comes in handy.",
