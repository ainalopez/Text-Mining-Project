    "My friend and I came here for lunch at the recommendation of a friend. Let's get right down to the problems: Both entrees were botched and the maitre d' handled it abhorrently. My turbot had exceedingly hard, scale-like material on the skin. I was told this was a \"par\u00e1sito\" that lives naturally on the skin of the fish. Firstly, there is no \"parasito\" or symbiotic creature of turbots that I've found on google. Yeah, I googled it. Secondly, a restaurant of this caliber should know how to prepare their fish. I realize everyone makes mistakes and I would have been happy had they owned up to it. Instead they offered excuses, and then tried to convince me to order a different entree. After an unnecessarily long debate, the chef finally decides to send out another entree, sans skin. Seriously? Are you that doubtful of your own ability to prepare fish?My friends veal was a horrific cut littered with inedible tendons throughout. After the way the maitre d' handled my entree, she decides just to excise the tendinous parts.Also, the dessert \"strawberries and cream\" had three strawberry halves. It was mostly strawberry jello that wasn't even that good.Please see uploaded photos. Sadly I didn't take a close up showcasing the botched fish, only the skinless one.We had way better at Alkimia and Sauc.",
