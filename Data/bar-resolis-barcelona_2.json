    "My husband and I decided to check out this bar since it was recommended in the Barcelona Rough Guide and it was OK. It wasn't great but it wasn't awful. The service was fine, it is like your typical bar. The tapas was not that great either, we ordered the chicken croquetas and the octopus salad. Chicken croquestas were stuffed with ground chicken and a lot of corn while the octopus salad was very salty with extra vinegar that made it sour and salty at the same time. We had an Amstel beer with a glass of cava. Decent but not awesome place. Also, not in the safest area, watch out for the hoodlums \u00a0that bump into you and try to pick your pockets.",
