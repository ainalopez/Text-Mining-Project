    "Thank you for a wonderful experience Montiel. Went there last night as I booked for my husbands birthday. We ordered the 10 course gastronomic tasting menu and we were blown away. Every dish that came out in front of us was outstanding. The waiters and staff are very knowledgable about every dish and explained what it was and where it came from. The staff even organized a small birthday cake and sung happy birthday to my husband which topped off the night for us. Value wise, \u20ac68 for a 10 course tasting menu is absolutely fair. They also have wine pairing which was at \u20ac30 per person which we did not opt to have and got a bottle of red wine instead starting from \u20ac26. My only critique would be that the portion size was just a tad too much as we were left with a very full belly! (Not totally a bad thing though, as everything was delicious) I did my research of degustation restaurants in Barcelona prior to booking Montiel and nothing was comparable to value/service and quality of food. Amazed! A must try when visiting Barcelona! You won't be disappointed :)",
