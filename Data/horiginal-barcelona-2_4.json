    "We found this homey restaurant two years ago on a trip to Barcelona. \u00a0Back again this year and found same welcoming spirit and good food. \u00a0Maurice treated us well and we felt very welcome. \u00a0Had paella and prawns and a nice nutty bean salad. \u00a0All complimented by a pleasant Martin C\u00f3dax blanco wine. \u00a0Finished it all off with a nicely done Spanish Creme Carmel. \u00a0It is worth a visit!",
