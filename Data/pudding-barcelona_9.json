    "This place is absolutely adorable! The interior is reminiscent of Alice and Wonderland. Everything from the chairs, wall art, and lights add to the whimsicality of the place.I ordered a slice of carrot cake and an affogato. The cake was moist and delicious. I couldn't finish it and had to take it home, because it was such a huge slice! It was my first time having an affogato. Why haven't I had an affogato before?! The vanilla ice cream didn't mask the espresso at all. It was so good that I attempted to make it every day for a week after I got home. Obviously, it wasn't nearly as good as Pudding's. This place was such an experience. If you get the chance, you should to come here, and if you have kids, you should definitely take the kids here!",
