    "Absolutely deserves a five star review. The food here is all \"a la minut\" which means if you order rice it will take 20 minutes, as noted on the menu. We started with a salad that included pumpkin and watermelon - refreshing and delicious. I had the fish of the day (sea breem) which was perfectly cooked; my wife had smoked rice which she loved. We ended with tiramisu which we had without the ladyfingers (my wife is gluten intolerant).The staff is wonderful - attentive to your needs and cheerful to serve you. Foodies - don't miss this one!",
