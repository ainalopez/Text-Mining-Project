    "The cheapest not-terrible-almost-pizza in Barca!At 1.90 euros a slice, you're not going to do any better for your money. They also have a metric ton of choices available, and I've never seen them run low.To say it gets packed inside is an understatement, so if you're with amigos and staying, send forth an emissary to get all the slices and avoid the bottleneck that occurs between the slices in the back and the register that's only about two feet away.",
