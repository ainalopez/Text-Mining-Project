    "So far, 3 days in Barcelona and 3 times eating here. Excellent tapas, home style food, nice staff, great ambience. Don't expect fancy but pure Spanish style. We tried the Paella, Onion soup, Escalopa de lomo, canelones rellenos, even the bolonegse spaghetti my kids ordered was so good!!! And the Sangria!! Excellent. Going back for the Paella con Sepia (black paella). Sunday is a full house over there. Coffee is really good (and I only drink very good coffee) Desserts are very traditional: crema catalana (very similar to creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e ), cheese cake (nothing like the American version. This is lighter and I bet it contains gelatin. It was delicious) Pudin (contains bread, more like bread pudding but less sweet) And they serve the best Jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico de Bellota brand you can find in Barcelona.",
