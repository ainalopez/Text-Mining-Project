    "Found this place on TA when planning out our shopping day in Barcelona. One of the few that have a gluten sensitive menu and that's open on a Sunday. The restaurant has amazing style and flair. Very upscale/modern beach house style. Service was very solid and the good was pretty good. Bigger portions than expected which put me in a food coma 15 mins later. All and all a great place to have lunch and a must visit if in the area.",
