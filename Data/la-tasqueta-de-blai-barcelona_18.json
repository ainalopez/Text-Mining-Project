    "My favorite pintxos bar in Barcelona! Located on a street of similar restaurants, this one really sticks out! From its simple and well designed decor to its ample display of pinchos. Everytime I have gone throughout the day, it has always been busy, if not packed! 1\u20ac for each pinchos and ca\u00f1a is a super deal. I don't always know what's on the stick, but it never disappoints!",
