    "This is deservedly the top rated tapas bar in BCN on yelp. Food and atmosphere are 5 stars. I've gone at least 4 times on 2 separate trips to BCN. This place is off the beaten tourist path, located in a residential part of the Eixample neighborhood. With the acclaim it gets on Yelp and Trip Advisor, I'm surprised it's not more crowded with tourists.You walk in and are seized by the somewhat kitschy over the top Catalunyan decor. You wonder if you made a mistake but you take a few more steps and hear nothing but Spanish and Catalan. Okay, that's better. You'll see a huge array of cold and hot tapas laid out on the counter. Grab a stool at the counter and get ready to eat. I feel as though the bar counter or the stand-up area against the walls are the best places to eat. You're shoulder to shoulder with the other customers, most of whom are locals. It feels fun and lively. The back room is great too, but it doesn't have quite the same atmosphere. Back to the tapas. Pick whatever you like and load your plate up (but go slowly - I'll get to why in a moment). The tapas are speared with a toothpick, and they charge you at the end of your meal by how many toothpicks you've taken. Get a glass of vino tinto, take in your surroundings, and enjoy.Earlier I said to go slowly. Please listen to this advice, because you will see many, many more tapas coming out fresh from the kitchen. They have at least a few dozen varieties on the menu, and they just keep coming. You'll want to save yourself! My faves are the leek croquette and artichoke heart croquette. Finally, finish your meal with a shot of Patxaran, a Basque sloe berry liqueur.Voila! You're local now.",
