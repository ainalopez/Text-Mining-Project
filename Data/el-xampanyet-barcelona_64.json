    "Great place to go for carquinyolis (Spanish version of biscotti) and a glass of moscatel (Spanish dessert wine, similar to Italian vin santo or French sauternes), although this is a great tapas place. Order your carquinyolis and a glass of moscatel; dip the carquinyolis into the sweet wine and savor. You won't be disappointed.",
