    "As good as it gets folks for Barcelona! We (my fiance and I) ate there the first time during x-mas season 2013 and again in March 2014. The staff is super friendly and very eager to explain menu which changes on a daily basis. My fiance is a Barcelona native and she too was smitten with this restaurant. Food - from tapas, seafood, fish, meats \u00a0- you just cannot go wrong. Last time I was there the entrecote - cooked to perfection (well with good amount of blood to my liking) was simply divine !!! Octupus and tuna were also stupidly good this last time out. We were a group of 10 and all were left foaming at the mouth ! Highly recommended to any visitors and Barcelona natives alike.",
