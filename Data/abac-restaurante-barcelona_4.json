    "The food, service, and space were all very nice, four stars probably, but not particularly memorable. We had a drink on the deck before dinner and that space was both high-end and warm, contrasted with the cold and uninviting formal dinning room. The room was well appointed but incredibly quiet and we almost felt as if we were imposing by speaking. For two Michelin stars and a price of \u20ac200 per person I can't provide more than three stars to ABaC.",
