    "This place cured my crepe craving. The waitress, was super sweet, especially while I don't speak Spanish, I still felt comfortable and welcomed.Super cute restaurant, with about 5 or 6 tables. I ordered a simple cheese crepe topped with arugala. I got a mint tea, which wasn't the tea I ordered, but that was neither here nor there for me. Still good :)Crepe, is a great size, perfect texture and thinness. Just wonderful, and a nice experience overall. I may go back once more, before leaving back to the States.",
