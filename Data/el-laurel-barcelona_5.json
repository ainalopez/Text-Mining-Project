    "Perfect spot for a casual dinner before or after a movie. \u00a0It's an Argentinian restaurant, where the menu consists of empanadas (all around 2,50 euros), pizzas, salads, and other stuff that i didn't really look at. \u00a0we ordered a bunch of empanadas to sample and split, and a goat cheese salad. \u00a0My favorite of the empanadas was the \"Brown\" one... it was a duck empanada - with other flavors mixed in... it was so good that when it came time for the desserts, Marc ordered his regular cocoanut dessert, but Peter & I each ordered the duck empanada as our dessert. \u00a0so between the 3 of us, it came to 53 euros, including the bottle of wine (plus another glass) a salad and 8 empanadas. \u00a0Fair enough. \u00a0I've given up on giving ratings based on service. \u00a0It sucks. \u00a0I'm getting used to it. \u00a0If I was to factor it in, I'd deduct a star... But the food was really good, the setting was cute/bright and charming - and i think they have a tuesday dinner and a movie pricing special. \u00a0I wasn't quite paying attention. \u00a0No matter... I'll be back.",
