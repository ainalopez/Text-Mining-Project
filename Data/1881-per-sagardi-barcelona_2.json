    "We had a lovely evening at this restaurant. Situated inside the Catalan History Museum, the restaurant features a rooftop terrace that overlooks the harbor and the city. \u00a0The farmhouse tomatoes appetizer was my favorite. \u00a0We also enjoyed the grilled vegetables, cannelloni, chicken, and fresh fish and shared everything for our family of four. \u00a0it was the perfect amount of food that left us satisfied but not overly full. \u00a0Terrific, memorable meal with great atmosphere and views.",
