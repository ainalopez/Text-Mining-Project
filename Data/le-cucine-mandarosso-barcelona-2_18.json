    "This small family restaurant is tucked away in a quaint passageway near the Gothic quarter. \u00a0We had lunch there, and it was very good. \u00a0My fondest memory of our meal was the dessert, which was incredible. \u00a0Desserts are made daily, and the white chocolate cheesecake (with preserved cherries) was a knockout. \u00a0 Check out the dessert case on the counter to start your mouth watering. \u00a0 Prices are very reasonable. .",
