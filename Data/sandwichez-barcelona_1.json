    "Wow. Everything was perfect. From the decor (wooden floors, tall ceilings, trendy lighting) to the ambience (light blues music, wooden chairs n tables, lots of natural light) to the sandwiches (the falafel was great!), the coffee and the service. theres also free wifi - just make sure to ask the cashier for a pin code. theres also plenty of seating upstairs. ill definitely be coming back here with my laptop to work.",
