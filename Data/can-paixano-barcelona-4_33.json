    "How could we not try this place after all these fabulous reviews? Here's my take: the little sandwich they recommend to everyone is quite tasty. Everything we had was good and the service was very friendly! It has a nice vibe, kind of hectic and fun with everyone drinking cava and standing around each other talking loudly. Here's the thing: I wouldn't go there again. Once was enough and I say that mostly because they aren't offering anything too different from other restaurants in the city. The prices are great - no doubt about that - but I wasn't blown away.",
