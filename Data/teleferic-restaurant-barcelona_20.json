    "Finally landed in Barcelona and was famished! \u00a0My sister and I headed to this popular spot that was highly recommended by someone who lived in the area. \u00a0To our great surprise, this restaurant was one of the most memorable restaurant experiences we had in Barcelona. \u00a0The array of food selection and creativity in their dishes will keep you wanting to come for more. \u00a0To top off the experience, the retaurant's hospitality is above par in Barcelona. \u00a0You'll feel so warm and welcomed at this place that it will fool you to believe that this is how it's always is in Barcelona restaurants and service industry. \u00a0However, you'll soon find out that not all Barcelona restaurants tend to their customers like Teleferic. \u00a0Come vist and find out for yourself.",
