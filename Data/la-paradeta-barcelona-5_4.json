    "Great seafood concept! Loved the fresh seafood they serve here. Our party ordered a lot of seafood and could not finish everything but were very satisfied. We ordered: 1) Calamari 2) Gambas a la planche 3) Lobster4) Crab Salad5) Clams6) Razor claims 7) OystersHonestly, I think anything you order here will be good but my favorites were the gambas, lobster and razor clams. The garlic sauce they put on the seafood is to die for. This place gets packed so we got there right when it opened at 8pm and we were the first people there. By the time we left an hour later, there was a line going out the door.",
