    "Wow! Some of the very best food and by far the best bargain easy on the traveler wallet deal in all of Barcelona.Delicious lamb chops, cuts of meat, mussels and all kinds of assorted food can be found at this \"all you can eat\" buffet. It's a foodies dream come true and at a bargain of a price. Located near the university it is usually packed with a younger heavy eating group so the buffet food turns over quickly.Compared to the prices elsewhere, this is a bargain, particularly considering the quality of food which would go for three times as much anywhere else and you'd get less of it.",
