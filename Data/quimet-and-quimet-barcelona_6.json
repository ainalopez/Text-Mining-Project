    "When I die, bury me at Quimet & Quimet. This little storefront tapas mecca was suggested by one of my most trusted foodie friends, so I knew I had to make a stop (it's apparently one of Ferran Adri\u00e0's faves too). Did I think I would end up there every day of my vacation in Barcelona? Definitely not. It helped that my Airbnb was right down the street, but lemme tell you: next time I make it to the greatest food city on the planet, I'll be staying nearby again, on purpose this time. Come early, as the crowds gather quickly, but don't be deterred if the place is already crowded -- turnover is fast and people don't linger too long. Snag a spot along the rails or at the bar, and grab yourself a glass of something sparkly and a selection of bites. Everything my traveling partner and I had was delicious (this is the only place canned mussels have done it for me), but the standout was the salmon thing. Salmon, greek yogurt, balsamic, honey on crisp toast...it's the delicious perfection you never knew you were seeking. This is the kind of place that teaches you what a real pleasure food can be, at its simplest, which is a theme in Barcelona, you'll discover.",
