    "I will remember this meal for years! Watching the chefs work was like watching an episode of Top Chef Masters, and everything I saw come out of the kitchen was a masterpiece. I enjoyed the ham croquettes, cured beef with manchego, artichoke crisps, and espuma de catalan. I'd order it all again and again. Que delicioso!",
