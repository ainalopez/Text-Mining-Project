    "A great find near my Airbnb and right around the corner from La Sagrada Familia I came here around 1030pm (average eating time for most Barcelonians) - the place was still full with locals and tourists alikeOrdered el caldo del pescado (fish soup), tortilla and cava. The food came warm and quickly. Service was great. There was free wifi. Definitely recommend for anyone in the area.",
