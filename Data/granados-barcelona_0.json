    "If you want great tapas, I highly recommend this place. \u00a0We had two gin fizzes each, along with a delicious selection of cheese and ham. \u00a0The crunchy shrimp tempura and great cheese with honey fondu really hit the spot!The waitress saw us outside looking at the menu and said the tapas were great. She said let her know if we needed anything after she sat us. The staff was at our beckon call the whole time. The ambiance was perfect for a night of drinks, small bites & great conversation. Everyone has to check this place out!",
