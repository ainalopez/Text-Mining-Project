    "I'm not a vegan and only went here bc I'm looking to unlock the Carrot Top badge (haha Martin) plus I had an hour to blow before Vaso de Oro opened and I could get my sirloin and peppers. \u00a0I have no idea what goes into making a chocolate donut vegan, but must admit it was pretty good. \u00a0Three stars bc the service was slow and there were way too many annoying vegans there taking 10min to order a vegan tea.",
