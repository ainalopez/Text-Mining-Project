    "The thing that made santutxo such an enjoyable experience was the service. The server was very helpful in translating what he could into English. The owner came out multiple times to talk to us, and tell us a bit about the food. 3 courses and a drink for 9 euro is a great deal. If you are going for just the food itself it is not the one of the best meals I've had, but the experience made it worth it.",
