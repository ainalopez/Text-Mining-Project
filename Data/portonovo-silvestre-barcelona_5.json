    "We couldn't find the restaurant recommended by our hotel, so we selected Portonovo Silvestre on the basis of the atmosphere. We chose to eat outside, which was noisy with the traffic, but we got to watch all the comings and goings. The waiters were both gruff and good-humored. I ordered Gazpacho, which was the traditional one of Southern Spain, thick and \"creamy\" rather than the bright red chunky version we usually see in the US. We also ordered Patatas Bravas, which were quite spicy and 2 plates of Jamon Iberico (one would have been enough). They also brought the ubiquitous Tomato Bread. All our items had a rustic or country feel. Not sophisticated, just solid honest food.",
