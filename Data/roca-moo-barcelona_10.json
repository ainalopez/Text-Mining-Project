    "Moo was my first experience in the world of molecular gastronomy as well. I really enjoyed it. The flavors and texture were really unique. It also probably helped that I have geeked out on every episode of Top Chef ever. My mom and I both had the Season Tasting Menu and my dad had the gourmet. I tried a taste of the Golden Egg from the Gourmet menu, which tasted a little like super savory Chex mix. The foie \u00a0gras and vanilla oil in the caramelized \"apple\" was very unique. The chicken canneloni was probably my favorite. The codfish and the pig were both really good as well. And the dessert had a violet gelee in it, which I am a sucker for. This was a very amazing experience. However, it's only getting 4 stars because some of the textures threw me off a little bit. Definitely a fun place to hit up though.",
