    "Best restaurant in BCN! Seriously neither my dad or I are vegan/vegetarian and we have been to Teresa Carles 2 (Teresa Carles & Flax and Kale) restaurants 3 times in the past 2 days! Fresh, tasty, amazingly prepared. It doesn't matter what you order- it's ALL good. We enjoyed the Mezza Platter, \"Meat\"balls, Meille Feuille Eggplant, Amazon Acai Bowl, Cubanito Smoothie, Samon w/Quinoa, Avocado + Eggplant ravioli, Scandal Scramble eggs...I would order all of them again. The juices are also fantastic. Green Slim Down, Green Goddess, Cocoa Masala yum yum and yum! If you are in Barcelona: GO HERE",
