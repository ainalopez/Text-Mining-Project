    "Not a happy dinner. \u00a0This time around since May '14 the food was not bad but the service wasn't good. Usually I go to this place leaving in high spirits because Papa (waiter) is amazing and attentive but leaving this time around service was poor and food was not as good, and obviously Papa was not there. \u00a0Female waitress was not interested in us and the male waiter, possibly manager was also the same. The avocado hummus was nice but small portion. Dinner not very warm: \u00a0we ordered (5ppl), tuna, monkfish, steak, and the risotto (the best) but still not worth returning for the service.Papa, makes this place with his service! Hope you return and if so I will visit you, only \u00a0for drinks!",
