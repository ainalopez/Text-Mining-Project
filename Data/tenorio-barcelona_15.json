    "Swift service, but beware you'll be waiting for food for ages, then some stuff gets added to your bill without you knowing it, and on top of it you get hairs in the food. No apologies or offer to substitute or make another one - just took the plate away. On top of it, a shot of Spanish brandy ran 18 euro, and everywhere else in this town it's more like 3. By and large, this is a real tourist trap and nothing short of a classic rip off. If you have to dine in the area, go across the street or even to Plaza Catalunya - the service may not be as swift, but you get better food that is also cheaper.",
