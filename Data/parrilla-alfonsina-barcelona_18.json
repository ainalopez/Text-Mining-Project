    "We went to Barcelona, and ended up at an Argentinian restaurant! :) And boy, are we glad we did. It was our favorite meal during our trip. The entire experience was fantastic. The owner was a lovely woman who came over to chat with us as best she could in English, and recommended their prix fix option of a variety of different steaks, with a side of potatoes and a bottle of wine. Before I even get to the meal, can I take a moment to savor the bread!? She told us it would be good, but wow, was it tasty. Straight out of the oven, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and served with chimichurri sauce that I would have chugged if I could. Anyway, the meat didn't take very long at all, and we had a perfectly prepared platter of medium rare filet, strip, sirloin, and ribeye. It was an overwhelming amount of meat, but we were up for the challenge! All of it was cooked to perfection, we took to soaking the potatoes in the juices. After dinner we had an alfajor cookie and tiramisu, both very good. The restaurant was getting really busy, so the owner asked us if we could move to a smaller table to accommodate waiting guests. We gladly obliged, and in return got a free pitcher of sangria! And naturally, that meant ordering another dessert. So we tried the crepes. It was the right decision. :) Cannot recommend this restaurant enough!",
