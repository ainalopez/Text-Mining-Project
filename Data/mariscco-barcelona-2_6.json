    "My husband and I ran into a random student at the airport who wouldn't stop talking to us and he ended up recommending this restaurant. \u00a0Luckily it was very close to our hotel and in fact we ate here twice. \u00a0 It was hard for us to figure out when they opened since we arrived in Barcelona on a Sunday and everything was closed.When you first walk in, you see all the fresh seafood on the counter and you can pick what you want and they'll weigh it. \u00a0Depending on how you want it cooked, they'll give you recommendations on what to order. \u00a0 On our first visit, we ordered some large prawns for our paella, a recommendation from the workers and some oysters.After waiting for just a little while, the paella came out - an ENORMOUS portion for just two people. \u00a0We stuffed ourselves silly with the paella and the prawns were excellent. \u00a0 Oysters were also very fresh but nothing special.On our next visit, we actually ate lunch prior to coming here, but knew we wanted more before heading back to the states. \u00a0We ordered the calamari from the counter and had them grill it for us in oil and garlic. \u00a0Once again, it was very fresh and delicious. \u00a0I think we ordered oysters again too. \u00a0If I were hungrier, I would've gotten the paella again but this was just enough to fill us up for our second lunch. \u00a0I would definitely return multiple times the next time I am in Barcelona!",
