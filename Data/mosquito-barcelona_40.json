    "Mosquito is fabulous. \u00a0My second night in town I came here with my \"host parents\" so they could show me one of their favorite neighborhood spots. \u00a0As they are Catalan as far back as their families go and have lived quite hip lives here in Barcelona for the past decade or so their recommendations have been killer, and this is no exception. \u00a0We got to Mosquito at about 11:30pm and the place was packed and there were about ten people waiting outside, so we grabbed a drink down the street to wait it out a bit. \u00a0Upon returning at 1am it was still busy but we were able to grab a table near the bar. \u00a0We ordered various dumplings, which are certainly the center of attention here, but we also got several other dishes including some ramen, a plate of mushrooms and other veggies which were all delicious. \u00a0We ordered some hot dishes and some cold, and the mix of flavors, spices, temperatures and textures was sublime. \u00a0The people were mostly locals, the food was delicious. the lights dim and the music was great (think The National).",
