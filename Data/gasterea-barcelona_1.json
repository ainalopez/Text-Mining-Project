    "Our first tapas experience went well! We didn't see the arroz con pulpo stew on the menu until the end, when we were full. Too bad! Instead, we pointed and perused and ended up with:- Black sausage with red peppers and quail egg- Shrimp/artichoke/sesame sauce- Catalan sausage- Chorizo- Goat cheese with candied figs- Vinegared anchovies with olive tapenade - Steak with chimichurri (the bartender was offering this around, and I thought it was a gift, but it was not. Lesson learned)- Cod salad - Some kind of Scandinavian brand of awesome tonic waterThe standouts to me were the cod (a chunky, red peppery spread of it), the black sausage (unapologetically bloody and who can argue with a quail egg?), and the shrimp, because it was supposed to be Asian style but tasted like tahini, in a good way.My mom liked the other sausages, but I thought they were too salty and had a little too much of whatever spice makes something taste like a breakfast sausage from the freezer section at the grocery store. I loved the no-pressure atmosphere here. It was equally fine with them whether you got one thing or fifty things, and you could take as much time as you needed. I guess that's commentary on tapas culture in general.",
