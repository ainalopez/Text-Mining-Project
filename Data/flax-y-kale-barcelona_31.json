    "Incredible ambiance.The architecture and the decor makes this place a must go for Barcelona.Big open spaces. Glass walls and modern looks meet rustic and organic.They have restored beautiful details of the original Building which adds a unique charm and charisma.The food is also good and a good choice of you care about quality and healthy.I especially liked the salmon sashimi over a crunchy toast. The carrot cake was excellent too.The cold pressed juices are also very good!Highly recommended!",
