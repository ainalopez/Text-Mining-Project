    "The wait was ridiculous - almost 2 hours. But between my cousin's friends and us, we tag teamed it so one person didn't have to stand for so long. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! That 2 hour wait was nothing after I tried everything they had to offer here. It is a locals' spot (hence the constant crowd), so I am very lucky to have family out there that takes me to these places. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have found it as a lone tourist. Since I didn't recognize any of the tapas, I let everyone else order. The only thing I recognized were the patatas bravas, and even those were different than the ones I'm used to. I finally even tried those tiny crispy fish. I always get grossed out when my dad eats them, but I think all the sangria I had made me a little more adventurous and I ended up loving them! What a treat it was to try this place. All the tapas were delicious and the service was quick. Quite the Catalonian experience! I wish we had a place like this nearby!",
