    "Nice little display of seafood on ice on the ground floor, with a bit of modern flair.Descending to the seating area in the basement shows more stone and brick, but still an extremely modern feel. Service was good-- a tad short of excellent.Grilled eggplant and anchovy was okay (a bit of a ripoff), mussels were a bit overwhelmed by the tomato (still quite good), and unfortunately I am not a fan of paella so someone else will have to pass judgement-- however within my limitations, I found the noodle paella excellent and the regular seafood paella to be almost as good. Mussels and crawfish on beautiful display in the latter.Heck they even fabricated a to-go container for us for the last bit of regular paella to take back and eat later!",
