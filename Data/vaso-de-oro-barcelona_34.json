    "I was really disappointed after trying this place out. \u00a0Based on the reviews I was really pumped about this place. \u00a0Even after walking in and having a seat, I even felt better thinking that this was a good find. \u00a0However, to be honest, this was my least favorite dining experience while in Barcelona.We had the croquettes, bravas, smoked salmon, fois gras, and the Granjero sandwich. \u00a0Croquettes were okay.. nothing stood out, but nothing is ever really wrong with deep fried meat. \u00a0The Bravas weren't seasoned but instead had a mayo-like and spicy sauce smothered on top- the sauce made the dish. \u00a0The smoked salmon was good quality but again, nothing special, just doused in some olive oil and salk/pepper. \u00a0The fois gras was probably the best thing here, with a nice touch of sauteed onions. \u00a0And the sandwich- well forget about it! I had high hopes for this, as it was ham, lettuce, mayo, and an egg grilled on some buttery bread. \u00a0But it was like eating mush.. no flavor at all! And you would think with ham, it would at least taste like salt.. but no, not in this case... Overall, bland tapas that didn't stand out. \u00a0The shocker was the fact that for all this, plus 3 cokes, the bill came out to 44\u20ac. \u00a0Do yourself a favor, and find a less expensive place that will have better flavor than this place",
