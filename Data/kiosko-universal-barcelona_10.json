    "Now, why can't seafood taste like this all the time? Two trips to Kiosko Universal have my mom and I hooked on stir fried mushrooms and scallops so fresh you could still smell the sea on them. Is this heaven? We also loved the raiser clams because they were sweet but also salty, and very tender. Two seafood lovers are full, but will have memories of this \u00a0very bustling place.",
