    "This 12 course meal with wine pairing was one of the most memorable meals I have ever had in my life. The portions were generous and the tastes were unique and remarkable. It was also very affordable, more so than most tasting menus in Barcelona about $100 per person with wine pairing. Stop looking and just check this place out!!",
