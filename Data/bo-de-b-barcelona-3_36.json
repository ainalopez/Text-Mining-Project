    "Expect a line for some good sandwiches (bocadillos) which are recognized by many as the best in Barcelona.Very simple, but very good. \u00a0Hearty and well seasoned chunks of grilled chicken cooked to order, fresh vegetables, and dressed with a couple of sauces in a baguette. \u00a0It can get pretty messy with ingredients falling out everywhere when you eat it, but it really just shows how they aren't trying to skimp you on the fillings by just selling you a piece of bread.",
