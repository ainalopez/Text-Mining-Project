    "A friend recommended this place to me for being a notorious student spot with the best sandwiches in Barcelona! The line was long, a clear indicator that it was something worth waiting for! Upon entering the little shop, it was clear why. Meats, sauces, and veggies were lined up waiting to be chosen for large loaves of breads as according to the customers tastes. I ordered a chicken sandwich with ALL the sauces, and almost all the veggies (not big on cabbage!). Everything was incredibly fresh and the chicken was very flavorful.The sauces were spicy and strong, in a way that perfectly complemented the sandwich. All that for 5 euros! Will definitely recommend to any Barcelona foodies!",
