    "Great hidden gem. Great interior, nicely airconditioned with clean bathrooms in the midst of all the chaos in Barca. However. I would say that the noodles of the ramen is a little disappointing. Perhaps \"Ramen YaHiro\" is the place for a true experience, but that place is not airconditioned or has a staff that speaks fluent English. The staff here are the ones who can communicate very well. But the soup is very good and they kindly substituted the kimchi for another spice to make it spicy/picante for me, since I don't eat kimchi. I enjoyed my food and time here. The Gyoza though, could have been cooked a bit more... I would really give it a 3.5 or something, but the staff and the clean restaurant makes me give it a 4 as a roundup.",
