    "Our Airbnb hostess recommended this place to find authentic tapas at a reasonable price. When we arrived, there were two other American girls also going in who had been told to go there as well. I guess locals like it!The waiter was very friendly and spoke Spanish, Catalan, and English. We had the croquetas de jam\u00f3n (6), tigres, which are spicy baked breaded mussels (6) and a half of the meat plate, which had a generous selection of cured meats and sausages. They were all yummy. We also got the traditional toasted bread with tomato sauce. This was too much food for the two of us, so we'll have leftovers for lunch. Overall the food was good, prices reasonable and the atmosphere was nice. Since it was our first night out in Barcelona, I don't have much to compare it to, but it was a satisfying dining experience. The other items on the menu included cow, sheep and goat milk cheeses and some dried fish.",
