    "This is the real deal, a true cerveseria with simple and tasty tapas. Don't even try speaking English however, point and be friendly as necessary. Good local beer, I'm not even sure but I think it's made on the premises (the dark is really nice). Food , simple but perfect with beer really (lots of choices you really can't go wrong). Considering the price (this is not a \"high brow\" place) highly recommended.",
