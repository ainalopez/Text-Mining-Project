    "My favorite restaurant for dal in Barcelona! \u00a0Found it while wandering around Gracia. \u00a0Unlike many restaurants that bland down their dishes to the Spanish palate, Himali stays true. \u00a0Additionally, they have flavorful condiments to enhance/complement their dishes. \u00a0I've also had their saag. \u00a0It's pureed so it's a different texture than I'm used to, but the flavor is nice.Recommended.",
