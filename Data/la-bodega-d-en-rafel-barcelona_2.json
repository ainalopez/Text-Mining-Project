    "When I first walked into this place, I thought that it was dingy and was ready to leave for another tapas place after one drink. There were only two tables of customers, one large table and one small table. A few minutes in however, I started to change my mind. We ordered a few tapas which looked extremely ordinary and sat down at a table. The other larger table (apparently a table of Australians) just left, and the owner came to chat with his limited English. He was extremely friendly and I think he was particularly pleased with the fact that there were international visitors at his restaurant. Our waiter, a very pleasant white-haired old man who also didn't speak any English, gestured numerous wine and tapa recommendations to us. He was the sweetest old man and constantly came back to make sure we were taken care of. Although the fork and knife that we were given were slightly stained, we enjoyed the food and the overall experience. They didn't have a menu and served some dishes of the day, including saut\u00e9ed snails, olives and sardines, roasted partridge, and tomato paste bread. The whole restaurant/bar was eventually full of locals who just seemed to enjoy their time with a coffee and/or wine. Another old customer behind us deliberately came over to show us how to eat the snails properly, and made recommendations on a mint-liquor expresso at the end of the meal. The visit made us feel the warmth of Barcelona locals and truly experience what it means to live as a Catalonian. Wonderful!",
