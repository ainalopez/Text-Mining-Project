    "Ok, ok, ok I am a guy who lets the first impression to be too important. That what happened to me with La Monroe. I came here a couple of times last summer and I decided that there were other bars that were more interesting to me. And that was the last time I sat in their terrace. Until yesterday. I was with a bunch of friends celebrating a b-day and someone said that food was good. After only making a couple of jokes about the staff's outfits I decided to let it go and I joined the party. We order a couple of tapas and a couple of dishes. I have to say that they were pretty good. After we had a couple of their homemade desserts that were quite good. Definitively not a bad place to go before or after a movie in the filmoteca. And the bill was also quite good",
