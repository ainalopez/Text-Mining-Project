    "After my poor experience next door at MariscCo, I decided to violate my New Yorker rules and wait in the huge line at Les Quinze Nits. Most of the waiting had to do with outside seating in the plaza - there was no wait at all to sit inside.The appeal here seems to be solid, non-touristy food at reasonable prices. You often get charged for water in Europe since they bring you a half-liter glass bottle. Here, they also charged 1 euro for not much bread, which was mildly annoying.I ended up ordering the paella I was searching for. Like at MriscCo, it was also only available for two, but I convinced them to serve it to me for slightly more money.It was good, but not amazing. The shrimp, rice and tomatoes were excellent. The beef was a little tough. The experience was great - friendly waitress, lots of street performers and great weather for eating outside. Definitely worth the wait for the price.",
