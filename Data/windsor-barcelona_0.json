    "The food was first rate. For appetizers, we had some very tasty cannelloni (a yelper posted a pic) and a raw/marinated tuna & foie gras dish...an unusual combination that was quite enjoyable.For our mains, we had sous vide lamb, Very tasty and pleasant, it was an unusual delivery of lamb...we were even shaking our heads that it was lamb. We also had turbo with fava...simple but well executed.We shared a dessert, their bread with chocolate and olive oil. We understand this to be a common type of dessert grandma would give the kids. This version had both a great texture and flavor. We weren't sold on the olive oil, but were glad we tried it.Service was top notch as well. All the staff were polished, spoke English very well (while not essential, it certainly helps) and friendly.Was it expensive? While not cheap, I believe it was less expensive than if it were located in any other major city. We felt it was reasonably priced and worth the money charged. I'm not certain what to make of the fact that all of the tables of diners who were there when we entered were still there when we left, hours after entering.If you were only going to go to one restaurant in Barcelona, I don't think I would steer you here. But, if like us, you've already had loaves of pan con tomate, legs worth of jamon Iberico, a bathtub of razor clams, a wheel of manchego...and are looking for a bit more sophisticated dining experience, we would wholeheartedly recommend Windsor.It was a wonderful place to spend our last night in Barna!",
