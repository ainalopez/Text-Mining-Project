    "I Went there with a friend for menu del d\u00eda, \u00a0first it was really expensive 15\u20ac for what they offer with small portions as my friend took menu del d\u00eda , I decided to choose something a la carte, \u00a0tuna burger 12\u20ac and it was a tiny portion that it is not enough for a kid, I ended up paying like 40\u20ac and we left the restaurant hungry I think the place is nice but the prices are too high",
