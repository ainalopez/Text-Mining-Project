    "Granted, the views from atop Tibidabo are splendid - but here you can sit on a shady veranda and literally hang over the city with a beer. Sorta hard to top.They feature live jazz in the evening. On a hot summer night in BCN, this is where to \u00a0be.We enjoyed cheese and olives and sucked back a cool beer on a clear afternoon. Wow. Mellow hardly describes it. After the tram ride down, and before crossing the street to enjoy a meal at La Venta - this is the place.Highly recommended.",
