    "What's not to like? \u00a0Simple menu that has essentially three things: falafel in a pita with hummus and salad; falafel on a salad; and French fries. \u00a0You add other stuff from the small toppings bar. \u00a0You also get to squirt on your own sauces. \u00a0Simple, wholesome, well executed.",
