    "Buffalo mozz, tomatoes, and rocket salad. Fo-get-about-it. A little skeptical at first bc of a couple poor reviews, but after one bite I was totally convinced this place is the truth. My lady had the goat cheese salad which I tried and it was great. All ingredients are top quality. Bolognese may be the best Ive had. Great ratio of meat to tomato and it does not overpower the taste of the perfectly cooked penne. Overall this is the best place I have been to in Europe.",
