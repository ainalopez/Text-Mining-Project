    "My favourite tapas bar in Barcelona by a mile. It may not look anything special from the outside but the range of top value tapas is absolutely superb. You enter the place and sit around a large U shaped bar with all the food layed out and protected by glass (imagine being in a butchers shop). You then simply keep on ordering and ordering from the chap behind the bar until you're full and wash the whole lot down with a ca\u00f1a. This tapas bar always has a large number of locals using it rather than posher looking places in the tourist traps. They do so for a good reason.",
