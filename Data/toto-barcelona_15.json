    "Horrible service, although good food, no management or supervision of the lazy staff - bartender and waiter should join the ranks of the unemployed -- I spoke with the manager, who apologized and basically said it's hard to find good waiters in Barcelona, which seems ridiculous given the unemployment rate in Spain. Don't waste your time here when there are far better restaurants in this lovely city !",
