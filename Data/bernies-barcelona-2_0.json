    "It's my parents first time or of the US and we ended up at this little place. They got in wire late from their flight and just a little bit of home is exactly what they needed.It is right by the hotel we're staying at, so that made it super convenient. For 4 of us to eat, it was less than \u20ac40. The good was pretty good, just simple burgers and chicken sandwiches is all we had.The staff was super nice and welcoming. I'd go here again if there weren't do many other places to experience around here.",
