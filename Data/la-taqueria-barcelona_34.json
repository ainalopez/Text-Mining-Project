    "Cute little authentic feeling restaurant very close to La Sagrada Familia. Tacos were delicious- the arrachera was very tender and deliciously seasoned. They had a mix of traditional beers and food and also served micheladas. We highly recommend this place for anyone craving some Mexican food in Barcelona!",
