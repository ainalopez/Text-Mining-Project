    "This is the best Mexican restaurant I've eaten at in Barcelona. It's location is close to la sagrada familia but the great thing is that you won't find many tourists there. I went with some friends for lunch and was surprised at how good and authentic the food was. The interior was nicely decorated and the service was good. Their specialty is their tacos and they exceeded my expectations. The tacos al pastor my friend ordered looked delicious. The chips were very good and tasted homemade. The Mexican horchata I ordered was better than the Mexican horchata I've had in Colorado. This place will satisfy your craving for authentic Mexican food in Barcelona.",
