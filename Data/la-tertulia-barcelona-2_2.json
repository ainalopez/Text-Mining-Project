    "Fantastic food, atmosphere, and staff. A can't beat kind of place - one which is also a hidden gem in an area of the city that really lacks restaurants that feel trendy yet cozy. We were in the Le Corts area of the city for one night, and after strolling the streets during the day hoping to spot somewhere cute for dinner, we didn't. We turned to our trusty yelp for inspiration. There weren't many reviews, but they were dead on. At first we thought we were following a dead end on the map, as this restaurant is located down a quiet street on an unexpected corner. We even thought it was closed at first; we were forgetting that many Spaniards don't go for dinner til 10pm. It was 9:45 when we got there. It was full by 10. Our waiter Sayed was a true delight. We conversed in a mixture of Spanish and English, and were persuaded to try the Darada fish 'con sal' (with salt). He took the time to bring out the fish to show us how it was being preparing (whole, covered in a mound of salt). When it arrived on our plates, it was deboned and beheaded, and looked just like a piece of fish, but we knew it was prepared and served with so much love. Sayed also prepared the crepes we ordered for dessert the side of our table. Can't beat the bit of entertainment. Oh, and get the mussels to start! And the rioja.",
