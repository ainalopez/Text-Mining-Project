    "Gotta say, I don't understand the appeal. I like the feel of the place, the casual feel and the local feel of a family run business. And the service and clientale definitely felt like authentic Barcelona, without any pretense that you would expect from some of the more tourist driven establishments. However when it comes to their products, I wasn't impressed at all.They only serve 4 tapas, and I ordered 3 of them. My impressions:Fried Anchovies: It basically is what it is, and not particularly flavorful on any stretch. Nice little snack, but something that I can(and have) replicated at home without too much trouble.Sausage on toast: Self-explanatory. The sausage is alright, but i mean how complicated could this dish be?Anchovy on toast: You get one little piece of anchovy on the same toast as the sausage, with what appears to be some sort of spread that doesn't add all too much flavor. For what it's worth, I expected the fish to bread ratio to be a little more substantial.Of these tapas, the only thing that might be worth it is the fried anchovies. With the other two, they were unremarkable, and while people may say that they're cheap, you can get cheaper tapas for the 2.5 euro. Especially because for the two toast tapas, you're mainly just getting bread.",
