    "The food here is amazing! I am a breakfast connoisseur, so I feel comfortable with my judgment of this place. It's a little tightly packed but adorable, nonetheless. The service is super quick but based on the brunch, I'm sad I didn't get to try any of the cakes (I'm just assuming they carry them).",
