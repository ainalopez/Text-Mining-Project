    "Thanks to Yelp, we had a great dinner at Alfonso's. The food is great and the folks are generally nice. One server even gave us one more chocolate croquette (this is one heavenly fried ball of chocolate, I must say) cos these 2 Asian girls' limited appetite could only allow us to order one to share. That was actually our last night in Barcelona before we fly home and that little gesture was a sweetener to the end of our wonderful trip in Spain. Do note that the sangria here comes in small jug and costs about \u20ac10. Having been to so many bars that just serves up a glass at \u20ac3-4 when ordered for 1 pax, we got a little shocked when we fit the bill but it was a mini jug, so the price was right, just we didn't expect that to cost that much and it wasn't listed on the menu.Other than that, it was a decent dinner with hearty food and served with a warm heart. Loved it.",
