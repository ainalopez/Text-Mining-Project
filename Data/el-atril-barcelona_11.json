    "We floated into this place on a high of dance-step-following an amazing drum line from a nearby square. We were in a very positively charged happy place, and this place did NOT harsh our buzz. On the contrary: \u00a0the excellent atmosphere, delicious cold beer, warm service, and sublime tapas made us think it's a whole wonderful world. We were a hungry four, so we shared:guacamole (fresh delicious!)ceviche (same!)kangaroo....? (yep! a.....different....flavor, but glad we put it in our mouths!)foie gras (not kidding! on toast, with a dab of sweetness? perfecto!)patatas bravas (perfect patatas & THE BEST bravas sauce i've ever put in my mouth!)I'm absolutely a fan and only wish I were able to pop in any ol time I fancied.",
