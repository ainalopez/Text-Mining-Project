    "Swagatam is located alongside Passeig De Gracia on Carrer Sant Augustin. It's a small restaurant with approximately a dozen tables and a full bar. Service was great however the authenticity of the food was about average. We had the Mutton Seekh Kebabs and Chicken Tikka Masala. The Chicken Tikka Masala was more on the sweet side than on the tandoor side. Perhaps it was prepared to suit the tastes of Barcelona rather than authentic Indian Tandoor. The cost of the dishes was acceptable. This place is not a formal place however does the job if one is hungry and craving for the Indian cuisine.",
