    "Rounding a downtown street corner near Passeig de Gracia on Saturday, a menu caught my attention. Gastronomic was the key word. Fresh take on Spanish tapas it was delivering. The meal was fantastic, amazing food porn picture worthy, and quite affordable. This was the Ohla Hotel's Gastronomic Restaurant and Bar.The meal started with a meat cannelloni featuring whipped truffle butter along with a croquette. This was followed by a selection from their menu's egg portion. Simply beautiful, there were two eggs, asparagus, fine bellota ham and light black pepper. Eat slowly, cherish the flavors.I'd like to point out one very notable aspect, their open kitchen. They have ample bar seating so you can watch the chefs work. Naturally, when the one waiter mentions an a la carte pork shoulder that isn't on their menu, you say yes. I waited approximately 15 minutes, but they kept me sated with house roasted almonds (paprika and two other spices). The pork fell off the bone nicely, the sauce was savory, and the portion amazing. Knowing the quality of Spanish pork, eyeing the portion size, I was a bit monetarily concerned. 8 Euro. Fears alleviated, Ohla's praises sung again.",
