    "After hours of no sleep (30 hours) and a plane ride we were exhausted and hungry. We stepped out of our rental to walk about and being spoiled from Miami having a \"mixologist\" on every corner I was stoked to see the word Mixologist and cocktails! We walked in to a super sweet staff got a few tapas. Ceviche and cucumber salad were on point! Their iced coffee hit the spot, and the drinks. The drinks were delicious. I'm a fan of basil so naturally the basil smash and elephant swizz couldnt have been better. Will be here for breakfast for the rest of our stay.",
