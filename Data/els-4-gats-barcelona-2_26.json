    "My mom & I had lunch here yesterday around 2 pm. We had the special menu for 15 euro each, a bottle of wine & a bottle of water. We thought we ordered only 2 glasses of wine but accepted the bottle. When we arrived there were a lot of tourists (so are we) but the place came highly recommended from a local who now lives in NYC. I'm surprised that previous reviews are poor! By the time we left this adorable restaurant (which is off the beaten path), locals were coming in for their breaks so I'd say there was a mix of clientele. Our food was very good. I don't remember the proper names from the menu so I'll simplify: first course: mushroom soup (mushroom creme with toasts?) & vegetable risotto. These were presented to us so sweetly. Second course: mom had confit of cod and I had a burger (I know, I know, but let me assure you it was yum). Third course: chocolate & peanut gelato and Sacher torte. The service was spectacular. A little slow at first, but they were packed when we first arrived so that totally gets a pass. Besides, this is not (thankfully) NY. They gave us the bottles of water & wine on the house. Not a mistake, as we pointed out the omission on the check and it was waved away. 10 % had already been added and so we gave about 5 euro more (round it up!).",
