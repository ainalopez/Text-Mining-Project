    "We had a group of 7 and only had to wait 20 minutes for a table at noon on a Saturday. Definitely an all-time favorite brunch according to every member of our group! Chicken Korma, eggs benedict, chocolate & banana pancakes, huevos rancheros, and scrambled eggs- all delicious! And if you're questioning whether or not to get a mimosa or beer, go for it! The orange juice was freshly squeezed, and the beer on tap was great. Service was friendly. Menus were available in Catalan and English. They only allow 1 bill per table.",
