    "My guide to surviving Spain should start with \"don't show up on time\". In fact, if you're going to a restaurant, show up at least 30 minutes late.I was excited to try Domino Bar after the reviews I read on Travel Advisor. I read about the great pizzas and cocktails, so I thought I'd get there early and beat potential crowds, giving myself time for my later evening plans.Their website states they open at 6pm and I arrived around 6:20. The door was halfway open and I peaked inside. I asked if they were open and the guy said they open at 6pm, looked at his watch, and said to give him 5-15 minutes. Okay? Well, he opened up the door and let me come inside. The bartender arrived shortly and I asked for a Tapinha na Bunda. It was a good cocktail - some citrus notes and bloody strong. I nursed my drink and took my observations. They looked nowhere close to serving food. The one guy was preparing zucchini and another large green vegetables. The bartender was also doing a little setup. I thought about asking for food, but then the food guy went outside to smoke. I'm not sure if he washed his hands when he returned and just thought lingering thought turned me off the food.Maybe I'll give them a second chance. Maybe it will be a tale of two restaurants. We'll see.",
