    "Do not miss this tiny tapas bar! \u00a0Four dishes, all amazing and the best my family tried our entire visit in Spain. \u00a0We were a little bit limited, as my 92 year old grandma needed to sit during meals, so we could not go to some tapas bars that I read were excellent. \u00a0We were staying in a beautiful apartment just half a block away on the same street. \u00a0Every night we walked by La Plata and I thought, wouldn't it be funny if this place was amazing and we never stopped by, even though it was so close! \u00a0So, after looking it up online, I found that lot's of people love this place and convinced my family to try it. \u00a0Even though they don't like sardines; one of their four dishes. \u00a0I convinced them that we could try their tapas and then go somewhere else for more food. \u00a0We went super early, between 7 and 8, and they were full, so waited about 10 or so minutes for a tiny table. \u00a0We ordered one of everything. \u00a0They have 1. Fried Sardines 2. Tomato Salad, with onions and olives 3.Tomato Bread and 4.Sausage on Bread, which were all so delicious! \u00a0Even my mom and grandma, who don't like sardines ate the fish. \u00a0They all were so glad we went, saying their tapas were the best we had had; so true. \u00a0The young waiter was so sweet and helpful. \u00a0After we quickly devoured all the tapas, he gave us a plate of sweet bread, which was also delicious. \u00a0Thank you for delicious food!!!*They are closed Sundays, like most stores and other small restaurants/tapas bars.",
