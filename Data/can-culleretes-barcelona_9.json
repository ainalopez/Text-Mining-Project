    "ok so we get to Can Cullerestes before 9pm and the door is locked! You enter thru a narrow alley and the wait is worth it.Great sausage and beans. Get the liter of house wine no label no fancy talk , just red wine. Great deal! Grilled Salmon was nice and of course Paella.Wonderful experience!",
