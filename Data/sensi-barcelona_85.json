    "I'm very sorry to say that I was very disappointed. The staff works very hard and they are nice! It was my boyfriend's last night in Barcelona with me and he wanted to eat \"Suckling pig\". I got on Yelp to help me find a good place and Sensi seemed to be the best option. Four stars and a half!!!! Wow! We get there and the place is full, meanwhile other restaurants around it are empty. We think, \"Well, it must be good, let's wait for seats at the bar since we don't have a reservation.\" We had a drink at a bar next door and then went back. We sat at the bar on this tiny stools that I had to turn sideways in order to fit 3/4 of my butt (I'm a size 6) on it. It was uncomfortable. The menu sounds great, everyone seems to enjoy being there so I tried to relax and enjoy as well. My boyfriend is super excited about the tapas we ordered and they were quick to bring the first tapas (3 medium size grilled shrimps with Asian noodles) and our bottle of wine. Cups were clean, dishes were semi clean. The taste was OK, normal. Oh, well, let's see about the rest: Deboned suckling pig, risotto foie gras, Catalan mushroom soup, duck casserole. Everything was OK, just OK. Portions were smaller than regular tapas already are. I had more wine than I had food. When the bill came, there was a charge for utensils and bread for less than \u20ac3. I see this as very petty. The bill was a total of \u20ac70.",
