    "After having a very pleasant lunch as a Welcome to BCN we came back to have a late dinner after an exhausting day of sightseeing and museum hopping. Even better experience! Highly recommended! Special place, excellent service and delicious food - what is there not to like? Say hi to Idoia - co- owner, Gerard and the very friendly staff.",
