    "Thank goodness \"Yelp\" is now available in Barcelona for without Yelp it is unlikely that we would have discovered the elegant, intimate Pitarra restaurant near the Born district. \u00a0We sensed we were in for a treat when the owner ushered us into the small (for a restaurant) very attractive dining room. \u00a0We started with a salmon/avocado salad garnished with caviar and a light citrus vinaigrette dressing (my choice) and \u00a0wild mushroom crepes (my guy's choice). Both dishes were large enough to share, were served on individual plates. Each bite was so delicious we thought we would cry--seriously! However, \u00a0 the crepes cried out for a red wine (we'd ordered a half bottle of cava to come with the main entree), and the waiter suggested the house red--very big, very smooth, and a perfect accompaniment to the creamy, mushroom and cheese filling. \u00a0Our steaming seafood paella (enough for two) was served as if on cue filled with a variety of seafood (mussels, clams, shrimp, squid)--more tears of joy. \u00a0We forced ourselves to try dessert---an orange cake and a Catalan dessert: chocolate nougat ice cream confection...weeping now, and were, alas completely overcome with joy when \"la cuenta\" (the bill) arrived at about 80 USD. \u00a0 When in Barcelona experience Pitarra--a delectable experience.",
