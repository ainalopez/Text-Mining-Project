    "GO HERE! \u00a0Anthony Bourdain would love this place. \u00a0 Maybe he's been? \u00a0 You walk in and it looks like a seafood market. \u00a0Extremely fresh fish, some still alive. \u00a0Order by the pound or tell them how many people are in your party, then seat yourself and wait for them to call your number. \u00a0Don't be intimidated when you walk in. \u00a0They'll help you. \u00a0Theyll even tell you (in English or Spanish) ehat you should order, how much you should order and how it's best prepared - red sauce, garlic butter parsley sauce, or fried. \u00a0There were 2 of us and we ordered grilled Calamari, shrimp, seared rare tuna and razor clams (the best!) all in parsley sauce. \u00a0We also had fresh oysters and crab (served cold), and we split a soup (they recommended it). \u00a0Make sure to order bread to eat with the sauce. \u00a0Our only regret was not ordering something with the red sauce. \u00a0We may have to go back.",
