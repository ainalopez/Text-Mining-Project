    "If you are hungry and in El Raval this is the place for you! Superb service, cosy atmosphere, and to top all of that we got two free glasses of cava at our arrival. The slow cooked lamb is a must if you come here. For the first time in history my partner finished before me and cleaned her plate. That is enough for me to be able to give this resturant 5 stars alone. This combined with the cosy atmosphere makes Cera 23 a great place if you want to have a good time!",
