    "On our third night in Barcelona, we couldn't help ourselves...a burger sounded so good! It almost seemed wrong that we were in Barcelona seeking out a burger-joint. We turned to Yelp to see if anyone had any strong recommendations for a good burger which is when we came across Pim Pam. It was only a 10 minute walk from our hotel, so we decided we'd try it.It's sort of hidden away in the alleys of Barcelona, as most restaurants are, so be sure you know where you're going before you leave. When we walked in at 5:00 PM, the place was empty which was great for us, as we had read about long wait times. The guy behind the counter quickly offered us an English menu, which was nice too. Talk about fresh! We watched a guy hand peel the potatoes to make the fries which is probably why they tasted so good. Everything we had was fresh and delicious. The burger was perfectly seasoned and the buns were soft and fresh. Pim Pam knows how to do burgers and fries right!",
