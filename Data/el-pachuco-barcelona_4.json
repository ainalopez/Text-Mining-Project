    "Best Mexican food I have ever eaten (and I am from Southern California and have visited Mexico more than once)! The staff are very nice and everything is made in-house. It is a TINY place which is a little sad because it's hard to fit more than 2 at a table. Drinks are delicious. Recommend the chicken nachos and the tostadas. Price is great and serving are large enough to share.",
