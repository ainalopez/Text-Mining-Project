    "My favorite lunch spot in the Barrio Gotic. Someone else described the food as the perfect combination of gourmet and home cooking and I could not agree more. You can sit on the pretty plaza or inside the cozy restaurant. The set lunch menu is even more of a bargain if you sit at the bar, where you will get a discount. Plus, at lunch, you can order a half or full order of most plates, which means you get to eat multiple delicious courses without being too full. If I worked in the area, I would eat lunch here every week very happily!",
