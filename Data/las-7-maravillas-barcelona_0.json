    "This restaurant features an eclectic mix of Spanish and Russian cuisines with French decor. The service was prompt, although we were the only ones there at the time. The house vodka is cheap but well stored and appropriately chilled to a near-gel-like consistency. The staff knew to offer olives and pickles with the vodka which was a nice touch. The food selection was limited but perfectly selected. I have yet to find serious flaws. Truthfully, this restaurant receives 4.5/5 stars. The food took too long to arrive, but my date and I were able to enjoy some russian pop music in addition to the ambiance. We will definitely come back.",
