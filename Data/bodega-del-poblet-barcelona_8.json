    "Excellent tapas! \u00a0try the mushroom croquetas, perfectly sliced manchego, jamon and marinated salmon. \u00a0They also make their own house wines and vermouth. \u00a0Laura is an excellent host and is very friendly. \u00a0She made us feel right at home. \u00a0We highly recommend. \u00a0This will be on the list for all future trips to Barcelona. \u00a0Our daughter said, \"this food makes me smile!\"",
