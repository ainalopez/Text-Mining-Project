    "This was the only nicer restaurant w/ edible food I visited \u00a0last month in BCN. Despite raving praises galore, finding good food here is tricky and rare. But this place quickly became a mainstay during my last trip to spain. concierges will point eager foodies to the area near the cathedral/gothic quarter(generally awful tapas there, save for maybe hole-in-wall pubs somewhat far away from the Ramblas or cathedral) or the port near Barcelona Beach(so-so food, but great ambience). I'll 2nd that the seafood here is amazing(in general, Barcelona's food-tapas scene is depressingly overrated, I learned), both the bar and menu selections. Try the (upscale) meatballs, octopus and huge prawns(somehow, this is the only place of many I tried during 2 wks in Barcelona that can cook shrimp!).Cal Pep is close enough to the beach bars and clubs that make Barcelona so great.. so I highly recommend dropping by Cal's then hitting the beach bars, (underground) clubs, casinos etc. Drink a few cap.'s, then splurge on a taxi, lol.",
