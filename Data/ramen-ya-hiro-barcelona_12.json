    "We attempted to eat here twice week but the line was WAY too long that we decided to bail. On the 3rd attempt, we got there at 8pm and there was already a pretty long line. Thankfully, we managed to score the last table for the first round of seating after they opened. So here's the dirt: Long wait but this place offers a pretty good bowl of ramen, but like others have said before - the noodles need a little more tweaking.Shoyu ramen: broth was good, chashu was pretty good but needed a lil' more kick on the flavor. Order extra seaweed and bamboo! If you like eggs like I do, that was done with just the right amount of yolk-ooziness perfect for a bowl of hot ramen.Gyoza: yummy!Staff was super friendly and fast!",
