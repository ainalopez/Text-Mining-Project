    "Oh you must come here for tapas as it is truly a treat! \u00a0I found it in my favorite travel book and did not realize it was a tapas place I had seen on one of my favorite travel/food shows From Spain with Love with Annie Sibonney. \u00a0I saw the guy behind the counter and recognized him from her Barcelona episode! \u00a0We sidled up to his part of the counter and salivated looking at all of the fresh seafood, cheese, meet, cured goods, mmm mmm. \u00a0We ordered a round of beers and wine and then dove in! \u00a0Salmon, pate, mussels, salted cod (bacalao), razor clams (!!! Love), chestnut, caviar, foie gras, sea urchin, swordfish, baby squid - get it all, order everything you like, try new things, love love love!!! \u00a0He was so quick at turning out the tapas (little works of art!), juggling customers, and was a whiz at quickly calculating what people ordered. \u00a0I mentioned that I saw him on TV and he lit up! \u00a0Heart! \u00a0:))))We had such a wonderful time here and will always live in my wonderful memories of Barcelona! \u00a0I cannot wait to come back and Quimet & Quimet will be my first stop when I do!!",
