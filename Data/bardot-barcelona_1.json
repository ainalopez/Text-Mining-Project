    "We were on a small tapas tour that landed us here for our final bar. They saved the best for last! Everything was fantastic! I wish I knew everything I ate from here so I can list ot out for you. I must state, we stayed at Barcelona 5 more days and each day we talked about the Tapas we ate from here. If our schedule was not already so booked, I am sure we would have went back! Indeed, if I'm fortunate enough to go back to Barcelona, we are scheduling a stop here Day 1!",
