    "Tough one to rate, because I loved its area, decor, & vibe, just that 2 out of the 4 food items were just average...but boy, was the sangria the strongest ever!!! \u00a0Definitely would come back to get hammered just for this, and dirt, dirt cheap too, considering in a trendy, historic area.The chicken skewers were ok (quite big chunks, moist) but the calamares tasty and some deep fried shrimp & its accompanying mayo dip, absolutely deleesh. \u00a0Look at these pics, who wouldn't want to order these lol.I even attached the receipt so I'll know what to order next time.Area-wise: definitely the spanish flair, a bit gothic with some new.Service, actually, could've been nicer but he was efficient haha.Trendy, clean washrooms in the back.This is a great place for a party for sure.Liked its open, long concept.I'll return.",
