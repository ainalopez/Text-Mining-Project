    "You want excellent sea food in a nice atmosphere? Come here!We shared the mixed sea food plate for starters, paella for 2 and took Crema Catalana for desert. All was very delicious! We drank the white wine of the house (1 litre for 3.75 Euro!) and were surprised how good it was (mild and fruity - but a gourmet we would suggest a bottled wine instead).All waitresses belong to that kind of all Mediterranean mamas - fantastic! You feel very welcomed. Although they don't speak English we didn't have a problem to communicate.We recommend to book a table in advance. Even 2 hours in advance paid off (on a Thu). We only waited 5 min for a table when we arrived.",
