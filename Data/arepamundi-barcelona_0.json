    "This is the first place that has compelled me to log into my yelp account and write a review. It is that good. It isn't traditional Spanish or Catalan food by any means but who cares. If you're hungry and looking for cheap, affordable food, please come here. I'm sad that I found it so close to my departure. Anyways, if you don't know what an arepa is, it is two corn-based chunky tortilla type things with deliciousness in the middle. Arepamundi has a ton of styles to choose from. The reason it's called arepamundi is because they try to emulate fillings from different countries. For example, they have a Greek one which has feta and other stuff in it. My favorite is the catalan one with a type of chorizo and goat cheese. They feature two sizes for the arepas. A small one (two of these are perfect for an average sized girl that wants to try a couple flavors). And a large one which is filling for said girl. They offer very affordable combos which can come with these AWESOME cheese sticks and yummy fresh juices. The highlight for me by far (aside from the arepas) are the sauces that you can pour over your arepas if you eat in the store. It's a small store but well worth the sauces. Salivating thinking about them now. Cannot recommend this place enough!",
