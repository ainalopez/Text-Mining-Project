    "The food here is definitely fresh and of great quality. Location is great right off La Rambla and next to the market. Seating is sparse inside but abundant outside so your typical Europa restaurant. And several of the wait staff speak excellent English.Eats:Patatas BravasMariscado para DosWould definitely be back next time Mo and me are in Barca.",
