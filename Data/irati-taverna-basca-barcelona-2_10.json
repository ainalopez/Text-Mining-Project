    "Really enjoyed this place both times I went with two friends. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could \u00a0since it seems several of the tapas are heavy on the bread and cream cheese-iness and the pricing doesn't seem to make sense in terms of items being pretty much identically priced regardless of ingredient or complexity of preparation. That being said, this is traditional tapas in that you go in and stand, they count your toothpicks (or tiny plastic spoon) and figure out your bill that way. So if you absolutely must eat sitting down and have your \"personal space\" don't eat at the tapas bar here. Along with the tapas dishes lining the bar area periodically there hot bites that come from the kitchen. If there's room in the back of the place that's where you want to be to get first dibs on them. Service is pretty good overall, especially considering how busy it is and how service in Spanish restaurants is often verrrry relaxed. Several servers do understand and speak English, which was helpful to my friends not having to rely on me to translate everything in Castilian while eating in such a busy place.It's a great place if you want a good and quick meal and are on La Rambla.",
