    "Huge thanks to my friend who recommended this place to me a while back. \u00a0And I'm so glad I thought of going here on this night. \u00a0This was a strange experience, but good nonetheless. \u00a0My friend & I were starved, and wanted something nice for his last night in Barcelona. \u00a0Though we didn't have reservations, and the place was packed, the staff made accommodations for us - we could stay from 9:30 to 10:15 because they needed that table for a reservation arriving at 10:15. We were thankful that they made room for us. \u00a0Although we didn't get to try too many things, we did get a couple of some of their best dishes, and shared a bottle of wine. \u00a0The egg carpaccio was phenomenal (I love egg... you can never go wrong by serving me egg), and a fish tempura dish - I don't remember the fish. \u00a0Both were cooked to perfection, the wine was divine... our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer, try more food, and cap it off with dessert. \u00a0I will definitely return (special occasion, of course, as it's not cheap - but also - it's not *that* expensive). \u00a0The decor was wonderful, too. \u00a0A great use of space in such a tiny location.",
