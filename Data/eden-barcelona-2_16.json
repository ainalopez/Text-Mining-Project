    "Can't say enough about this little gem. Stayed in Barcelona after a 12 night cruise for a couple of nights. The first afternoon we were tired and wanted something close to the apartment we stayed at. Found Eden on Yelp. This was amazing. Plenty of seating inside for our party of seven. Got salad, pasta, and pizza. All were excellent. The best part of the whole experience was our server, Vanessa. She was pleasant and attentive. Made us Texans feel welcome with her hospitality. Come to find out she was the owner and runs with her family! \u00a0Definitely enjoys her job. We are only here two nights but probably going to go back once more before we leave. Definitely recommend this place to all who visit Barcelona and want some Italian food.",
