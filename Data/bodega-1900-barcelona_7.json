    "Where should I start? This is a vermouth bar run by the Adri\u00e0 brothers (from El Bulli heritage) but I can promise you that you won't leave hungry after sampling some of their tapas. They were so good we actually got them to squeeze us in for another meal two days later. :)We got excellent service even though we spoke English (didn't have a problem with that anywhere in Barcelona actually).Start with their house made vermouth, the potato crisps and some molecular olives and go from there. I believe we tried most of the tapas dishes and all three Cavas. Go for the Juve y Camps Millesime, but let the bottle warm up a bit on the table, they like to serve it too cold.Everything ranges from really good to perfection (hello olives ;)) but you can skip the chilled beef carpaccio (had a, for me, weird roe flavor), the chicken and foie gras cannelloni (good but not great) and the fried squid with mayo in bread (funny hot dog style but too much mayo).I will return the next time I'm in Barcelona and also try the Adri\u00e0 brothers neighboring places Tickets or 41\u00b0 Experience which seem even better.",
