    "This place is UNREAL! We went on our last night in Barcelona and to this day, it is still one of the best places I have ever eaten at. We had the artichoke chips, the duck breast salad, the mini burgers and fried eggs. Everything was remarkable! The wine was great, the staff and chefs were incredibly kind, friendly and accommodating. It was delicious and affordable. I wish I could eat there everyday!",
