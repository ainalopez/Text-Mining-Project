    "Horrible experience courtesy of a horrible waitress. You should consider avoiding this restaurant. While walking through Santa Catarina market I saw their tapas bar And we decided to eat outside. I ordered the sardines and the shrimp which seemed nice enough. My wife ordered the asparagus which was good. When the steak entrec\u00f4te arrived \u00a0rather than marbled it was Almost all fat. Even the people at the next table saw it as uneatable. My wife called the waitress who scolded us on how the steak was perfect (far from it) and refused to offer anything else and would not remove the steak from our bill. If you come here. Eat at the bar and avoid their outdoor service. Personally I would recommend u avoid this place since there are many restaurants who appreciate your business",
