    "Loved this place. My friend and I went for 2.5 hrs for dinner. We had 4 glasses of wine, a bottle of water, and maybe 13-14 different tapas items for 23\u20ac.It was choose your own style so you just save the toothpicks and the server counts them at the end. Most items were only 1\u20ac and they had a great variety. Great service, very friendly.",
