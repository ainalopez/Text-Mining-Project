    "My favorite place to eat in Barcelona and my favorite seafood place in Europe. \u00a0Fantastic fresh seafood, great prices. \u00a0Come with a Spanish speaker - my Spanish is just ok - and even though the staff is friendly, they are definitely Spanish only - not their fault. \u00a0Come enjoy, the line is not so bad if you go early and it's well worth it. \u00a0Ignore the Yelp haters who don't travel well and complain because the food, the ambiance or the preparation is not like \"back home\" = wherever that is.",
