    "you need to come here!! 3 euro for an amazing bottle of rosado wine, 3,65 euro for a foie gras ham sandwhich: this place is amazing!! It is better to go either in the morning or afternoon as you'll be squished like a sardine if you go in the evening, or even worse, you won't get in! Love this place!!",
