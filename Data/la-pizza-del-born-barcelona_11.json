    "This place serves 20+ pizzas by the slice, empanadas and desserts. \u00a0They are cash only. \u00a0The pizzas are very tasty, and there are several vegetarian options. \u00a0You order by walking up to the pizza / empanadas case, then queueing separately for drinks. The employees understand English well but prefer Spanish. \u00a0They were very helpful and yet direct. \u00a0The prices are very reasonable, about 2 euro a slice. \u00a0 Slices are medium thick crust, so two slices was plenty of food. \u00a0Sodas and beers were also inexpensive. \u00a0The desserts looked great, but I was already full of pizza. \u00a0The pesto slice, jamon con aceitunas, and champignons all received rave reviews at our table.",
