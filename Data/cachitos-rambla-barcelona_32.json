    "I've been to Barcelona 4 times and been to Cachitos 3 times. It's a great place for a casual meal and it's typically not bursting at the seams w/ people, which makes it relatively easy to get a table. The place is really cool. Right when you walk in you see bars of fresh tapas. You can then go upward to the restaurant or downstairs into a really cool lounge area that is set up with music at night. You've also got an outdoor seating area on the boulevard out front when weather is nice. I think it would be great to have a meal here and then go down to the lounge for drinks. Very chic. The food is pretty good. It's not the best I've had, but it's better than decent. I'd recommend sticking with the small plates and the lighter fare featuring delicious items on crusty bread. Pan Tomate is always a good choice. I'd avoid the Paella.And one would be foolish to leave this place w/o trying one of their 55 sangrias with a multitude of fruit options. They've got everything you could imagine and then some. If you're walking down Rambla Catalunya and trying to figure out which of those tents isn't just another tourist trap, I'd say Cachitos is your best bet!",
