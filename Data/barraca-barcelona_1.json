    "Before my trip to Barcelona, I scoured all resources to find the best paella in the city. Barraca came up a few times as a more refined, high-end option, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it out in comparison to a homier paella we'd just had. The setting was beautiful, with an open-air upstairs seating area facing the ocean at Barceloneta Beach. The beachy vibe prompted us to order a pitcher of sangria, which was probably one of the best sangrias we had on the trip. Their menu is definitely on the more expensive side, but they have a good assortment of tapas/appetizers as well as different paellas. We started with the cod fritters, which were fried just right with a delicious seasoned breading. The cod flavor still came through, and the size of the fritter was just enough not to be too heavy. We also finally decided to give the patatas bravas a try, a dish that's on literally every menu in Barcelona. It's basically just potato wedges with aioli drizzled on top, and I found theirs not to be particularly special and a little too greasy.We chose the seafood paella upon recommendation by the waiter, and were presented with a giant pan that filled the width of the table. The seafood was all cooked perfectly, and I loved the texture of the rice. Across all the paellas I've had, this one had the best cook on the rice. It had a good chew and had soaked up a lot of the natural flavors of the seafood and its broth. I loved how the paella wasn't wet, and had the crispy rice on the bottom I look for. However, it was noticeably too salty. A touch less sodium would've made for the perfect paella. All in all, it was a great dining experience with an amazing view. It's definitely geared more towards tourists willing to spend an extra buck, but worth a try to break up the monotony of restaurants on Las Ramblas.",
