    "A #NomadCEO ReviewUpon entering, the staff are bilingual and seem to be very skilled at greeting people in their native language within a few seconds of inspection! Tabarlot has refreshingly fast wifi (30mb+) which is much harder to find in Barcelona than it should be. There are one or two power outlets, and the staff seem quite OK with you using them.With a simple and great value breakfast menu, it's extremely friendly for English travellers and a good spot to get a few hours work done with only a few euros outlay. The food portions are all quite small, but Tabarlot seems to favour higher quality ingredients while keeping their prices reasonable with smaller portions. Coffee is rich and full bodied. The most substantial food you'll find here is a hamburger or bocadilla (a sub sandwich). Overall, a great bar/coffee shop that manages to maintain a traditional and high quality Spanish menu, while providing an upmarket decor and tourist friendly service that makes you feel more than comfortable to sit and get some work done.",
