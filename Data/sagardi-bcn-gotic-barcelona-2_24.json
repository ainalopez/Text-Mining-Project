    "It was too bad that it costs more to sit outside. My dogs were tired! But I was so tired of opening my wallet every other hour so I went the cheap route. We have nothing like this in the states. I was pretty excited about the concept of this place when I read about in my pre-travel research. You grab a plate, and select your pinxtos from along the bar. I think for lunch it was 1,80 EU per pinxtos to eat inside. I have no idea what I ate because nothing is labeled. I was up for the adventure so I dug right in. Yum! All kinds of new flavors were mixing around on my tongue - I was loving it! When you're done, you hand a person behind the bar your plate. They count up the picks that are left over (each pinxtos has 1 pick) to know how much to charge you.",
