    "If your taxi driver recommends that you go to this \"authentic local\" restaurant, get out and find another taxi. \u00a0They pay taxis to take tourists here where they are very untrustworthy. \u00a0It wasn't terrible but the dishonesty left a bad taste in my mouth. \u00a0I was willing to overlook the fact that we ordered a small drink and they brought us a large one instead...no big deal and honest mistake right? Nope. \u00a0When we arrived they brought a plate of bread with tomato (pan con tomate) which we \u00a0moved to he side. \u00a0When our entree arrived the waiter came back and shifted some plates on our table and HE PLANTED A HALF EATEN PIECE OF BREAD ON THE PLATE SO HE COULD CHARGE US FOR EATING THE BREAD even though we hadn't touched it. \u00a0We saw him do that and asked him what it was and he couldn't lie his way out cuz we saw him do it. \u00a0He just grabbed the whole plate and walked away. \u00a0Then when the bill came they charged us for he bread! \u00a0Don't get me wrong, the bread wasn't expensive and we ironically planned to eat it but the fact that the waiter PLANTED A HALF EATEN PIECE that wasn't ours SO HE COULD CHARGE US FOR IT was so underhanded and a little crazy. \u00a0Also we found out the taxi driver was given a commission for taking us there. \u00a0Again not a terrible thing however we had plans to go to another restaurant which had much better reviews. \u00a0We learned our lesson, go with out gut next time and AVOID THIS PLACE. \u00a0It's a shame, they would've made more money from us if they were honest as we had planned to stay for dessert and drinks but after that we just left.",
