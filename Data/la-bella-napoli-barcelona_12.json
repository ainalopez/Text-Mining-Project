    "Excellent pizza and pasta, it lived up to my exceptations in the food area but the chairs where very hard to sit on. Kind of like they did not want you to sit there and have a meal. I have a bad hip and asked for a pillow, no they did not have one or they did not understand me... - anyway next time i will bring one.",
