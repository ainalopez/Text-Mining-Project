    "This was by far the best tapas experience we had in Barcelona. It's a cozy little place hidden in the small streets near the cathedral. They have a few tables outside, we had to sit inside, but hey no problem. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is very cosy, it feels very local and not touristic. The food was just amazing ! We had cava for \u20ac2,50 a glass, ridiculous :-) Let's say this place is a hidden secret in Barcelona, so shhhhhht...don't tell anyone ;-)",
