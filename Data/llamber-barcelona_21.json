    "Best quality/price relation ive found in Barcelona. We were a group of 8 and called for a reservation on a Wednesday to attend on a Friday, after som.e insistance we got the table, our reservation was very late at 1030 pm, the table was not ready so we waited at the bar with a couple of beers, we had high expectations of this place so we were pacient and we were not dissapointed, there are two types of plates in this place, tapas and main dishes, i recommend a selection of both and to share the plates. We started with the shrimp and sparragus fondue wich was very tasty, went on with the octopus(our favorite plate) and finished with the entrecot, for the final one best meat ive ever had in Barcelona and the fried yuca was quite interesting. To drink a tempranillo from Castilla and an Albarino, perfect!! Zip that wine gently and take your time to enjoy the high cuisine, price shoul not be an issue in this place, enjoy.",
