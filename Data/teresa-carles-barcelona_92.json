    "Amazing experience! My wife and I found this place on Yelp it was a very short walk from our hotel in Las Ramblas. We have decided that this is the best vegetarian restaurant we have ever been to! We ordered a lot of food and every single dish was so good. Even the tables around us were definitely enjoying their dishes as we discussed with them a few times. Highly recommended!!! Great atmosphere too.",
