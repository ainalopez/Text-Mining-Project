    "I love arepas, but the three my husband and I shared weren't up to par. The fillings were delicious, but the actual arepa was soggy and dripping butter. I like them with a crisp shell and was disappointed by this one. Maybe it was a fluke? The guy working the shop was super nice and the restaurant had a great vibe.",
