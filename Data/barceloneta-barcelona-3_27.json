    "After being highly recommended by both our concierge and trip advisor my wife and I were expecting quite an authentic and impressive tapas experience. Upon arriving the atmosphere looked pleasant, the menu extensive with options, and the plates in the kitchen window exciting. Though we will say the service was fast, it was impersonal at best. Of the plates we ordered (croquettes, cannelloni and steamed rock mussels) none are memorable. They all lacked flavor - bland is our kindest review. Though the dessert was the highlight, the kitchen had already set a low bar.",
