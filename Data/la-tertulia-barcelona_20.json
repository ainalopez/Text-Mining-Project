    "This was the first restaurant I visited in Spain. The prices are reasonable, the tapas were delicious, and as another reviewer noted, the locals do hang out inside. I wouldn't say it was the best food or service I have ever had, so keeping this at 4 stars, but I would definitely recommend the deep fried camembert cheese with raspberry sauce and the fried eggplant with goat cheese!",
