    "Hands down THE BEST MEAL we had in Barcelona. \u00a0This was also the best tapas meal I've ever had in my life and that is a bold statement coming from me, Mrs Piggy, who has eaten a lot in my lifetime ;).Meat Ball Bombs- \u00a0Crispy on the outside, warm and creamy on the inside.Burrata- Creamy burrata with sweet tomato slicesHoney Mustard Ribs-- MY FAVORITE DISH from Tapeo.. Ordered seconds!Chocolate Creme with Salt and Olive Oil- \u00a0I still dream of this dessert!Stuffed Squid-- So soft it just melts in your mouth. \u00a0Yes, it was THAT good.We went to a lot of different restaurants in Barcelona but this by far, stands out as one of the best meals I've ever had. \u00a0The honey mustard ribs..... my mouth waters every time I think of those. \u00a0The waiters are informative and have great recommendations. \u00a0There were 4 of us who ate lunch there. \u00a0With food and drinks, it came out to 100 euros. \u00a0This was VERY reasonable, considering we ate enough food for 6-7 people.",
