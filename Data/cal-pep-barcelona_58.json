    "We were walking by and had meant to give Cal Pep a try based on all the good reviews here on yelp and we were able right in and grab a seat with no wait. \u00a0I didn't have a menu but I used the Yelp photo's to order some things that looked intriguing. I'd recommend the razor clams, mixed fried seafood and gambas \"gloriously sweet plump red shrimp.\" \u00a0 The staff here was wonderfully helpful and hospitable as was Chef Pepe. The atmosphere is lively, people are excited and ready to chat as everyone is on vacation and having fun. We ended up sharing most of our food with the people sitting next to us just so we could try more stuff and not overeat or waste such amazing food. So if your in Barcelona hit this place. Just remember that you might be waiting a while and if that's not for you find out when they open and go a little early and be cool to the help and they will be quite cool to you! Cheers",
