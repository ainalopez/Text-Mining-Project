    "31 Euros... are you READY? \u00a02 AWESOME pizzas, a starter salad with tasty seasoned toast, a plate of delicious pasta (pesto with tomatoes), 3 desserts, 2 beers, 2 glasses of wine and a peach juice. 31 Euros! \u00a0Impossible you say? Well that was our lunch bill today. \u00a0Great service and top notch thin crust pizza. \u00a0I had the brie and spicy sausage and it was sublime - perfect crust. \u00a0The pasta while containing seemingly simple ingredients had layers of fairly complex flavors = great! \u00a0 If you are going to the Sagrada Familia do yourself a favor and walk away from the crud immediately surrounding the church, walk a few minutes and find this place - you will be glad you did.",
