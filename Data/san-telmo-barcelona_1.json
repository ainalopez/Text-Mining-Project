    "Quaint local spot with a variety of gins and vodka.The cocktail selection was a bit disappointing based on all the alcohol they have available.It was the normal Bloody Mary, mojito, tom Collins..etc. nothing too extravagant.The food menu had a variety of tapas and mains.The eggplant was a pleasant delight with honey glazed on top.The fried Brie was delicious and came with a light spicy sauce.Husband's passion fruit daiquiri was well made and my Hendricks and tonic was a generous goblet.Not bad for a little neighborhood spot.",
