    "I was persuaded by all the good feedback to check this place out with my boyfriend for our first tapas experience. Wow! We were greeted warmly despite not having reservations on a Saturday night. They even had one of the servers recite the menu in English when my Spanish did not hold up. Our favorite dishes were the eggplant and the veal with potato. Also enjoyed the homemade pie and spinach bolitas. Two glasses of red wine rounded out the meal nicely. In total, our meal was 40 euro including tip and we were VERY satisfied. Great service, cozy space, and amazing food.",
