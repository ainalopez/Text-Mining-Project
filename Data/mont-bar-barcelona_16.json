    "My favorite meal in Barcelona. \u00a0Outstandingly devoid of tourists. \u00a0Perfect lighting and decor. \u00a0I don't recall the names of what we had and couldn't find an online English menu, but there's a tuna dish on the medium size menu which comes out with a dome of smoke. \u00a0While you think it could be smoke in mirrors, it's not (if you like shishimi style tuna). \u00a0I highly recommend calling for reservations. \u00a0This place is tiny.",
