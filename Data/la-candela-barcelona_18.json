    "Was one of the best places I ate at in the Barcelona area. I had four items off the tapas menu, Ham and Chicken Croquettes, Jalape\u00f1o Crisp, Mozzarella and Marmalade, & Tomato Bread.It was fantastic. My favourite by far (and i still crave them) were the Ham and Chicken Croquettes.Staff was great, beer was great, food was great.Fairly expensive, but worth it.",
