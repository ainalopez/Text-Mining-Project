    "All around delicious & delightful! Tiny spot but 8p was an easy time to grab a table/meal. Friendly staff, great music, cute ambiance AND most importantly delicious food. We split the citrus juice & two \"sandwiches\" (millet/beet veggie burger & goat cheese/greens/balsamic sandwich) all of which were delightful. Yum! I want to eat more right now!",
