    "This was our favorite of the tapas bars we visited in Barcelona. \u00a0It's cozy, the food is excellent and the service was excellent. \u00a0We had the sauteed squid (the whole squid is sliced and laid out on the plate,), lamb and a vegetable dish. \u00a0We sat at one of the small tables rather than at the bar. \u00a0The server was pleasant and very helpful in answering questions. \u00a0I would definitely return and highly recommend it.",
