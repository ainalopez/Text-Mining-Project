    "Tourist friendly, amazing food, great service. We went there twice during our short stay in Barcelona and had a great experience each time. They make the best Bloody Mary I had in Spain. The Caesar Salad is SO good- how did they find a way to make a simple Caesar salad incredible?? The eggs benedict florentine had perfectly poached eggs, and the huevos rancheros was delicious. Definitely come to Milk- I miss it already!",
