    "What a place to refuel after Barcelona's half marathon four weeks ago! The juices taste amazing and contain lots of nutrients to give you plenty of energy. There are so many different sorts of juices that it's pretty hard to choose. The toasts taste like heaven as well, highly recommended. The place is really nice and fancy, although quite small. The \"minus\": service (for take away) took an eternity.. Otherwise, very nice place! Would definitely go back :-)",
