    "We had a great dinner here! We came late like 22.30 and the kitchen closes at 23.00. We have ordered before that but after that we also wanted to order more and the waiter was so so nice he said yes to whatever we asked for! This place has a friendly environment and we enjoyed our time there! The menu is quite rich, they have food for everyone!",
