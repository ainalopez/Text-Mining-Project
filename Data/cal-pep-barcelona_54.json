    "i give cal pep 4 stars since its a little cramped in there and they seem to profile the clientele and serve specific food depending on their assesment. also, we felt very rushed.it's definitely not a place to go to if you want specific food. make sure you tell them about food allergies and what you DONT want. if you dont want fried food or too much red meat, tell them. my husband and i got there 30 minutes before the restaurant was due to open and there was already a crowd of people waiting to get in. they opened their doors 10 minutes later than they were supposed and we were seated right away at the bar. their food is excellent.. and its a good place to go to sample catalonian cusine. pep came out to talk to the people at the bar which i thought was cool...if you leave your email address, they send you monthly recipes.",
