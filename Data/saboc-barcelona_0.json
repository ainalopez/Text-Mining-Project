    "We came here for dinner on our last night in Barcelona. We started off with a glass of cava, which was very good. We then ordered the risotto with shrimp and asparagus. The risotto is made with pasta instead of rice. It was one of the best dishes that we ate on our trip. The flavor of the sauce in the risotto was simply outstanding.We then ordered a mini burger with caramelized onions. The onions were good, but the burger was practically raw inside, so we did not eat all of it. Next up was the rigatoni with mushroom filling. It was also very good and had a crispy piece of cheese in it.We ended off with two chicken quesadillas. These were just okay.Overall, this was a great restaurant with good food, good ambiance, and good service. What a great way to end our trip to Barcelona!",
