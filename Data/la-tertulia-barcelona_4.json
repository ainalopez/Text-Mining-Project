    "An excellent place for lunch on Barcelona's best pedestrian street, the Rambla de Poblenou. Their three course lunches are great - my wife asked for a house red wine and the bottle came out to the table, as part of the meal.Portions were appropriate, and spectacular. Eat inside and hear the locals, or go outside and watch people ambling by. Definitely worth checking out.",
