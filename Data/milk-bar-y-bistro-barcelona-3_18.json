    "The food & service at Milk was the best dining experience we had in Barcelona. Bloody Mary is outstanding! Mojito very good & The passion fruit cocktail OK.Drunken prawns were the best we have ever had. The Vegetarian Antipasti platter, a vegetarian's delight, Nachos with Mexican beans, a taste bud explosion. Wow! All topped with great service & in a brilliant ambience. BTW we had the chocolate desert & 2 coffees too! Our bill about \u20ac63.",
