    "Ramen on vacation in Spain? Haha at first I thought it was a mirage. I begged my family to go in because they were reluctant to try, but they ended up loving it.The establishment is clean and the people are nice!My favorite dish would probably have to be grilled rice ball. I've never seen anything like it... And it goes great with the ramen! :3\u00a1Qu\u00e9 sabroso!",
