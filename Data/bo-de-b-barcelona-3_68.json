    "I have mixed reviews about this place. \u00a0The bread is very good and makes the sandwiches BUT the owner's service and attitude are both VERY POOR. \u00a0My husband and I wanted to order food to sitdown and we also wanted to take some food to go for our family back at the hotel but the owner would not let us do this. \u00a0He started raising his voice and told us to sit down or get out. \u00a0Reminded me of that episode of the soup nazi from Seinfeld :P.We ordered a burger sandwich and a chicken salad to sit and eat inside. \u00a0The beef was so undercooked so we couldn't even eat it. \u00a0Eventually one of the girls working there was nice enough to help us out (I wish I knew her name because she was the only helpful person there) and we were able to order 2 chicken sandwiches to go.The chicken for both the salad and the two sandwiches was overcooked and rubbery. \u00a0The only good thing that I remember was the bread for the sandwiches. \u00a0That, I do have to give credit to. \u00a0Bread was very good. \u00a0We came here on a high recommendation from a friend. \u00a0Would I stand in line for 20 minutes again to go to this place? \u00a0NO WAY. \u00a0Pros: \u00a0CheapCons: \u00a0Rude Owner, Undercooked Beef (I know you can eat beef on the red side but this was pretty much raw), Terrible Service",
