    "Probably one of the best quiches in Barca! (\"Pudding\" is the other one). And a very good menu del dia value! Menu is kinda limited but everything is consistently excellent. Dessert tarts etc are real French style and delicious. Place is small, modern, bright and cozy. Chef is real creative and nice. Too bad the guy behind the counter is always grumpy although he does know how to make a real espresso - something that's very hard to find in Barcelona.",
