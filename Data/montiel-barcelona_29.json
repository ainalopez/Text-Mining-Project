    "Loved the service and the food. Didn't get to try the suckling pig since I was in a group of eight though.The majority of the courses were very tasty and the servings were huge. However, the main course was a miss and the dessert was very simple. Despite those few flaws, I still give this place 5 stars because the entire experience was 5 stars.",
