    "The service was terrible. I made a solo trip here to have some dessert after dinner. Upon arrival, they ask me to sit wherever I want and that I would receive table service. When I do sit down, they tell me I can't sit at that table because it's for a party of 5. I find another spot and wait another 10 minutes before being given a menu. Once I receive the menu, I'm asked once again to move so accommodate a bigger group. Once I'm seated in the other spot, the server walks away and doesn't even take down my order. I had to come up and ask to order. On the other hand, the food is delicious. Just don't expect your service to be excellent.",
