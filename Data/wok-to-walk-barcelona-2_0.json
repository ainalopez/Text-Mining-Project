    "I LOVE WOK to WALK!!! I made my cousin take me here a couple of times cause I just could not get enough of the curry noodles my own combo steez. Every time I came I fell deeply in love with the place. Everything taste great. The workers are friendly and can talked to me in English. Yay for that. The place is small but thank God the place was not busy when I went there. I'm glad that the times I went there was a place for 3 adults and a kid with a stroller. The bathroom was clean. I wish they had one here in L.A. But for sure when I go back to BCN that is one of the 1st place to hit. Not just once but many times. And I hope my cousin is reading this... Yes you will take me here many times again.",
