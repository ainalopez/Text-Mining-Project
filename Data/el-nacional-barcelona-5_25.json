    "A unique concept: 4 main restaurants under 1 roof. We went to the brasserie, where I had an amazing veal dish with potato and pepper. Fabulous!The waiter didn't speak English, but was charming and funny (all waiters took orders on Android tablets, very smooth). All in all, excellent experience. 5/5!",
