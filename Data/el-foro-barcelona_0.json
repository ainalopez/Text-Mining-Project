    "The picture they have on here doesn't do the restaurant any justice. \u00a0Go to their website. \u00a0It's a really nice, cozy restaurant that feels like home (somehow). \u00a0Ample of space between tables so you can have your intimate dinner/conversation. \u00a0The food was great, too! \u00a0It was a couple of blocks from the flat where I was staying and I would have gone here for my lunch every day (if I was not all over Barcelona during the day).Will definitely go back.",
