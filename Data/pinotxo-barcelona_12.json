    "Perfection! \u00a0We first ate here in 2009 and again in 2015. Both times were culinary perfection.We had virtually every seafood item, plus garbanzos (made with pork). Food is really spectacular. There are only 26 seats and tons of demand, so you need to plan accordingly. We were there in October and on a Wednesday the whole town seemed to be slow, so we tried and had easy seating at 12:45 pm. This is an excellent experience for anyone with a sense of adventure. This is not fine dining or uptight service. This is great food in an informal environment.",
