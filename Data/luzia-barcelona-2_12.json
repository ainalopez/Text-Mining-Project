    "Perfect afternoon break. \u00a0We popped in after a day of sightseeing because it is so close to the Meridien. \u00a0The service was great and the place has a cool vibe. \u00a0I highly recommend the pizza to share. \u00a0Crispy crust and fresh taste. \u00a0We sat downstairs as we were between the main service times but upstairs seems nice also. \u00a0Delicious coffee and pastry for dessert too!",
