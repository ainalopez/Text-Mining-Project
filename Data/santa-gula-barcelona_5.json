    "Gula Gula Gula!Por fin the coulant is back!! This has motivated me to praise Santa Gula publicly, it was love at first bite and the love has continued over the years. It has changed a bit over the past few months, missing the charm of the two waitresses that left, but the coziness and the cuisine carry on strong~",
