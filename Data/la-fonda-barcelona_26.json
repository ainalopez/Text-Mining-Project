    "This was probably the best meal I ate in nine days in Spain, but that is a testament \u00a0not so much to La Fonda's excellence as it was to the mediocrity I encountered elsewhere. The sangria and salads were decent enough, but the seafood paella would be more accurately described as \" big tray of saffron-flavored Bomba rice,\" as the seafood was scant. I can't say that the meal was worth the long wait, either.",
