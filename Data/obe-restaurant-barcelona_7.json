    "Phenomenal menu del dia! The risotto, clams and spaghetti were amazing and the fish fish was so good...extremely fresh and very well prepared. So wrap it up the panna cotta was the best I've ever had (FYI I never order it lol...but still out of this world). Definitely stop in to this little gem by the market!",
