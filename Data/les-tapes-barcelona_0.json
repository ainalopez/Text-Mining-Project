    "I spent three nights in Barcelona and had a late dinner here all three nights. \u00a0Les Tapes was the closest bar to where I was staying in Barri Gotic. Some of these tiny bars can seem intimidating for the non-Spanish speaking tourist--full of men or full or locals. \u00a0However, at around 9pm, it was still a bit empty and there was a little old lady and a couple at the bar so I thought I'd take my chances. I tried to order in Spanish but I must have botched it because the owner switched to English. The little old lady was 91 and had moved to Spain from NYC 30 years ago. \u00a0She said that the owner was one of the best cooks in town. \u00a0She also said she liked Les Tapes because it wasn't a pick-up bar--hilarious! \u00a0Another \u00a0regular said it was an known ex-pat bar so English speakers feel comfortable. \u00a0Everything I had here was delicious, hearty, home-style comfort food. \u00a0Prices are incredible. \u00a0I typically had 2 glasses of house vino tinto + a full meal for under 10 euros. \u00a0Friendly staff and friendly locals. \u00a0The bar didn't stay empty for long. \u00a0By 10pm, the tiny place was standing-room only, especially on a game night.",
