    "We don't generally write reviews but after reading the recent review trashing Allium, I need to speak up. We went there for lunch \u00a0and received a warm welcome and a delicious variety of tapas. Our waitress was extremely personable and patient. Two days later we went for breakfast which was just as good. When we raved about the local honey, the chef came over, explained why it was so different and delicious, and presented us with a small container to take home. We have no hesitation in recommending Allium for good food at at a reasonable price.",
