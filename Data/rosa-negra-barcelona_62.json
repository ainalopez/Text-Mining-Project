    "I went with a couple of my friends on a Wednesday night around 8, and it was packed! It had a great atmosphere and the waiters were very nice and attentive. \u00a0Try to sit upstairs, it is much nicer and you get a great view of the restaurant. \u00a0What to get: 3.50 mojitos and margaritas, with a flavor if you want for no added chargeThe nachos, so good and there is a layer of beans under the chipsBBQ pork quesadilla, they put lots of cheese in these and you get threeYou must go!",
