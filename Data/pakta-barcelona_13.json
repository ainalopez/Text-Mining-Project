    "Amazing, inventive meal. Great service with quick and seamless expedited food service of our 18 course meal. The booze selection is varied and extremely affordable as well.I was extremely happy to have read about Pakta in the New York Times and that it opened up in time for my trip to Barcelona. I quickly made a reservation online (15 days in advance is the earliest from what I gathered though it may have changed since).There are only two prix fixe menus you can choose from, both of which are essentially the same, just one (titled the Macchu Picchu) has more dishes. My friend and I of course opted for the full menu at ~120 euros each amounting to 18 courses for our meal that night.I don't want to give away too much but our highlights were both kaiseki courses in their picturesque elegance and whimsy, as well as the ceviche and sushi courses.",
