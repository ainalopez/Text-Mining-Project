    "I hate to do this to my fellow Korean peeps, but this place was way overrated by previous Yelpers. I've had hundreds of Korean restaurant meals in the US (West and East coast), Korea, Middle East, even Africa. I am not a food snob and I want to give people the benefit of the doubt because I know the restaurant business is not easy.We had our usual tapas in Barcelona so we were craving some Korean flavor. Our family decided to go for lunch, and we were quite disappointed with the service and food. Supposedly they were short staffed due to the holidays, which I can excuse (there were other local patrons frustrated with the slow, inattentive service). But the food was definitely meh, which is really hard to excuse. The squid bbokum was the most flavorful dish we ordered, the hwe dup bab (sushi bowl) was OK. The dduk bboki was OK, but 12 euro for a mini tapas sized portion (seriously) and another 11 euro plus for a small order of jja jang myun (black bean noodles)?!?Barcelona has great seafood and fresh produce, so it was a shame that we overspent for a very mediocre lunch. If you are desperate for Korean flavor, go for it. But be ready to spend way too much for just OK Korean food.",
