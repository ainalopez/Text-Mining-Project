    "This sports pub always is one of my go to places for non-spanish sporting events. I've watched rugby, AFL, English football there. They are very good an ensuring the have what ever game that has been advertised on their website. ( The website is great to find out what games they have on btw)It's run by a older Catalan (guy) / English (girl) couple. She is fun and chirpy, and I've found him to be a little bit of the opposite. The food is poor and the young staff tend to always seem overwhelmed. As a venue to watch a game, it's great. Another else, it just doesn't come up to standard.",
