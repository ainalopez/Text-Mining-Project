    "Well known and very popular, this long, narrow bar sells Basque style tapas, washed down with (excellent!) Spanish cider. There's a large bar area at the front, and a more intimate restaurant seating area at the rear. Most people come here for the tapas, though: there's a huge range of the small pintxos style of tapa on cocktail sticks, and you pay by counting the number of sticks on your plate at the end. Arrive early in the day (lunch -times are good) as in the evenings it's heaving.",
