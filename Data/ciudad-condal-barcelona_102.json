    "A really fun restaurant with some pretty decent food right off of Passeig de Gracia, but damn is it busy! Don't go if you're super hungry, as you'll probably be waiting for a table for at least 30 minutes... more if you go on the weekend. \u00a0That said, once you get in, any sense of urgency disappears and you're set for the night. The restaurant itself is quite beautiful. Big chandeliers and a vintage motif play into the grandeur of it all; it feels like the kind of place the cast of an opera would dine after a late performance. As for the staff, they were super attentive and despite the line up pandemonium outside, didn't mind when we wanted to order more tapas. My one reservation is that it was a little pricey for what you get, but the atmosphere more than makes up for it.",
