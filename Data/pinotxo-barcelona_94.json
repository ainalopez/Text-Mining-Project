    "About the worst experience I had in Spain and almost ruined the trip. \u00a0First off, it was very hectic and was impossible to grab a seat. \u00a0Once I was able to get one, I sat down and ordered a beer and had a little breather. \u00a0 I saw the people next to me ordering a dish that looked good, so I tried to order the same dish from the waiter / chef (not the owner). \u00a0I was speaking in Spanish, but it was hectic and my spanish is not perfect, so I think he thought I don't speak any at all. \u00a0He half ignored me and proceeded to make something that was not the dish I ordered. \u00a0While waiting, my neighbors tried to intervene and correct him. \u00a0They then had a heated conversation, and he went ahead and remarked that I was American and should be dining at McDonalds instead of here. \u00a0 After getting the dish, he went ahead and made the correct dish and charged me for both of them (40 euros later). \u00a0 I've seen the good reviews for this place but can't say I had the same experience.",
