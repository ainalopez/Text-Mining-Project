    "We had lunch, we came back for dinner! That's pretty straight forward I'd say.Must try: appetizers! (Mushroom croquets; french bread with goat cheese and tomato spread). Salad was just ok, nothing special but the grill veggies was very good. Make reservation before coming as they can be very busy. Great staffs!",
