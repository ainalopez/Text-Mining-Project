    "After wandering around for a bit looking for a place to eat, we ended up here. \u00a0So glad we did. \u00a0The space is small, funky, charming as hell, and a really good combination of old and new. \u00a0The tapas were so good and \"alternative\" as advertised. \u00a0We went with the waitress's recommendation. \u00a0She was awesome. \u00a0Not your typical sweet, overly friendly waitress, but I kind of loved that. \u00a0Great spot.",
