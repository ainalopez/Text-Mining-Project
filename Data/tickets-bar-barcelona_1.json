    "Oh Tickets! What a disappointing experience. I think we had too high expectations since we:1. Are obsessed with the Adria brothers 2. Spent almost 6 days trying to make a reservation at 6:00 on the dot!3. We plan our entire Barcelona trip around eating here. We ordered the tasting menu and a bottle of wine. Don't get me wrong, the food is amazing. I believe people like Jose Andres and new up and comers like \"Disfrutar\" definitely get dishes/ideas/inspiration from the Adria's. But the service was terrible. No one paid attention to us, we had to wait long periods of time between plates and in the dessert room we were seated at a corner where once again, no one gave us direction. It was by far one of the worst services we've ever had. There wasn't enough airy waffles, or amazing jamon to take the horrible service back. That being said, I will definitely give you one more try someday.",
