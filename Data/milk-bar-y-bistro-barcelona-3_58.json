    "The Bloody Mary is a must have! Very busy, small restaurant that caters to traditional American-type brunch with a twist. We enjoyed the monte Cristo and juevos rancheros. The staff is very friendly and you can tell they have a true passion for what they serve. As another person recommended, we sat at the bar and watched the bartenders work their magic and also engage in conversations. Great meal",
