    "So i'm from San Diego, California where we have a huge Asian population and Ramen is a staple in my diet. After 4 weeks away from home one of the foods i was missing the most was my ramen. I didn't even think twice to research if Barcelona had ramen! One day my boyfriend and i were exhausted, grumpy, hungry, and wanted anything BUT tapas. After blocks and blocks of not finding anything appealing we looked down a little alley and saw \"RAMEN\" lit up in bright red. It was meant to be!The decor was super cute and it felt comforting seeing 2 happy Japanese families eating inside so i knew it had to be some-what legit... and it was. The ramen was authentic, noodles perfectly cooked, soft-boiled egg was just right, and the broth was delicious. Really, really, really wish i didn't discover Koku at the end of my stay.",
