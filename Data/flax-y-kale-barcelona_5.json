    "I want to love this place because I eat gluten free and they have tasty choices. However, the bad experiences keep rolling. Nothing to do with staff or the place but the food itself. I keep finding things that shouldn't be in my food. One time it was a maggot in my salad, the second time a stone larger than a rice grain. The first time I was dining in and they explained that their salad leaves come ready washed so there was not much they could do about it. They comped the plate and offered another dish for free - by that time I had lost my appetite. The second time was a take out.I have been to the restaurant many times with others and they reported experiencing stomach issues after eating. We continued eating here alternating the dishes to figure out the offender. This hasn't been my experience so I thought maybe it is specific to certain dishes although I have sampled most of the menu.Can't put my finger on it but I am concerned that they are lacking some quality checks.Their sister restaurant Teresa Carles was my all time favorite but even in that spot I have witnessed the kitchen staff taking garbage out and coming back to continue scooping out avocados without washing their hands. I'd hate to scratch this place off completely. I am leaving this review in case others are having a similar experience and they think they have just been unlucky. There is a pattern, hope they do something about it.",
