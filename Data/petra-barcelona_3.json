    "My friends took me to this delightful restaurant and we enjoyed an absolutely fantastic meal for under 8\u20ac. The ambiance is cozy and the waitstaff is friendly. The menus on the wine bottles is a clever idea! We ordered the Menu of the day and a beer...the fish was amazing. Stop in here if you get a chance!",
