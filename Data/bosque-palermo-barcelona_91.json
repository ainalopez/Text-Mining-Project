    "Bosque Palermo is an amazing find in a cool neighborhood, where on Friday afternoon the place is packed with locals. We had the best meal here: lettuce hearts with tuna, grilled baby octopus, and their amazing paella. Topped off with 3.75 euro bottle of their house white wine, and icecream cake drenched in whiskey. Truly indulgent, cheap, and delicious.",
