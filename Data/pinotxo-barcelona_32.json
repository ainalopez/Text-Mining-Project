    "Our lunch at Pinotxo was one of the most memorable meals of our stay in Barcelona. Pinotxo occupies a corner stall of one of the aisles of La Boqueria that seats about a dozen people. There are a handful of tables on the edge of the market that are far from the action at the counter too. The owner and a few employees work behind a counter that is barely wide enough for one person. We had to hover around like vultures at the counter until someone paid and left. There wasn't an English menu, so we looked at the ingredients behind the counter and the items being passed over the counter to other people and ordered from the owner with our limited vocabulary. \"Pulpo!\" \"Pescados!\" The owner was very obliging and clearly had a sense of humor. The two of us shared 3 dishes. (I made up the descriptions.)* Chicken with apricots and prunes - 9EURThe greasy chicken sauce was so tasty that I mopped it clean with bread. * Octopus with paprika and oil and roasted potatoes - 9EURExtremely tender octopus slices! * Salt cod with caponata - 11EURThe cod was perfectly flaky. The eggplant and other vegetables were tender and tasty. With the 1EUR bread charge and a few drinks, lunch came out to a total of 36EUR. Another reason I loved this place? My bf paid with a 100EUR bill. The owner gave him 14EUR in change and handed me the remaining 50EUR with a mischievous smile.",
