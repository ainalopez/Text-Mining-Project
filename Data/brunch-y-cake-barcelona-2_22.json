    "Basically for American tourists from what I can tell. Was looking forward to a great breakfast. The food looks amazing in the pictures. Unfortunately the taste just doesn't match. My eggs were soggy. And not very flavorful. \u00a0The \"bagel\" was fluffy bread with a hole in the middle. And the ham tasted off. Plus the cafe latte was the weakest coffee I've ever had in Europe. Huge disappointment.",
