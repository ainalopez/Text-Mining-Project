    "Vinitus, currently for me it's a best hidden \"Perl\" in Barcelona. The price / quality is more than adequate for a city like Barcelona and the service is quite excellent for a Tapas / wine restaurant. As regards as the food (tapas mostly) from the starters, Tapas and desserts everything tastes good and looks even wonderful. You can either seat inside or outside (more difficult) and in summer nights it will \"blast\" (in the good sense) your evening :-). Please be aware that no reserves are accepted by phone, so the best hours to visit are at 20h30 or later beginning at 23h00. So far I had always good experience at Vinitus and that's why I'm a huge fan of this place.Tip for Dessert: Try the torrija or the \"roscon borrachito\";Tip for Lunch / Dinner: choose always something from the \"Daily Menu\" (short piece of paper stick in the menu).",
