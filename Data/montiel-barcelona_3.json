    "Not food - An experience! \u00a0One of the best experiences I have had in 35 years! \u00a0I visited Montiel in 2012 and waited 3 years to come back as it was so amazing. So when I arrived today, the expectations were high... Surpassed! \u00a0This will be the highlight of my holiday! \u00a0The food was amazing, especially the Duck Ravioli and Suckling Pig. \u00a0The servers were the same as they were 3 years ago... the only thing more incredible than the food... the service! \u00a0Thank you so much Montiel for the experience!",
