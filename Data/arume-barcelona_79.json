    "Oh my goodness, this was one of the best meals we had in Barcelona. You should make a reservation for this place because they are very busy but they are so friendly and accommodating too. Service was so friendly. We never felt smothered or ignored. It was just right. The food was perfection. Blackberry mojitos are a must. We ordered the salmon tiradito, grilled scallops with smoked ham foam, Arume paella, and the cheese plate with Galician jelly. I don't have any criticisms or complaints. All the food was cooked wonderfully. We finished with some Galician port which was also splendid. There is a reason why all the Yelp reviews are raves. This really was one of the highlights of our meals in Barcelona. Definitely a place we would come back to the next time we are in Barcelona. Truly wonderful!",
