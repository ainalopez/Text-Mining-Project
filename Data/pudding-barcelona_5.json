    "You can't miss pudding if you're a fan of brunch and in Barcelona. First off the decor is cute and fun, great for kids and kids at heart! The service is good and the waiters are all very kind. Their carrot cake is amazing and you can't go wrong with any one of their quiches! My recommendation? Go up to the glass case by the cash register and pick out what you want! That way you get to see what looks appetizing.",
