    "Came here on other yelp reviews and was not disappointed. We ordered the minikilombo salad which was huge! So much food on one plate! \u00a0It also comes with 2 empanadas, a drink and coffee, all for 10.30\u20ac. \u00a0Definitely get the prosciutto and goat/Brie cheese with the potatoes (Around \u20ac7), chorizo or cheese and ham empanadas. The service was also excellent as our waiter spoke English and basically went through the whole menu with us.",
