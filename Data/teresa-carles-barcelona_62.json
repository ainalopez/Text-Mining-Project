    "Tucked away in the heart of one Barcelona's most popular streets and hidden amongst all the mediocre restaurants, Teresa Carles is like heaven on earth. Although vegetarian, the menu is so diverse that you'll forget what that thing called meat is. Everything is clearly marked vegan or gluten free. It was a nice change to be able to come here after 2 weeks of eating just everything in European. It was refreshing. There's a big communal table at the front that seems to used more for take out waiting than eating, as well as lots of seating inside. It feels like a big cottage, and the servers are very friendly and welcoming. . Every week there is a special, and it's written out on a lovely poster given in addition to the menu (which by the way is available for purchase if you love typography that much). \u00a0It's also shown on the display case in the front. You can have the starter and entree, or all three. The starter was a puree of cauliflower with no dairy and it was really good. For the main, I got the veggie lasagna, which was one large flat piece of home made pasta that was folded in such a way that layers are created, and filled with some tomato paste, and other delights that I was unable to identify. It was good. For dessert, got the chia cup - chia seeds soaked in coconut milk with fresh fruits. Chia seeds soak up a lot of liquid and becomes like a pudding consistency. I would love to come back here again.",
