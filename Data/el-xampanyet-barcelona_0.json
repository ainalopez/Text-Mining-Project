    "This place is legit. Best tapas we had in Spain, period. Be sure to try the garbanzos de tocino, which is chickpeas with bacon. They were so good that when I had them at lunch, I had to come back and get them again for dinner. Oh my god, I want more garbanzos de tocino. This place has a real locals vibe. The place was packed. Don't be afraid to go up to the bar and ask for a menu!",
