    "Very good and affordable restaurant on the Barceloneta beach. We enjoyed some tapas and a main dish for a Saturday lunch in the sun, and it has been a very pleasant time. While the service has been generally fast, it took them quite some time to bring us the bill though. Food quality was good and prices affordable, and there was also free Wi-Fi.",
