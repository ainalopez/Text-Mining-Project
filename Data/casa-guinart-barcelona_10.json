    "If you're lucky enough to stumble into the place as I did, consider yourself one lucky duck.Around 10am I walk by and see someone with a croissant and an espresso sitting on front of the place. Coffee and croissant looked good so I went in and ordered what she had. Well? Guess what came out instead (see pix). So of course, if THAT is their croissant I am ALL in. \u00a0See all my pix an jus sit down, get a glass of what wine and enjoy what this place had to offer. Last time I had food this good was at Spago's.",
