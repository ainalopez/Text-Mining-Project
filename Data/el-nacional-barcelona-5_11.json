    "The tapas section (the restaurant has 4 areas) has an inscrutable system where waiters emerge occasionally from the kitchen with random tapas items and if you want it, you flag down the waiter. Tapas selection is weak and just OK in quality. If you don't like seafood and your luck is poor you may go home hungry.This review only applies to the tapas section. We did not try the others.",
