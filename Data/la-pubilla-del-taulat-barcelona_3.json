    "Loved by the locals, this tiny tapas bar is outstanding. \u00a0The tapas are homemade and although the service can get slow depending on the time of day (it can get pretty busy and I believe it's family run), its worth the visit. \u00a0The coolest part of this pub is the adjoining wine store to its left. \u00a0It sells wine directly from barrels for takeaway, and the pub's self produced \u00a0bottles of wine.Great for an afternoon drink after the beach.",
