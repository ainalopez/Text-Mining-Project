    "OMG OMG!you pick whatever they have laying on ice, weigh it and cook it your way!!!!!!! Absolutely amazing. Our favorite was the grilled calamari with green sauce. No Frills, dont expect fancy decor, fancy anything. You order, they cook it and call you to pick it up from the window. We came here 3 times i think within a week's time.OMG.",
