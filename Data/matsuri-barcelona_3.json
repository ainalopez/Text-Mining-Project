    "By far, the best sushi I've had in Barcelona! SO good!! I wish I had found it sooner in my 3 month stay. \u00a0One of my favorite things with sushi restaurants is a selection of creative rolls. I went to 3 sushi restaurants in the Barri Gottic and only this one had creative rolls. Maybe not a ton, but definitely some cool ones. There was a delicious duck roll and the tempura battered salmon roll was perfect!  \u00a0Also, if you happen to be from a big city & you're used to being able to get whatever you want delivered, look no further! They deliver!! And they speak English, so it's perfect for ordering after a long day of strolling the city and you're in your hotel room and just want something that's not room service. Trust me, you'll be satisfied.",
