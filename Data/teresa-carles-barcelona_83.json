    "I love this place. Last night I was craving a salad. I knew I could count on Teresa Carles for a great one. I wasn't wrong: brilliant circle of goat cheese, bib lettuce, walnuts, pears, beets, honey vinaigrette, ftw! Clean, casual, friendly service, great food AND healthy - - it deserves six stars. Please don't be afraid of the vegetarian label if you aren't one. There are plenty of flavorful dishes here for you to try. They don't sacrifice flavor in their veggie endeavors. The pasta (pappardellisimi esp) is terrific. You will likely swear they put some meat in there somewhere. The flatbread is a perfect starter to share. And the soup... Yum. Great to take a chill off. Then don't forget dessert - cheesecake highly recommended. Enjoy all thus with nice wines or juices. How perfectly well rounded does that sound. Do your heart some good and head in.",
