    "I really like Maoz from visiting it in other countries and at its previous location in Barcelona. \u00a0This one, sadly, was disappointing compared to my other experiences. Having just come from Amsterdam a few days prior where the fries can come with curry sauce (YUM), I was heartbroken to see that isn't an option here. \u00a0I could tell that the fries I got were the day-old ones probably lurking at the bottom of the trough. \u00a0They were kinda soggy, kinda chewy, and very blah. \u00a0I didn't know fries were capable of tasting bad! Also, the olives aren't pitted. \u00a0Whyyyyyyyy. \u00a0You may as well put plastic bits in the food. I wouldn't go back to this particular location, but 3 stars cuz I love Maoz in general.",
