    "Don't Eat the Bread!Ok, I went here with my partner and a Spanish couple, based on positive reviews. We read on the English version of the website that two paellas can feed 3 people so it sounds better than some other places where they charge up to 20 euros per person. We get there and are seated immediately, but the waitstaff, who seems very snobby, insists that 1 paella serves 1 person. We start to panic as this blows our budget. Should we leave? Then the bread comes with 4 different olive oils to try. We finally settle on splurging with a bottle of the house white, one black paella and 2 of the house paellas.The wine was good, in fact it was the best part of the trip. To us, perfectly balanced between dry and sweet and very well-priced. The black paella was good, squid was tasty but overall it was very salty. The house paella was fine, not outstanding, the flavor profile was bland even in comparison to \"second-rate\" paellas I've had in the States. A paella we had the next day for lunch was better.Then the effing check came. The freaking mediocre bread cost 10 Euros! Bread in any little place in Spain is free! Like I said, this bread was nothing special. This place is not gross but it's definitely a ripoff joint for turistas. Do yourself a favor, do some research, take the metro away from the beach and ramblas, and eat some better tasting better priced food.",
