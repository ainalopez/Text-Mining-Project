    "no, no, no - unless we totally caught an off night then I would say save yourself a LOT of money and go somewhere else. \u00a0YES - the room is beautiful and the outdoor seating is nice but the service, while very friendly, was extremely slow and almost impossible to get their attention (adverted eyes). \u00a0Most of the food was NOT good. \u00a0Two of the three \"artisanal\" sausage were inedible and I can eat just about anything. \u00a0The steak tartar was mediocre at best (I have had at least 10 better tartars than this). \u00a0The cheese plate was pedestrian and uninspired. \u00a0The other dishes aren't worth mentioning. \u00a0I generally do not write poor reviews unless I think \"Joe Public\" should have a \"heads up\" especially when our bill topped out over $100 Euro for what amounted to 5 tapas, a couple of \u00a0beers and a glass of wine. \u00a0 We have had meals 20X better for a third of price in Gracia/Barcelona.",
