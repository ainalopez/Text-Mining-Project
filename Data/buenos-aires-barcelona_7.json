    "My friend and I dined at the Buenos Aires Grille two weeks ago and had a fabulous meal and very delicious cocktails. The atmosphere in the restaurant is so upbeat and the d\u00e9cor is rather attractive, much more than the \"Grille\" in the name suggests. We were especially happy with our waiter, Juan Bravo, who knew we were from out of town, and made us feel so right at home for our first night in Barcelona. The restaurant is in an upscale neighborhood of Barcelona, and after dinner there are many other upscale venues to continue your night out.",
