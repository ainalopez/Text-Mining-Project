    "Before I start my review, here is the tip of the year for y'all: Do not make a reservation more than party of 3. Just don't do it. It's a small spot and break your group into 2-3 people if you want to eat here. With that being said...We came to this restaurant as a party of 6 on a Saturday night (fail). We had a reservation for 10 pm which was late but it is a popular spot so we didn't mind as much. Come 10:30, we are still waiting for a table. Not so great, eh? That's where the Spanish hospitality kicked in. Arume has a sister restaurant, Cera 23, which is right around the corner and they share the same menu/kitchen. Cera 23 is just as busy as Arume and their menu is just as great. Arume's manager secured us a table at Cera 23 and also checked on us several times to make sure we were happily eating and drinking at location #2. He also treated our group with dessert samples on the house, which was a very nice gesture. So as a summary:1. Do not make a reservation for more than 2-3 people2. Service is great3. Dessert menu is full of amazing stuff so do eat dessert4. If you cannot make it Arume, try Cera 23",
