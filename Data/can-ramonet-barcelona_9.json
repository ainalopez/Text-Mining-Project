    "We stopped by here while walking in Barceloneta to have a drink. \u00a0It was pleasant enough, the service was slow, but I've come to expect that in Spain.We stayed because the food smelled so good and they had clams on the menu. 15 Euros for an appetizer was a lot, and it was appetizer portions. However it was delicious! The waiter couldn't be bothered to ask if we wanted anything else, like to order bread to soak up the sauce, so we ended up eating the sauce like soup with the clam shells.If they had been a bit quicker and cheaper we would have stayed and spent more money. \u00a0Effectively, they inspired us to go home and cook a big meal.The inside was spacious and seemed to cater to large tourist groups, English and German. \u00a0The plates of paella being served to tables of 10 smelled enticing. \u00a0The full tables and aroma told me that they were doing something right, if not for my mood that day.",
