    "When we got to Pinotxo the bar was full. We had to stand behind people and ready ourselves to swipe their chairs as soon as they stood up to leave. But it was an authentic experience. It was loud and chaotic (the place is in the market) and the men behind the bar were full of gusto and charisma. The tapas was delish - the chickpeas were a favorite with us. If you want to get amongst the culture, this is where it's at.",
