    "Catalan cuisine in a nutshell: pretty good Mediterranean food, not terrible prices, slow service, non-stop Vichy.I came with friends old and new for a late Spanish dinner a few weeks back. The place was buzzing with energy, probably because there was a massive party of 25+ occupying most tables. They appeared to be deep in celebration by the time they shattered the third glass on the stone floor. But I digress...We ordered tapas to share: some jamon, \u00a0chorizo, a nice green salad, pan con tomate, all fairly standard. Service was slow and we thought twice about ordering an after-meal cocktail because it would have meant committing to another hour there.I like this place and love to see new businesses opening up in Raval, but it was 3, max 3.5 stars in my book.",
