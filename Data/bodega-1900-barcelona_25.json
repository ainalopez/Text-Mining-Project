    "I studied abroad in Barcelona for 3 months and Bodega was the best Tapas place I encountered. \u00a0I want to preface that it is not a cheap eat. \u00a0The tapas are pretty small in comparison to what you might find at other spots, but it's worth the slightly pricier menu. \u00a0We always stuck to the classics and were not dissapointed. \u00a0The best patas bravas for sure with a layer of flavors and nicely thin cut potatoes. \u00a0The star of every meal is the squid mollette. \u00a0Similar to a calamari hot-dog or like the calamari sandwiches you find in Madrid, but so much better! \u00a0After my first bite, I ordered another before the waitress left the table. \u00a0The place isn't super fancy to look at and the hours are a little random, but the amazing food and superb service make this a must! \u00a0Sad to be back in the U.S. and not within a walk of this spot anymore =(",
