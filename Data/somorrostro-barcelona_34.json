    "We didn't have a reservation and waited for 20 mins-I chose to wait based on the reviews and it was worth it. The food was delicious, the wines were exquisite and very well priced. We us five different tapas including the skate fish with chorizo, lonja with vegetables, papatas bravas (their version is not fried), and we had another dish with garbanzo beans and chicken. For dessert we tried the Lemon cake- it was okay, more like a pound cake with lemon zest. The service was awesome and so was the ambiance. Would definitely recommend this to others in the area! You won't be disappointed. Overall we spent around $48 for a great meal with 4 glasses of wine.",
