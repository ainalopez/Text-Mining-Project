    "COME EARLY! I was so sad when I went later in the day and the xiuxus were gone. They are incredible-even cold. And he is so sweet we ended up tipping a lot, as I'm sure most do. The tortilla espanolla (?) lacked flavor and the cafe con leche has cold milk... So that was a bummer. If you are used to lattes with steamed milk make sure to say caliente!!!!",
