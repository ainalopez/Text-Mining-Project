    "The lady here thinks her sh*t doesn't stink. You sit me in the corner behind your menu and look at me as if I'm burdening you by asking what you recommend. The menu are little cards on top of a wall and they are all overlapping each other, so of coarse I'm going to ask you what they say since I can't see them entirely. The food was not bad but everything must be pre-cooked since everything that is hot was put into a microwave before serving. Very strange, unhelpful and unfriendly.",
