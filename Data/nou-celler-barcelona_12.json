    "After looking for a good tapas place following our visit at el Museo de Picasso, we saw this little place. It looked cute and cozy so we decided to check it out. Once we got inside we decided to sit down stairs in the cellar which was a nice ambiance. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. We ordered various tapas and wine. The tapas were all terrific except for the calamari rings which were too large and chewy for me. The house wine was low in cost and great! I'm hoping to go back again before I leave Barcelona and would recommend it 100%!",
