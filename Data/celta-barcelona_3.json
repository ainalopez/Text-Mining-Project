    "This tapas bar specializes in tapas from Galicia, and they serve their wine in bowls! They pour the first bowl and you refill as often as you like (they will tally up the total at the end). There are three long counters with choices of traditional tortillas (in Spain this is a potato quiche), sausages, fried fish and seafood like calamari or shrimp,potatoes, croquetas (fried potatoes with crab, cod, ham, or cheese), razor clams, langoustines, and the best baby octopus, all grilled to order in garlic and olive oil. \u00a0The razor clams were tender and fresh, but only whetted my appetite for more,like the grilled baby octopus, which was the best version I've ever eaten. \u00a0I love smelt but these were too big and fishy (I found much better ones a block away). \u00a0Of the croquetas, I preferred the cod to the ham, even though both were good.The total for two of us sharing four tapas with four drinks (the sodas cost twice as much as the wine which was only 1.20 Euro a bowl) was 36 Euros or about $42 USD. The plates here are fairly large portions, so order as you eat, or just get a plate of the grilled octopus.",
