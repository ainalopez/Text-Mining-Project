    "I'm here at this restaurant as I write this, ordered the Paella con pollo y verduras (for minimum 2 people) and it was SO GOOD! I've eaten at a couple of other restaurants in Barcelona and I was completely satisfied with this restaurant! Ended my meal with the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was very good. I recommend this place who is looking for delicious spanish food!",
