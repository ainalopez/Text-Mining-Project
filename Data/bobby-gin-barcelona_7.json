    "Excellent drinks in a delightfully decorated little space. Our server walked us through the menu and listened to our preferences before suggesting pairings. They clearly are serious about their gin. I had the Monkey 47 Slow Gin with Heritage Indian tonic. A wonderful cocktail. My wife had Bobby's Spring which was equally as delicious. No food this time around, but how they have set up the offerings is original. New twists on old classics.",
