    "This place was our last meal in Barcelona and that was great with us! \u00a0The food was really really good. \u00a0Its unassuming, small, quirky and perfect. \u00a0Highly recommend stopping in here and sitting at the small bar, chatting up the amazing staff, having a wonderful cocktail and eat something for sure. \u00a0The food was such a pleasantly fantastic surprise.",
