    "Very cute and original caf\u00e9, worth a visit for the cozy vibe, professional and old-school service, and delicious treats. The snacks and drinks are not overwhelming or super fancy - but it is all good, and not very expensive. The xurros are sweet and crunchy as they should be, and the tea and coffee is standard. The cheese toast is very simple, but very good! This historical place is for sure worth a visit for a morning or afternoon break.",
