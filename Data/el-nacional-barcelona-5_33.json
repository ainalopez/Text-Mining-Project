    "Super nice location and variety choice of food! The restaurant with extraordinary decorate gives great ambience for leisuring and taste nice tapas there. Although the price is a bit expensive but I am totally amazed by the way the waiters serves hot tapas, they walk around tables and asking your willing to have a dish.",
