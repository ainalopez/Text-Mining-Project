    "We had a great meal here. Pasta is excellent, fresh, authentic, though not Spanish. We were tired of the same tapa offerings at bars in the city and ventured here for our last meal on a 2 week stay in Barcelona. The atmosphere is welcoming, the tables comfortable and the service friendly. If you've eaten much in Barcelona, you know the service can be quite unfriendly at worst and harried even at best. We had a creamy, lovely burrata, too, which I highly recommend. Cava was good. We paid a little more here than most places we ate and enjoyed every minute of our leisurely 2 and 1/2 hour lunch.",
