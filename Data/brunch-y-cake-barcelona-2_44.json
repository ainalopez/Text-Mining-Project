    "I\u00b4ve been here several times since I\u00b4ve been in Barcelona. Every time, I\u00b4ve gotten something new and I have not been disappointed. I highly recommend any of their egg dishes, and if you love salty and sweet, get their waffles and eggs benedict! Their orange juice is so refreshing, and the atmosphere is very relaxing.Most of the time, we receive excellent service. The waiters and waitresses understand we have bad Spanish, so most are good at English. However, we had a case where some friends were late at meeting us, so they went inside the cafe to explain to us first and then grab a seperate table. The hostess immediately snapped at us, which is understandable, because I would be frustrated too. She was also nice enough to let our friends get a table right next to us.... However, she proceeded to talk bad about us in Spanish to her coworkers, when the friends who were late could speak fluent Spanish and understood everything she was saying. We were close to walking out, but we felt a little bad about the mess we already caused, and we had already waited over thirty minutes for a table.Other than that one bad experience, Brunch & Cafe is a definite must go.",
