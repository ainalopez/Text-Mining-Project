    "The Jamon Iberico sandwhich here is fantastic (ham). the obsession with good quality ham in Spain means that we as consumers are in luck, because we are served some of the finest Jamon in the world. The cafe/restaurant is in a great location, having both indoor and outdoor seating, fun to people watch while enjoying great food. They also have a Catalan pizza that is interesting, and some good cheese plates and salads. The service was very welcoming and friendly, we will be coming back soon",
