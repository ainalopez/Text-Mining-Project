    "We were desperate for some sushi on a hot afternoon. Yelp helped us find this little restaurant. The food was great!! Totally hit the spot. Fresh, quick. Friendly. One point to remember is that they don't have an English menu so we ordered indiscriminately. Turned out to be great nonetheless!! The restaurant is clearly set up to be a take-out place. Their seating is basic but friendly.",
