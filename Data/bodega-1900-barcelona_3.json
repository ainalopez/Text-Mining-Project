    "My wife and I recently spent a week in Barcelona and this was the best restaurant we went to. \u00a0We had 12 dishes in all plus vermouth and espresso. \u00a0Nearly all of the dishes we had were amazing. \u00a0Most notably the white asparagus, I am a huge meat eater but this asparagus dish truly blew me away. \u00a0I absolutely loved it. \u00a0We also had the best steak in our lives here, the tenderloin cooked al carbon. \u00a0We normally prefer strip steaks or rib eyes but this place works magic and somehow made this tenderloin the best steak we had ever had. \u00a0The gamba shrimp is amazing as well. \u00a0The olives of course are a must have. \u00a0Desert was incredible too but I could not tell you what it was - it was long and flaky and filled with some kind of cream. \u00a0Every dish was done masterfully here, we would definitely come back. \u00a0Now a few things to consider depending on your tastes:The vermouth is very similar to straight Martini red/rosso but pairs well with their food. \u00a0I am not a big fan of their stews - we had the lamb cheek and also the peas and mushroom. \u00a0But I am not a big fan of stews to begin with.Now I wish we had gone to their big sister restaurant across the street: Tickets. \u00a0Definitely next time.",
