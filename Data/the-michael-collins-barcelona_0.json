    "When I travel, one of the first things I look for is a solid Irish Pub. \u00a0In my experience, Irish Pubs are a bit like little embassies for the English language and a good glass of whiskey. \u00a0I am definitely not the type of traveler who expects countries to conform to my tastes (what would be the point of traveling?), but during extended stays overseas, there are those points where you just want a good conversation in your own tongue, a couple of politically incorrect jokes, and to reconnect with other people of similar backgrounds who are traveling as well. \u00a0For me it is a great way to recharge the batteries and to keep a good attitude whilst being a guest in another's country. A good Irish pub fulfills this role like no other, and the Michael Collins is a great Irish Pub. The bartenders are fantastic, up for a witty joke, tips about Barcelona, conversation about politics and Europe, or to leave you to yourself over your drink. \u00a0Tips are certainly appreciated, and a little respect towards the house and bartenders will be rewarded with a good time. \u00a0One of my friends forgot his jacket one night and we were delighted to see they found it and held on to it for him despite our being there only a couple of hours our first time in. \u00a0Really great people work at this place. \u00a0Also, probably the cleanest taps and tastiest Guinness this side of Ireland. If you are a Barcelonan looking for a real Irish pub experience or a weary traveler looking for an evening somewhere perhaps a little more familiar to collect yourself before the next adventure, the Michael Collins is a great choice for a dram or a pint.",
