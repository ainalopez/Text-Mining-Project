    "Food: 5 starsService: 0 starsGreat location directly on the beach. The menu sounds great and has some nice twists. And it also tastes great. The atmosphere is classy-casual with white table clothes and nice napkins. So that's wonderful. However I have to say the service was more than terrible. The waiter couldn't care less. His appearance and his rudeness really didn't fit into this place and made our lunch unfortunately a painful experience. Too bad.",
