    "A much more touristy tapas places, yet with this much variety I'm willing to forgive it.So. Many. Tapas. Restaurants. Barcelona certainly knows how to impress, it would figure that even the chain tapas places are excellent too. Bilbao is the perfect place if you're visiting from out of town or out of country, with an inviting atmosphere, plenty of seating, and tapas places as far as the eye can see. The billing is similar to other tapas places - you're charged around 2 euros per tapas, which is counted by the waitstaff by the amount of toothpicks at your table. The sangria isn't bad either. Why we don't have more of these in the United States I'll never know, as you can eat as much or as little as you want. If you want the maximum variety of tapas possible, or a starter Tapas place after that 11 hour flight from the States, Bilbao Berria will exceed expectations.",
