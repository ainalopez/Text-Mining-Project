    "The prices were reasonable (half what we paid the for prior night's dinner at another tapas bar). The cod and the ham&cheese fritters were very good. We also had an excellent sausage dish with white beans. Honestly, I have a hard time distinguishing good from great tapas, but enjoyed the food thoroughly. The service was indifferent. The place also feels a bit somber compared to livelier tapas bars nearby.",
