    "In my favorite quarter of Barcelona, the RAVAL, lies a jewel! The Veggie Garden was buzzing yesterday (Sunday) at 3.30pm, we snatched one last table on the 1st floor! It looks so small from the outside, but there is some more seating upstairs.People are hippy and hip, they are international and relaxed! And yeah!!! A menu just for us veggies!!!!! I was in crisis.....so much to choose from, so little time... ok, veggie burger for me, different sauces available, Thali for my partner. We also ordered an ecological beer and a Smoothie. Both tasted just fine :)Oh, how I enjoyed sitting there, caught up in the lazy Sunday-bohemian mood....Food came quickly and we happily digged in.Ask the staff for their favorites, when you are undetermined, they are glad to advise.Best part of it all: the bill! 14,00\u20ac for 2 people. Crazy stuff!Everybody: come in and support this cute, local business!",
