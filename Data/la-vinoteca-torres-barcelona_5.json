    "This is a great place to grab some regional wine; they also have wine from the rest of Spain and elsewhere. \u00a0It is a combination wine shop and bar. They have a great selection and the prices were fairly reasonable, depending on what you want. \u00a0The staff was extremely friendly to us and with our limited knowledge of good Spanish wines they pointed us to some great wines to try. \u00a0They were very knowledgeable about their inventory.",
