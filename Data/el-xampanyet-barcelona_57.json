    "Without question one of the best eating experiences of my life! \u00a0We walked in and were immediately wary - too crowded, too small, nowhere to stand.However, the manager (owner) beckoned us in and pointed to a 4-foot strip of empty space up in front by the tapas bar. \u00a0We squeezed in and he'd poured us each a beer before we were in place, then we started in on the tapas. \u00a0It was a blast - the food was great, and very distinctive - but it was awesome. \u00a0Some of the seafood (clams) came out of cans which could initially be off-putting, but it was great.They had really good sliced ham, anchovies, omelette.The best, without question, was something I was going to skip. \u00a0The owner(?) offered us dessert, but we were stuffed - we gave in and he made us this small plate of 3 different cookies / biscottis / cakes that looked like someone's grandmother had made it - plus a dessert wine to dip it into. \u00a0It was amazing.We had a blast, we will be talking about it for a long time.",
