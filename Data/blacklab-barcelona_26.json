    "This gem of a beer hall opened in late 2014. We stumbled on it on a work trip and used it frequently as it provided multiple top-quality alternatives to the otherwise ubiquitous Bud Light-esque local beers. The owner, a young Duluth, MN transplant, is a friendly, skilled brewmaster. Though it takes a backseat to the amazing brews, the food is also delicious.",
