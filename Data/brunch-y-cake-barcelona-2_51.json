    "Super cute cafe!! I wanted to have a cute brunch since the weather was nice andcame here after seeing reviews and was not disappointed. I've had some great brunches in Portland, LA, SF and New York and this was a great rustic-chic cafe. It's definitely French inspired in terms of the dishes and decor, all the servers were even wearing suspenders! I had a cinnamon cappuccino with the breakfast combo which was a salad, potatoes, poached eggs and a panini with figs and brie. The brie was perfectly melted and the figs had a wonderful jammy sweetness. It was great!The presentation was cute and we sat right by the window. I believe there's a 10% fee if you sit outside!",
