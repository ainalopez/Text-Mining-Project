    "Perfect little spot for delicious bites and great drinks! We arrived in Barcelona mid-week and made this our first meal in the city. As both first time visitors to Spain, we were delighted by the awesome and friendly service.Now for the food: we ordered the nachos, chicken fingers, patatas bravas and calamari. Many glasses of cava. The food was great - chicken fingers had a curry vibe going on with what we think was a cornflake crust. Calamari was light and melt in your mouth.Best of all? All of that for around 30 euro...and server brought us free shots! We ate at two other spots in this area of Raval, and this was by far the best. Go here!",
