    "They're known for their fried egg with squid dish (huevos con chipirones). The egg is runny, and nothing tastes better than a dish with a runny yolk. I came here since it was recommended to me and it didn't disappoint. I love squid (even the non-fried calamari kind) and it was amazing. This was the best squid I've ever had. You will pay a bit more for the dish - around 20 euros - but totally worth it! The sandwiches and patatas bravas were also really good.",
