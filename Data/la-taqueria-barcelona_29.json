    "We closed off the night here after a visit to La Sagrada Familia. Excellent drinks which were well needed after my friend took the bowl of super hot salsa as a personal challenge. Very friendly staff and all our dishes were excellent. \u00a0Would definitely recommend. \u00a0They can be crowded so you may want to call ahead for a reservation.",
