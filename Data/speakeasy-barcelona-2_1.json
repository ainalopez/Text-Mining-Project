    "If you order anything, get the Cantonese lacquered wild Iberian boar. It was the most delicious pork I've ever had, how those Chinese ribs should taste, with some lobster in a light citrus foam, mouth watering. Just the house salad is delicious with Catalan's local treasure of olive oil and vinegar. I had a chilled melon soup and a freshwater fish baked with scalloped potatoes and green beans and a green garlic pur\u00e9e. It was all of my favorite Spanish tapas with a bottle of Rioja, the house martini and vermouth to start, a perfect kickoff to the week.",
