    "If you are a tourist, don't go here even if you're really excited about tacos unless you know Spanish quite well. It took about 25 minutes before the server initiated any interaction with me, took about 20 minutes to bring me my drink, food came out at a decent time, but it sucks being somewhere, where the server asks what you want then asks people after you and they get their drinks right away. I was excited about going to this place and although the pastor tacos were good, the service wasn't redeeming enough for me to want to recommend this place.My margarita tasted like there was absolutely no tequila. It tasted like sugary limeaid. \u00a0After I ate my food, I went to the restroom to find out my drink had been cleared and people had been sat down at my table. Overall, just a bad experience. Will never return to this place.",
