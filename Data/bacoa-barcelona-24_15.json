    "The burger itself, talking about just the meat, was probably the worst burger I've ever had. Do no go here looking for a good quality burger by American standards. It was definitely frozen at one point and a mix of some other meats. ABSOLUTELY NOT 100% real beef. The fries and the beer selection are really good and the interior is nice and the workers are friendly, but I ate about half of my burger and then tried my girlfriend's burger and I wanted to throw up it was that bad.",
