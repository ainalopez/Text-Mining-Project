    "Very nice rustic place. \u00a0Wood all around, \u00a0some big screens for thw sport. \u00a0Many burgers, \u00a0pastas and pizza. \u00a0Pasta was very basic and sauce a bit meager and the burger looked decent but not as juicy as wanted. However i am sure it is a great place to go with some friends, \u00a0watch some sports with a beer and some food. Prices very decent. \u00a015 euro for 2 people lunch and drinks",
