    "This restaurant was as good as advertised. \u00a027 euro for a complete meal. \u00a0Everything was cooked perfectly and the service was very friendly. \u00a0The staff even explained the proper way to eat the bread and tomato before dinner. \u00a0Much higher quality food than most good restaurants in the states. \u00a0Menu is in English which helped, but the waiter explained everything. \u00a0I would recommend it to travelers for a relaxing evening away from more crowded restaurants.",
