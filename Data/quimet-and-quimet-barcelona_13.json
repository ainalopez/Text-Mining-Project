    "I feel bad for New York City tapas restaurants. Why? Because after eating at Quimet & Quimet no less than four times in three days, I've decided I'm never eating small plates anywhere else but Spain ever again. I didn't realize how wrong they were doing it stateside until now.For starters, this is one of Ferran Adri\u00e0's favorite stops in the city. I could end the review right there. If he puts his seal of approval on anything, you know it's legit. But unlike his Ticket's Bar located just down the street, Quimet & Quimet is accessible to anyone without fear of maxing out your credit card. The menu is extensive and inspiring with something for everyone. I spanned the culinary spectrum with everything from foie gras on toast with black sea salt, lamb cheeks with patatas bravas, orders of mussels and clams, anchovies coupled with olive and tomato tapenade, and my favorite dish of the bunch, the smoked salmon with Greek yogurt, truffled honey, and balsamic vinaigrette atop a crisp crostini. So simple, yet so incredibly satisfying. You must get this when you stop by.The best part of the experience is watching the chefs prepare your meals. Not unlike the steps a bartender makes when assembling your multi-ingredient cocktail of choice, they're situated behind a small food bar, and as you order, they whip it together and hand it to you within moments. It happens so fast that if you blink you'll miss it. It's so carefully orchestrated, it's got the efficiency of a Cape Canaveral rocket launch. It's an incredible site to behold, and an even better treat for your tastebuds.You'll eat standing up and the place is routinely crowded, so tread accordingly. But eating on two feet while rubbing elbows with tourists and savvy locals alike is part of the experience. A truly remarkable experience at that.",
