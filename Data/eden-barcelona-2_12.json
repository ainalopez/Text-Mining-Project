    "Such a wonderful and hidden gem in Barcelona. I visited Eden with my wife and 3 children (age 2,6,8) and we were starving for good pizza. Not only did we get delicious pizza in a great atmosphere, but we were amazed by the friendliness and warm welcome by the staff. Playing with the children and being super warm and friendly to us all. The kids loved them and so did we. All customers visiting was greeted with a genuine varmth. This just has to be a family business. We wish them the best and looking forward to our next visit!",
