    "Delicious! Their set menu was only 59 euros but we didn't go for that as we weren't that hungry. I got the duck with cut shark and it was delicious. The duck was cooked perfectly. We also had amuse bouche which was black pudding tatin with celery and it was amazing. For dessert we had the peach Melba which was ok. If u like cooked peaches with shaved iced and sorbet, then it's is for you. We also had a pallet cleanser which was wasabi, lemon and apple. Very interesting.",
