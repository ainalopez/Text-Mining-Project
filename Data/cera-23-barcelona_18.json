    "Came here spontaneously after watching FC Barcelona defeat SD Eibar 3-1. Walk back toward hotel and decided on having some tapas food. Found Cera 23 through Fodor's Travel Barcelona.After reading reviews on Yelp, I decided to get Blackberry Mojito. It was black and had a few fruits on top. I think it might have been the best tasting Mojito I've ever had l! It was so good, that I had to get a second! Cervache - with White Sea Bass, cilantro, mango, lemon, salt and black peppers. Absolutely sublime \u00a0and can't get rid of the after taste. Lamb was very easy and no need to work the meat. It was also delicious. Sitting at the bar, easy service!Last but not least, why not a 3rd drink - Irish Coffee! Good stuff and would come back in a heartbeat!",
