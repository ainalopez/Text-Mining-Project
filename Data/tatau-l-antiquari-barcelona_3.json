    "i had hummus for starters, rabbit (i only ever eat it at my grandmother's, i think i've never seen that on a restaurant menu before) und a chocolate cake. with some wine to drink i still paid less than 25\u20ac and everything tasted spectacular :Dthe waitress was very friendly, translated the whole menu to english for us and read every wish from our lips.after almost two weeks of eating out in barcelona and madrid, this was definately a highlight.",
