    "In our first night in town, we tried a tapas bar just off the Royal Plaza (Playa Real). It's called Bodega Biarritz and is insanely small. My apartment living room is almost bigger than the seating space here. Their menu is one of pretty \"classic\" tapas dishes so a perfect way to start the trip.We started with an order of Patatas Bravas, a stuffed puff pastry and Cod Fritters. Patatas Bravas are fried potatoes covered with a spicy tomato \"Bravas\" sauce. The sauce is really the thing here.... tangy at first but quite spicy in the finish. The puff pastry is good as well but nothing special. The cod fritters were wonderful - nice, fresh cod meat with a nice crispy exterior.Next up, we ordered meatballs on top of a potato tortilla, grilled sausage and smaller meatballs covered in bravas sauce. Both meatballs were moist and tender. The sausage had a nice kick to it and the potato tortilla was great. Soft interior with a crisp exterior, the texture was much flakier than your usual corn or flour tortilla. Add to all of this some beer and a great Mojito and you have a wonderful introduction to true Spanish tapas.",
