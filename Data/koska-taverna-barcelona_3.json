    "I really don't understand why this place has such glowing reviews. We visited Koska because of Yelp and ordered a few pintxos but were quite disappointed. The jam\u00f3n had way too much mayonnaise, the cod was dry and flavorless, and the stewed beef we ordered was tender but flavorless as well-- with an overly gooey sauce. The beef was definitely a rip-off for 9 euros, especially compared to the great pintxos you can get in the area.Don't waste your time here; Tasqueta de Blai or Quimet y Quimet are much better for the same price.",
