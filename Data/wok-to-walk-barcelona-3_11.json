    "This place is a quick noodle house with a customisable menu. I always took it \"to walk\" but occasionally you'd see some people dining in on some decent dinnerware--noted.Now, I know it's weird to come to Barcelona and have Asian food, but when you live there for a while, chances are you'll crave it at some point (especially if you're Asian and don't feel like cooking).In that case, come to Wok to Walk! I loved it. My favourite combinations were 'spinach, bacon & Saigon sauce' and the 'chicken, broccoli and tokyo sauce'. It says Tokyo is a teriyaki sauce, but it's much more mild in my opinion (milder the better if you've tried American teriyaki sauce). However, my husband and I mixed and matched a bunch and it's pretty hard to go wrong--at least we didn't find a mix we didn't like.All locations are pretty standard.",
