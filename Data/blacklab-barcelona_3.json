    "On the hunt for some craft beer in Barcelona we ended up at BlackLab for a brew after finding it on the Yelp app.They had a lot of IPAs...like more than I'm used to seeing... but I found a porter that hit the spot. It was toasty, with some nice roasted notes, good mouthfeel and overall super solid. I also sampled a couple of the others - a red (maybe?) and an IPA. I'm not much for IPAS (although, they are growing on me slowly but surely) and both were good.Super nice staff - the fella behind the bar chatted us up a bit and walked us through the menu. Waved us off as we were headed out. It's always such a huge impact when the staff is friendly - and real basic things can make or break an experience. These guys get it.The brewery is visible from the tap room, behind a long wall of glass. There are various tables and large windows over looking the street. There's also a really cool mural along the two walls of Barcelona with all the notable landmarks painted on it. The feel here is like a cool coffee shop, except they are serving beer instead of cafe.The wife enjoyed some wine as well, so it's nice they have options for the non-beer drinkers.",
