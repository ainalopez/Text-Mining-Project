    "Really 3.5 stars. The location in the middle of the Plaza Real and its gorgeous outdoor terrace is the best thing the restaurant has going for it. Given its location, it's unabashedly for tourists, but it delivers in some great food options and is surprisingly affordable. We went twice during our stay in Barcelona given its great outdoor seating and price point. The black rice (squid ink rice) is delicious and packed with seafood flavor. Patadas bravas and cheese croquettes are pretty good as well. We tried the paella which was subpar and seemed like it didn't have any saffron flavor or color. Cod fritters weren't great either. Price point was excellent - a meal consisting of 2 tapas, a big rice dish, and a pitcher of sangria cost around 35 euros. Come here for the outdoor seating, people watching, black rice, and cheap sangria! Just don't expect the most gourmet meal, but as far as tourist restaurants this is a pretty good option.",
