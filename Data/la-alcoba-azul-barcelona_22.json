    "My review for this place is long overdue. \u00a0Since I discovered it about a month ago, I've become a regular customer. \u00a0This cozy restaurant & bar has a fantastic selection of tapas, salads, and toasts (flatbread pizzas). \u00a0They also have a small but tasty selection of wines, and put lots of care into their mixed drinks as well. \u00a0The enormous gin & tonics are served with a dash of fresh ginger and has juniper berries floating among the ice.The menu is not your classic list of tapas, as the kitchen is very tiny so they only have an oven. \u00a0No deep fryer means no patatas bravas, but there's no shortage of tasty treats. \u00a0My favorite is the stuffed peppers with goat cheese and jam, the pan con tomate with extra spices, and of course you can't go wrong with the jam\u00f3n iberico.Remember this place is small, so be prepared to wait for a table if you're going during peak meal times. \u00a0They only have one table that seats more than 4 people, so call ahead to make reservations for a group.",
