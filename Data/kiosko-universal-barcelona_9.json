    "Very VERY happy with the food here. Happened to walk up when 2 seats were empty. Mostly locals with a couple of tourists. My boyfriend and i split the gambas (6 large shrimp) and the sauteed mushrooms. And wow... it was a wonderful mix of mushrooms, some of which I had never seen. A little oil heavy for my taste, but that does seem to be the style in general. Regardless, the food was fantastic. The shrimp seemed really fresh. \u00a0Left with big smiles on our faces. Will try one of the more adventurous seafood items next time!",
