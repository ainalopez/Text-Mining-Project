    "I like the location relative to the beach right on the board walk. I checked out another place before that was horrible and walked by carpe dime and saw it was busy. I also needed wifi and they had it when I decided to check it out and have a beer. It's one of those wifi systems that makes you login with Facebook and like them... That should have been the first red flag. The waiter and staff was very nice and attentive. I asked to be seated inside because it started getting cold as the sun set and decided I would try a dish and decide if I was going to fine with my drinks. I asked for a miso soup. They brought out a big bowl with noodles inside and it had a very fishy taste. I literally had three spoons and asked the waiter for the check. I told him I didn't care for the soup. He apologized and brought me the check which included the soup. I paid the check without a complaint.... At least they take Amex. I would have expected \"can recommend something else or we'll take it off your check\". Bottom line----it's a good place to have a drink---decent service obviously driven by bad management. The setting in nice next to the beach with the Asian theme consistent throughout.",
