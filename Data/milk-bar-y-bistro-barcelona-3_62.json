    "Myself and my boyfriend stopped by while we were in Barcelona over the weekend. Tasty food in a very relaxed atmosphere, we had the blueberry pancakes and the burger, and a mimosa and a Bloody Mary to start the morning off. Everything was lovely and no complaints. \u00a0The bill came to 30 euro which is pricey for breakfast and like others have mentioned it seemed more like a tourist spot than where the locals would be eating. Overall a good experience but nothing mind-blowing, and still a good option in a city that doesn't seem to be big on brunch.",
