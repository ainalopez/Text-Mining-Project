    "Great place for pinxos! Smaller tapas from the Basque region. I went to this place with 2 friends after reading about it on the GuidePal for Barcelona (great app). Immediately when you walk in you're impressed by the different number of pinxos available! They each cost around ~1.70 euros, and they offer dessert options as well! Pretty inexpensive for the quality of the food! I've had subpar pinxos that ran around 2-2.5 euros each. This place gets really crowded (it is touristy, I had english speakers on my left and right side) so try to go during an off hour, (before 2pm!!). It's self serve, each pincho has a kebob stick attached to it (even the hot ones that are on a small plate), you choose what you want onto a plate, and as you eat, a waiter/waitress will come by and take your sticks that you deposit into a jar. Also, I really recommend going with just a couple other people. You're basically hunting down for a spot to sit/stand in. They also have a downstars, which is a sit-down restaurant so I think they probably have a menu there. Don't know if you can bring the pinchos there (prb can..)",
