    "There is no menu. Gabriel comes up to you and asks what you like and you tell him whether you like fish, meat, etc. Then he recommends dishes based on your preferences. He is not only accommodating but easy on the eyes. You MUST try the egg dish as it is super delicious - the combination of the egg, fried potato crispies shrimp and pine nuts although it sounds unusual is a lovely dish. We had the razor clams which were amazing - simply prepared, grilled with a bit of olive oil and parsley. The super amazing thing which also really stands out is the desert of French toast with an incredibly smoky ice cream - so definitely save room for that. Even if you ONLY have that its lovely. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 - I only had two criticisms about the place. Again, this place is for the young. almost all of the seating was bar stools. Not comfortable for people over 40 and the tables that they did have were tiny and in corners - not enough room for me to sit comfortably. And the fact that the door was left open and the cigarette smoke wafted into the restaurant actually made it feel like people were smoking IN the restaurant. But the food is SO great its really worth dealing with all of that. one thing....we sat at the bar in front of the seafood so we got to see them discuss the fish and watch them prepare food. It was a good experience -- the men who work in this place are REALLY into the food... not so sure about the women.",
