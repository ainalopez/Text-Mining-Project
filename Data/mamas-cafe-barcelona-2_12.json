    "This place is absolutely adorable -- it's in a super safe location and everything is in English so it's very easy to order and speak to everyone! They're super accommodating and nice! Very reasonably priced and the food was stellar. Fantastic place for breakfast or brunch -- you can sit outside and be totally covered so it's perfect on a hot day! Will definitely be back!",
