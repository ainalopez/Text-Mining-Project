    "Came here tonight when La Fonda was too busy. It was very decent!!! We were pretty conservative in ordering as we just wanted a sure thing and weren't disappointed. Value was good. Happy with service and experience. Caesar- garlicky and lots of anchoviesEndive salad- looked like a pile of marshmallow with purple leaves sticking out of it but was surprisingly good. The white foam was some sort of cheese. Spaghetti with bolognese- good! A little sweet for my tastes but noodles were perfect. Beef carpaccio- tender and well flavoredDessert was gin and tonic in textures-??? That's what I said but it was creative and pleasant! Lemon sorbet on a jelly of gin with some foam. I didn't try the paella but wouldn't have high expectations for that there. Saw many various plates come by that looked good. Maybe I'll come back when I'm craving a burger or fried fish. Sure it's not your traditional... \"I'm inBarcelona and want every meal to be amazing and perfect\" type of meal but it had enough familiar with a touch of clever and yummy.Be careful though. Saw a man chasing after a pick pocket right after outside!!!",
