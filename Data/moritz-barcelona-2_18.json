    "What a fun place! It was crowded and had a great atmosphere on a Friday night! I'm a big fan of Moritz Epidor so I'm going to suggest you all drink that :) the food was delicious... ALWAYS GET BRAVAS!!! The \"bravas de alla\" are amazing! The tortilla espa\u00f1ola is also quite good, but if you don't get bravas you fail! The store is really cool too! Buy a liter of beer and you can come back to refill it for 4\u20ac... What. An. Amazing deal! I also took the time to shop around for souvenirs for people back home and they have something for everyone I'd say.Go to the bathroom! I don't care if you have to go or not just go... You can see the containers where they make the beer which is pretty cool and it's just cool to explore down there. It's a great atmosphere for young and old but the vibe is very local which is always good. When I go out I don't want to go out with tourists since I now consider myself a local ;)",
