    "Best meal in Barca. The bacalao was so fluffy and tasty and crispy on the outside. Best ever. Lamb brochettes were great with the mint yogurt. The pulpo with garbanzos was good. The fried asparagus was nice and light. So fresh. The waiter was a bit odd practising his english. The wine was good.",
