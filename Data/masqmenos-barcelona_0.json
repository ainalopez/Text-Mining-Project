    "Delicious tapas in small, intimate, yet modern upscale setting. \u00a0The flavors aren't anything innovative or mind-blowing but are yummy enough. \u00a0It's on the more expensive side, but my friend I enjoyed the bacalao and some sort of rucola and prosciutto dish. I'd say 3.5 for food. \u00a0Great location near las Ramblas gives it an additional 0.5 star.",
