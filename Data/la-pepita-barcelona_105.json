    "My very favorite tapas restaurant in Barcelona. We ate here twice in one week. The food is pricier than the other tapas places we ate at, but was done with a bit more finesse and style. The gin and tonics were fantastic and the sardine dishes were stellar. The service was excellent as well despite being super busy.",
