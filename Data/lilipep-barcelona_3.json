    "A lovely little cafe tucked away in the back streets. We had yummy tostadas con Serrano ham y tomate and were pleasantly surprised by it's very cheap price. \u00a310 for two of us for 4 coffees , food and a bottle of water. It reminded us a lot of cosy caf\u00e9s back in the UK with great artwork from local creatives, books and board games. Definitely going back for more! Great service too :)",
