    "Reeeediculoisly good. Recommended by our Fat Tire tour guide, Dicken (he was amazingly awesome on our bike tour, so of course we would wanted to take his advice), we had a phenomenal experience at Sensi. The pork dish, probably the best thing we've eaten in yearrrs. Wow well done. Everything we ate would get a 5 out of 5, but that pork dish was a 10 out of 5. \u00a0Thank you for this dinner to remember. P.s. All the servers were super cute (and yes my husband agreed), def a plus plus plus! Posted are all the delicious and recommended items to get. Thanks Dicken for the awesome recommendation!!",
