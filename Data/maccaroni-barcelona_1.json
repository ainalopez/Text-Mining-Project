    "A great find for authentic homemade Italian pastas perfectly located in El Born in Barcelona.The pastas are all fresh and homemade and you really can tell the difference. \u00a0The sauces are equally fresh and tasty.Very casual and tight seating. \u00a0Not a place to linger after you have finished. \u00a0You can get in and out fairly quickly (maybe 30 minutes).Great spot to bring kids - my 5 year old loved this place. \u00a0You can watch the chef making your food.Desserts and wines by the glass are also very good.They are definitely open for dinner until at least 22:30. \u00a0Not sure if they were open for lunch or late-night.",
