    "Authentic Italian pizza! Had the pizza with mushroom inside the crush and it was good (lacked a bit of flavor) but it was good anyway. One pizza is enough for 2 people but if you have a big appetite, go ahead and order more because you will not regret it. Also, the tiramisu is really yummy too. :) Would go back!!",
