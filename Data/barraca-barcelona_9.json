    "Definitely a locals place.We didn't have reservations and the host made us feel like he was doing us a favor by squeezing us in? You guys do know you're located in a tourist area right? Your restaurant was less that half full.The waitress was so nice, so helpful but her boss felt the need to override her. I noticed a couple times he was correcting her...she was doing a great job! Food wise: it is really good. We had the chicken croquettes which were awesome, a cioppino dish of some sort which was really good and the paella. Odd thing is that you have to order for 2 and it ain't cheap! I think it was around 30\u20ac each. Why don't they just put the full price and explain it's enough to share?Overall the food was great and our waitress...I just don't know how I felt about the host who happened to also be the one correcting our waitress. Completely awkward!",
