    "Great service. The servers always came to our table with a huge smile and were very patient as there were 8 of us... We got the larger platter to share (2 of them, it is usually for 3 ppl, but we did 4 to a plate, we could have ordered more good as it was delicious but with drinks and desert we left feeling perfecting full!) they gave us an extra beef portion to try free of charged and at the end the gave us a shot of liquor! Perfect ending to the night. The Ethiopian beers were fantastic, along with the teas! We will definitely be going back to this place!!!",
