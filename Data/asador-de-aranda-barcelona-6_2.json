    "As a tourist, I have to say this restaurant was fantastic! We were very surprised that as an organized tour lunch here was included in our tour package. \u00a0it's a beautiful restaurant.From start to finish, we thought the food was excellent. the highlight was the roast baby lamb. \u00a0I have never seen it on any restaurant menu that I've been to at home in the U.S. \u00a0It had golden brown crispy skin on top of succulent meat. there was no gamey lamb flavour here.Perhaps, there is better in Barcelona or other parts of Spain. I would go back here because I know it.Service was impeccable. one of our waiters even knew a little bit of English. a very accommodating establishment.",
