    "Myself and my Wife were staying on the same street as Tres Hermanos when we had a few days in Barca last year, so on the first night after a long walk up and down Las Ramblas we went in for some Tapas, and i have to say that it was really really nice especially the abondigas (feel free to shout at me if i spellded it wrong : ) ) To be honest i'm probably not the best person to review Tapas as i've only had it once or twice, but my Wife likes Tapas and she really enjoyed the food...when I go back to Barca,which I will I'll certainly go back to Tres Hermanos : ) I've noticed that it says about the attire (jacket) i dont know if this is true because neither I or anyone else in there was that formally dressed, i was wearing a t-shirt...... : )",
