    "Delicious food, very attentive service and great atmosphere! My fianc\u00e9 found this place while we were in Barcelona on vacation and the other Yelp reviews were spot on! We had tried all the typical tapas of Spain and wanted to try something different. There were really pretty red candles illuminating the alley leading up to the restaurant, so we decided to sit at a small table for two just outside, ordered drinks and 2 tapas: Cleopatra Bacon Dates and Halloumi with Chef's Pesto. Both were fantastic!! We'd never had Halloumi cheese before and it was incredible, with what tasted like a sun-dried tomato based pesto. Of course, the bacon-wrapped dates were a perfect balance of sweet and savory -- very big dates -- with like a balsamic vinegar drizzle.As for the service, it was the best we'd had in our almost 2 weeks in Spain. Waiters spoke English very well, there were menus in several languages and our waiter came by the table several times to check on us.I would definitely recommend Ziryab to anyone visiting Barcelona, especially if you're up for trying new and unique dishes.
