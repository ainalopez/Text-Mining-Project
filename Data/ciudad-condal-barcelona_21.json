    "It was ok, honestly the razor clams were overdone and didn't taste great and expensive compared to better dishes. And we didn't even order them, I just asked where they were on the menu and the next thing we knew they were there and they made us keep them. The potatoes with the egg and Bravas sauce was good but Luke warm. The cheese with nuts and jam was amazing though. Best dish of the night! We also had the eggplant and goat cheese dish which I liked but my friend didn't at all. Overall it was ok, 27 euros with no drinks and we weren't full and didn't like half of it.",
