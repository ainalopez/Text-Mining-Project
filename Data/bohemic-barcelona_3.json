    "I like to eat where it is about the good food and the true ambience, rather than about the designer glitz. So this is one of my very favorite places in BCN. Familiy business, in the true sense. Very cosy ambience, and VERY good food. Crossover between experimental and classic catalan cuisine. Not cheap, but far from expensive.",
