    "I have to say, I'm extremely picky with restaurants and their ambiance and Granja Petitbo nails it on the spot.Most importantly, the food is amazing. I've tried two \"menu del dia\"s and each time amazed. They use quality ingredients fresh from local sources. I'm not scared to venture throughout the menu because I haven't been disappointed thus far.As for the service, all the workers are pretty friendly (a change from the normal service staff in Spain). Very attentive and always greeted with a smile. Granja Petitbo is a little gem. I always love going there to grab a bite to eat or even just to work on my laptop with a nice cup of coffee. Get's pretty busy during lunch hours but other than that, a pretty laxed vibe. Cute decor too.",
