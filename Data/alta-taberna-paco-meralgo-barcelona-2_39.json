    "A very memorable meal in Barcelona that I enjoyed probably more than the traditional tapas places we also ventured to.Seemed like there were more locals than tourists here (yey!) Highlights:1) Fried spring onions with romesco sauce - simple but delicious. 2) Grilled shrimp- okay I know they serve this everywhere else in Spain but it tasted the most fresh here compared to the other places we visited. And the shrimp had their heads on!!! Oh Spain, I love you. You just..get it.3) Cava Sangria - first time I had it with cava and there is no going back4) *bonus* Pan in pan amb tomaquet was heated - yes I'm shallow but I believe this staple with the bread more warm tastes better.",
