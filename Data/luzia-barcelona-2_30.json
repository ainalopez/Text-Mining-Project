    "We ate here twice on our trip to Barcelona and it is muy fabulosa - everything was delicious but we especially loved the cocktails, shrimp, and tuna tartare. \u00a0So good we may even go back a third time, if you're on La Rambla then definitely stop by. \u00a0The cocktails were ~6 euro and the tapas were ~10 euro...",
