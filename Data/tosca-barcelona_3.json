    "Quaint little restaurant with so many good dishes!! Great way to our Barcelona trip! I'd come back again next time!The food:Jamon Iberica: very generous portion!! Tasty and delicious!Foie gras and cheese plate: very smooth foie gras and yummy Brie. Nothing too extraordinary but comfort food for those who love foie gras and Brie.Mussels: they cook theirs with a green/herb/garlicky sauce. It was finger licking good!! We dipped bread into the sauce! :-)Fried baby octopus: MUST GET! Freshly fried so it's hot and cooked perfectly! Not rubbery, not smelly, not greasy. So good!Sangria: light, flavorful, refreshing on a warm summer's night!",
