    "Inside the La Boqueria Mercat, you will find this small tapas bar with delicious food. \u00a0It is pretty basic and simple to what they serve. \u00a0I loved the fresh grilled shrimp and chick peas. \u00a0For breakfast, make sure you try the Xuxo. \u00a0It is this custard filled pastry that is deep fried and coated with sugar. \u00a0Make sure to get here early to try it because it sells out. \u00a0Service could be better, but they are pretty quick. \u00a0Just have to fight for a spot at the bar with limited seating. \u00a0Always busy. \u00a0Breakfast and lunch. \u00a0They do have a few tables with table service if you have a bigger group. \u00a0We met nice Spaniards here eating alone and guided us through the menu basically. \u00a0It was a fun experience.",
