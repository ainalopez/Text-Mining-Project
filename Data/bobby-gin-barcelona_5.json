    "Reminds me of trendy restaurants in NY. In Spain, personally I would rather go to traditional restaurants, but if you need to escape that, this a cool place to hang out.Seating can make it hard to eat and is more like a lounge setting. The Tokio Blue was delicious (10 EUR).Food portions were small but creative. Nothing especially amazing, but nothing was bad:-Bravas 6.80-Croquetas 6.60-Langostinos 7.90-Cracker foie 7.50-Ceviche 9.50-Tuna tataki 12.00-Arepitas 6.50",
