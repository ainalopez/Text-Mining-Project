    "Wonderful fresh... No need for lots of added sauces or seasonings- this place celebrates the deliciousness of fresh, well grilled food. The baby squid were the best I've ever had and the plate of grilled veggies was huge!!I loved them so much I asked for a 'cuadro' to take away the rest to eat for breakfast. Kind, helpful staff and quick service!!",
