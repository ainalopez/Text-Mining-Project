    "This place is very popular and for a good reason. The food is just amazing. Everyone that works there speaks English and is very helpful and forgiving to tourists that are in need of direction. \u00a0The bull tail risotto was my favorite dish along with everything foie gras. A must if you are in Barcelona.",
