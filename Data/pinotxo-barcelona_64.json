    "Bar Pinoxto is located in the Boqueria Mercat (fresh seafood/farmers market/local candy stands), it is bar style seating with the kitchen directly in front of you. I had the langostinos (lobster without claws) and 3 gambas (shrimp). All seafood is still fresh and moving right before being cooked. The lobster, and shrimp were prepared on a griddle. The lobster was split in half with olive oil drizzled with sprinkle of coarse kosher salt thrown on top. The lobster meat was sooo sweet and the juices from the shrimp heads were spectacularly succulent, especially with fresh bread dipped into it. Took a picture with the owner, was an eccentric fellow, but very friendly!Note: Barcelona is proud of their Catalan heritage and often times speak it, government signs and many private business signs are in Catalan as opposed to traditional Spanish, which may make it harder for folks to navigate. Also beware the conversion factor this meal cost me 90 Euro.",
