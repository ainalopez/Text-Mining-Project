    "This place is amazing. I spent five days in Barcelona and every night started out with drinks at Creps al Born. The bartenders are true mixologist and really put their heart into the drinks they are making. Every drinks is specifically crafts and has ingredients once would never think would taste good in a drink such as bell peppers, BBQ sauce and heavy milk. The establishment is full of locals that seem to be known by the bar staff. During our visit, the bar was announced the best bar in Spain. It's off the tourist path, but well worth finding. Very small space, so get there early if you have a crowd.",
