    "On our first night in Barcelona, we walked over there but they were closed. It was the last day of their holiday (yes, be careful of restaurant schedules there. They take one-month long vacations in the summer and their restaurant would be shut altogether.) The second night, we tried again and boy was it worth it. My husband and I ordered many many tapas and enjoyed most of them. \u00a0This is mostly Pintxo style which means they pile up stuff on top of bread and stick a tooth pick in to hold them together. \u00a0You save your tooth picks and once you're done, the bartender will count them and calculates your bill.",
