    "Possibly the best paella. \u00a0Old school service, attention and decor. Pricey...but highly recommended if you are splurging on a one time expensive restaurant in the city. \u00a0Reservations or early arrival also recommended. \u00a0All the secondary dishes are expensive but a meal unto themselves. Bring hunger. \u00a0The wine they recommended we'll be on our list for permanent purchase .",
