    "Good food, TERRIBLE service.The food wasn't exceptional, but it was quite delicious and filling. Albeit a bit pricey, not a complete rip-off either. (We spent 60euros for two people)The service, on the other hand, was embarrassing.We were seated next to the podium where the waiters plated the dishes. We saw something of interest, and asked TWO waiters. The first said \"lobster and calamari\", even though the dish didn't look like it had either. We looked for it on the menu, and couldn't find it. So we asked another waiter to help us point it out. She didn't even turn her head and said \"Something in the seafood section.\"Keep in mind, we spoke fluent Spanish. So this wasn't your typical case of rudeness toward foreigners.Seriously? For a business of this price range I expect MUCH better service. Our main waiter also did the bare minimum. Take our order and leave. No smiles, no greetings. I asked him for a recommendation for something with vegetables, wasn't too heavy, and was regional. I received a dish that had barely any vegetables, and was quite heavy. Really?Server was equally distant and almost rude. Shoving plates in front of us and nudging glasses aside. No hello, no smile. He almost looked like he was in pain serving us. Nobody asked us if our food was okay. Nobody asked us if we would like anything else. The only thing they were eager and attentive about was hovering impatiently while we paid the bill.They also charged for the bread with out telling us it's not complimentary. This behavior is something I expect from smaller restaurants in Barcelona, but not a place so well-known and \"classy.\" Not to mention the bread was stale.Terrible, terrible, terrible. We left in a horrible mood.",
