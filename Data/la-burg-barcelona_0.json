    "I love La Burg for the simple fact that they make delicious gourmet-style burgers and they don't even brag about it. This is the second best restaurant in Barcelona for burgers, no doubts. I have tried so many burger restaurants around the world and they all claim to make delicous best burgers but as usual they end up being tasteless or simply mediocre because of the ingredients they use.La Burg is not worried \"about bigger\" is better or \"more ingredients\" means is better...the just make simple tasty burgers and it works.Highly recommend La New York or the one with Cafe Par\u00eds sauce.",
