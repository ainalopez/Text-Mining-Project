    "as an avid traveller I can safely say this is the best Ramen I've ever had , granted I've not been to Japan. I was in Barcelona for 7 days and had to eat \u00a0here 3 times , turning my back on some of my favourite eateries that I like to visit when in the city. The guys running the place were super friendly and my compliments to the chef , Ill \u00a0most definitly be back",
