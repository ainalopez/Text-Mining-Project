    "As fellow Yelper's attest, Fabian was Surprisingly expensive and served small portions. The pizza looked good, though we decided to share an order of their \"bruschetta tartar\"...but at 12\u20ac, it was not a good value, even though the flavor was nice but too heavy on the balsamic. This is a short review...you can get better pizza in the area.",
