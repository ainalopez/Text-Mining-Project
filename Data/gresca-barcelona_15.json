    "The mix of textures, flavors, and technique the chef used here were commendable. He really took the beautiful seafood and did it justice. Of course, the egg souffle was sublime, but the pigeon was an incredible close second. Each course made sense in terms of the order of when it came out. The dining room is a bit small, but it's intimate.",
