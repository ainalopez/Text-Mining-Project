    "Came here with my boyfriend for dinner. If the weather is nice definitely choose to sit outside. The wait is very minimal. The prawn skewers as suggested by everyone else was so good. We also got the beef tapa which came on a piece of bread with a hot pepper. It was not too shabby. The sangria here is decently strong and delicious! We also got the calamari (excellent), bravas (you can never go wrong with bravas), fried hot pepper (good but may be a little bland) as well as cuttle fish (so so good!). The service was attentive and quick enough and the food as well as people watching was spot on.",
