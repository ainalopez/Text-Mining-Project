    "Definitely trendy -- a colorful menu that seems straight out of a chain or franchise; the building has been renovated in an urban chic style that exposes the unadorned brick of the original walls. \u00a0The food is excellent and varied. \u00a0We had Coraz\u00f3n Parti\u00f3, the Aubergine Cake and the Aubergine Millefeuille, all of which were excellent. \u00a0The service was also very professional, and very accommodating of my limited Spanish, switching to English when necessary.",
