    "This Japanese restaurant is very close to Plaza Catalunya in small side street, but nonetheless largely untouched by tourists. This might be the case because it does not look like much, neither from the outside nor the inside. However, the place is always crowded and not that big, so it might be difficult to find a table. But since the service is very fast and people do no stay there very long, you might consider waiting for tables to free up. The food is very good as is the service (which actually is Japanese) and they have more than just sushi on offer. The prices are just below average for Sushi in my opinion. So definitely recommended if you just want to cater to your sushi cravings with not more than four friends and don't want to sit in the restaurant all evening.",
