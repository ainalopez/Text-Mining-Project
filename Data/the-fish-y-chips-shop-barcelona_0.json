    "We hit this restaurant during a slow moment. Got right in. The food was delicious. Simple. Old school fish and chips, with some Catalan appetizers and tapas to round out the menu. Not a fancy place. Casual. Friendly. They have an ample beer menu. This was my favorite meal in all of Barcelona. If I ever go back to Barcelona, this will be a first stop",
