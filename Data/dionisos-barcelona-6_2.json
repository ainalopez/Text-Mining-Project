    "Very nice Greek food at very good prices. \u00a0If you order from the 15 Euro menu, you get nice portions of food, wine and dessert - and leave more than satisfied. \u00a0You also get a nice variety of dishes to pick from on the prix fixe menu. \u00a0The regular menu had a lot more variety, and pricier options - but all seemed fair. \u00a0I started with the spanakopita, and had the baked orzo pasta dish as the main course. \u00a0For dessert, I went with the Baklava only because my friends had never had it from Dionisos, and my real first choice of the semolina cake was already being ordered. \u00a0The spanakopita was excellent. \u00a0The pasta dish was ok. \u00a0But really - that semolina cake was my favorite. \u00a0Not to say the baklava wasn't good - because it was... but next time I'll get the semolina even if someone else is already getting it. \u00a0Service was friendly, gracious and quick! \u00a0(when do I ever say that about service in BCN?).",
