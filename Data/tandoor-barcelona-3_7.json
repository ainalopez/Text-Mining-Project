    "Excellent Indian food in this Hindu restaurant in the heart of Barcelona. This place must be very original, at least we were facing roughly 20 Indian-looking persons and felt almost alienated by this fact. However, the service immediately gave us a warm welcome and made us feel comfortable. The food is very good and they have everything on offer that should not be missing in an Indian restaurant. They even served the mouth fresheners after dinner. I like. The only downside to this restaurant is the atmosphere in the restaurant. Regrettably this place looks a bit sad and has no windows. Therefore on star less as the food would definitely deserve 5.",
