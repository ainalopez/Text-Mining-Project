    "This place is happening! Earlier reviews said we would be hard pressed to get service without the right language but we did OK at the bar! \u00a0Highly recommend going earlier than later bc it gets pretty crazy in there.We got sangria and it was great. Only 15\u20ac for 1L.Great food. Ask the staff for their recommendations if the menu seems overwhelming.",
