    "Cafe Granja Viader a very locals place and does take a bit of an effort to find it. It's been in business since 1870 and this family boasts of being the first dairy business to bottle and distribute milk in Spain. Gayle and I found this old and cozy place via the Rick Steves' Tour Book. We both really enjoyed the rich drinking chocolate and with churros for dipping. The coffee (solo for me and con leche for Gayle) were tasty, as were the muffins and croissants.",
