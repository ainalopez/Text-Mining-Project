    "After much research and internal and external debate, \u00a0I settled on this place for my quintessential Barcelona paella experience. 5 stars on yelp, close to my apartment, and family owned all added up to amazing paella, right? Well, maybe. I think the paella was authentic and probably a good representation of the dish. Maybe I'm just not a paella person? It wasn't all that exciting, but I only had the rice and chicken parts. My friend devoured the seafood components so perhaps for shellfish folk it's more of a payoff. I thoroughly enjoyed the tapas of little red peppers filled with tuna ( sadly you only get four and they disappear much too fast) as well as the anchovies. The sangria was decent. The low point was prob the service. I wanted to ask the waitress about the legendary scrolls and background of the restaurant, but despite the fact we were the only ones in the place, she was pretty curt and abrupt. Overall, a bit pricey for what turned out to be an okay meal. Take note, the restaurant didn't open until 7:45, despite the sign on the door saying it opens at 7:15.",
