    "It seems to be a new restaurant in Barcelona with some problems. Nearly everybody of the staff cannot speak English and it took one hour from ordering to deliver the food to our tables. The dishes (we had fish) were tasty but other guests beside us had a lot of complaints because they were getting a steak with fries and no salt, pepper or ketchup. They wanted salt for the fries but the staff did not understand them. They had some live music but this did not helped when waiting one hour for the food. I would not recommend this place unless you have too much time or can speak Catalan or Spanish.",
