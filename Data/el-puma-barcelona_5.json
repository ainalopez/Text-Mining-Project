    "El Puma would have earned 4 stars from us if the service had been as good as the food. \u00a0For buffet food, it was really quite good and predominantly fresh. \u00a0The service, on the other hand, was horrific. \u00a0Our server clearly wanted to be somewhere else and did not want to be bothered by us and was very irritated that we spoke English.We paid $20 euro for the buffet and $3 euro for water...very reasonable for the quality of the food. \u00a0But, wow, the service really was bad.",
