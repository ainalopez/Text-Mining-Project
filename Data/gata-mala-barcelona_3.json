    "Truly awesome experience! Food is prepared with love. Great ambience. The owner and staff are super friendly. If you are looking for a \"button-down, let-loose\" kind of place where you can relax from the stuffiness and politics of office work, you have to try this place at least once. Tapas are served with your drink order. And they are incredibly flavourful on their own. The eggplant and goat cheese plate is delectable. The Patatas Bravas are simple and rustic, yet full of flavour. The steak was mouth-watering, accompanied with mashed potatoes and pimientos and then pan seared. The dessert was divine, lavished in chocolate with hints of orange and sprinkled with coconut flakes. My first time here was great! Make it yours too!",
