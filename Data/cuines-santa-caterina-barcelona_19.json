    "Spacious, cool vibe with an international themed menu. The menu is divided according to the protein (or vegetarian option) and type of cuisine (Mediterranean, Asian and something else). We had a variety of dishes and was pleased with their interpretation of each cuisine. It's definitely not authentic, but the food had great flavor. I especially enjoyed their version of stir fry. The ingredients were fresh, healthy and each dish was well-executed. Also, beware that their is a service charge of 1\u20ac per person, listed as a charge for bread. We were not made aware of this and did not want the bread in the first place.The ambience and diverse menu offerings make me a fan of this establishment.",
