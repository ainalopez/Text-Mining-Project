    "The restaurant was off the main road but the outside seating area was pleasant. The food was very tasty; the spices in the rice were really nice accompanied with the chicken vindaloo I ordered. Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive and made sure we were having a great dining experience and gave us complimentary mango lassis at the end of our meal. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for authentic Indian food.",
