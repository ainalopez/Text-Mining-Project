    "My friend and I ate here for dinner a few weeks back: Patatas bravas with spicy mayo, Catalan Ham, a mix of the best olives I've ever had, a great salmon with bok choy and finally (2) slices of bread with brie and tomato jam. We enjoyed absolutely everything including a jug of red Sangria! Service was good, all the servers spoke english and were helpful. Atmosphere was nice and cozy, we felt no rush to leave after our great meal.",
