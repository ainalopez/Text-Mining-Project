    "Don't know what I can say that already hasn't been said --- this is a great little establishment that slings excellent tasty cava and Bocadillos at a very reasonable price. \u00a0The cava definitely packs a punch and I got buzzed off two of them. \u00a0It's a little bit on the sweeter side --- tried both the red and white. \u00a0The sandwiches (Bocadillos) are a must just to avoid getting totally wasted. \u00a0I had two: \u00a0the foie with cheese (foie con fromage) and the chicken with pepper (pollo con pimiento). \u00a0The foie is definitely a pate of the canned variety --- it's not the luxurious kind and honestly I enjoyed the chicken and pepper as a result (more fresh, more flavor). \u00a0I also tried their fried croquettes: just think of any other fried bar bite --- solid but not mind blowing.All in all this is a must try just to enjoy the cava and it won't break the bank. \u00a0Be sure to bring cash and be ready to stand as there are no tables or chairs and limited bar space.",
