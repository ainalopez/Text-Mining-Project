    "This is a great place. A perfect chocolate place in the middle of Barcelona. It's in a lovely neighborhood. It's a nice atmosphere, and they have board games and the like for little kids. My one\\ complaint is that it is incredibly loud, and small, so you never really feel like you have your own space. If they fixed that, then it is definitely worth 5 stars, because otherwise, all the food, everything I've tried here has been really good.",
