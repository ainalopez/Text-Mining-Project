    "Super friendly staff, who is solidly bilingual, but I'm sorry, Yelp has massively overrated this pedestrian pasta place. I've had the best handmade, Argentinian pasta and this isn't even close. Good handmade ravioli melts in your mouth, this isn't that good. Hardly.My 4 cheese ravioli carbonara were bland and it took two plates to yield one edible dish. The first plate was al dente and cold - a horrid combination - while my spouse's spaghetti bolognese was piping hot, literally steaming. I had a spinach empanada and it was tiny, of average quality for such things. The remake came out much warmer, but still a little short of what I'd like in a pasta dish, but I was starving and ate as much of it as I could.... Which is the worst review of food I can give. An unfinished plate. I did not finish. The tiramisu was alright, not much to write home about. The ambience was kitschy, with every five feet a different ceiling height. The bathroom was laughable, with three different steps and ceilings - but clean enough and with soap and a hand dryer.Again, all of the service was friendly, and they really tried hard and smiled a lot. But if you're in Barcelona, only go if you are desperate for some red sauce, and focused on rock bottom prices over quality, they'll smile a lot and try their best.",
