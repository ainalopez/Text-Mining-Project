    "We decided to go here after seeing reviews on yelp. We had a great Catolonian experience - sangria, beers and tapas. Nice food, good experience and very friendly \u00a0service. We sat out the back which was a nice surprise from first seeing the front. The price was very reasonable considering the experience.",
