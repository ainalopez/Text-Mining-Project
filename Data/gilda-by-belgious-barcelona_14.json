    "We made a reservation there because they had very high ranking on trip advisor and that's what most reviewers were recommending, but that was not necessary. There were plenty of spaces and we were seated very promptly. Food was not bad, but definitely nothing to write home about.The steak was very bland, but the stew was very good. Decent appetizers and quality sangria. Very good service and nice and romantic place inside. Overall - I'd recommend it, but I'd suggest opting out of steaks. Dinner for two with drinks was 50 euro - reasonable for the area. It's right in the heart of the old city.",
