    "So we have eaten in many places in Barcelona including some places recommended by locals and this place just blew everyone else out of the water. Spinach Pesto Ravioli and Vegetable Lasagna were just phenomenal! Plus we paid \u20ac22 for 2 people for dinner! Each Entree includes bread, a drink and desert. You will not find better food for a cheaper price. Just go already. You will not regret it!",
