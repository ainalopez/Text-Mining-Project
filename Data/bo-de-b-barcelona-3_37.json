    "In a city where you're constantly figuring out how to scrape together a few Euro to buy some delicious lifewater (known by some to be Sangria, but whatever, tomato tomahto, you know?) any way to get delicious food at a reasonable price is always welcome.This little upscaled version of Subway is just that and then some. My guess as to what makes the subs so delicious are the meat seasonings. I don't know what they do, but what seems like a simple sub always ends up extra tasty and delicious, and better than what my expectations thought they were.Here's what you can expect in a nutshell: Delicious, fresh chicken or beef, fresh veggie toppings, perfectly toasted bread, a number of sauces to choose from, a line :(, and very reasonable prices (around 4-5 euro).Great place for weary travelers and locals alike. Hit up the Gothic Quarter for this great sub stop.",
