    "We spent the Xmas in beautiful Barcelona and got the recomandation from the wonderful staff at the Tryp Apolo Hotel to eat here. We are from Norway and for the Xmas night (24th December) are we always having cod. We arrived at L'Amfora and was immediately guided to a very cozy table. The restaurant is really genuin and you feel the Catalanian history in the wall of this restaurant. We had snails as a starter and it blew our expectations by far. The natural nutty flavours of the snail and sauce really was a treat for us. As main we choose to different fish dishes. My wife selected Monkfish and I had cod with garlic sause. Everything tasted really wonderful and the suggested wine was an excelent complimentary to these wonderful dishes we were served. Really nice restaurant with a genuine feeling to it.",
