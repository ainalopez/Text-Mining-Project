    "I went her with a friend and everything started off good. We had a few good tapas but then we got a Salmon ceviche that was room temperate. Out last so dishes were forgettable so I can't recall what they were. Big of us left very disappointed. Maybe it's cuz we had such amazing meals in Barcelona thus far, or maybe it was just because the food was average at best. Cava wine was good and service was great too, but can't make up for bad food.",
