    "This tiny hole-in-the-wall tapas bar in the Barceloneta neighborhood of Barcelona was totally full of locals-only and it seemed as we were the only tourists in the whole restaurant ... totally the type of place I love!4 or 5 tapas later this place had the BEST spicy sauce, in combination with homemade mayo \u00a0( get their Bombas ), and very flavorful artichokes, a friendly waiter, a great vibe and a huge line out the door of people waiting for our tableA big list of daily specials, a longer list on a menu and some good selections amongst it all make this place a must stop-by if you are in the neighborhood.Add it to your tapas-tour list when you're in Barcelona and you won't be disappointed.I'm torn writing this first english review of this place as I don't want to change the locals-only feel to it but hopefully not the whole world reads this. \u00a0:-)",
