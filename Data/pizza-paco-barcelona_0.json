    "In a nice, relaxed square just behind the beaten track one may chance upon Pizza Paco. If you do, do sit down and have a pizza there!The pizzas are big and tasty and accompanied by a glass of tinto de verano, the pizza slices go down as easily as it is to relax and enjoy sitting among locals, not throngs of other tourists. The waitress was very nice and friendly and if I am to complain about something, it is the fact that it took a while before our food came. However, with a beer in my hand and a happy girlfriend right next to me, I'm not really sure the wait mattered that much.",
