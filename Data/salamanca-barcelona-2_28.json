    "The paella rocked. Absolutely lovely. I, who usually skip white rice scarfed down every morsel. The waiter was charming, fun, and helped create a party atmosphere. At the end, he brought complimentary apple liqueur and olive oil cake. We used Yelp to look for it, and it was well worth the time to search it out.(Two weeks later)I was too much in a hurry on my vacation to add more detail, but I should have mentioned we sat out on a huge terrace shared by several restaurants at the edge of the Mediterranean Sea. The traditional sangrias were refreshing and well-chilled, not too strong for a warm evening. We didn't realize how extraordinary they were until we sampled those of other restaurants over the next few days. Some, like in The Three Bears story, were too strong, some too weak, most not iced enough. Salamanca's were just right.",
