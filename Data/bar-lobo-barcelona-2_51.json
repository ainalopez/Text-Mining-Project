    "Stumbled upon this place last night. Wonderful light meal, which is just what we needed, but the full menu is very interesting. If i had more time, im sure we would go back for a paella as it looked delicious! Excellent value and good service. If you are there early enough and seats are available, I suggest sitting outside.",
