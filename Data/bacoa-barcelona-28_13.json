    "This place is guaranteed to have a line out the door around dinner time, and a consistent flow of customers throughout the day. Given how busy this cozy sized bar is, I was surprised at not only how quick the service was after ordering, but also at the quality of the food that from a simple menu. The food is tasty, the service is good, and you definitely get what you paid for.",
