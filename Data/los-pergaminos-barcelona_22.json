    "If you are into seafood paella then you gotta go here. It was out of this world good! The service was really friendly (we didn't speak Catalan but the waiter spoke decent English) and gave us a great recommendation on red wine that wasn't on the menu. Great location in the El Born/Gothic neighborhood. I would highly recommend trying this place out if you are in the neighborhood or in Barcelona in general.",
