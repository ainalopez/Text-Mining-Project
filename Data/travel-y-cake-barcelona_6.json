    "Been here a few times and I feel it is missing the mark of what it is going for. Of its sister/brother places of Brunch & Cake as well as Cup & Cake, I feel this is the one that struggles the most as it starts to feel slowly more like a chain location, rather than a unique experience. Coffee is decent. I would recommend going outside the traditional brunch menu and focusing more on the lunch items, which I have found to be better. I've really enjoyed the super sandwich de pollo. The challenge is what to compare it too? To other places in Barcelona, it might get a 4. To those used to getting high quality brunch in London, NYC or Melbourne (Australia for those who don't know where that is), it would get a 2. The service, especially, is not too bad by local (non-tourist zone) standards.",
