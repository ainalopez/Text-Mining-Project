    "When we arrived, the hostess sent us to the next door bar to wait for a table. We waited for about 20 min in the bar. \u00a0The wait was worth it!! I tried five different tapas and all of them were really good. \u00a0The service and ambiance were great too! Too bad I discovered this place on my last day in Barcelona.",
