    "Ideal for a quick bite and some mediocre wine. The tapas were very good. The fried smelt, anchovies, bread and tomato, and bread and chorizo and of course olives were all delicious \u00a0It seemed like a one man show. The place definitely gets a lot of press with the yelp stickers, timeout magazine posts, etc which unfortunately has probably driven up prices.",
