    "After spending 7 days in Barcelona, Els Sortidors became my fast favorite. Other places were wonderful too - we ventured all over the city and experienced everything from cheap tapas to fine dining. But, Els Sortidors was outstanding. The food is dreamy. Everything is so fresh & beyond delicious. The house made Vermouth is perfection - (Tip: you can get a container to go. It made it all the way home in our checked luggage.). The tomato bread was crispy and savory. The mussels were outstanding. The wine was wonderful, especially for the price. The anchovies were full of flavor. Everything we tried was better than expected.The atmosphere is relaxing & charming. You can sit on stools around barrels and people watch - or you can also dine at a table or spot at the bar top.The staff went above and beyond to work with us - as we willingly struggled to speak catalan when possible. All in all - this is the only establishment that we visited multiple times. We wanted to explore - try as many restaurants as possible - but, when it came down to it - we caved and went back to 'our spot' 3-4 times. It was just too good.",
