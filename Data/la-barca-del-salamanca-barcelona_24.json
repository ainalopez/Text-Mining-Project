    "Very nice restaurant, famous for it's fish but also if you order meat. Incredible fast service, friendly but you should know what you want and have a strong mind \u00a0if you don't the waiters will fool you and talk you into most expensive stuff. Had a local guy with me, so that's been avoided and food was as good. Will go there again \u00a0with locals or with a list what to order and what not to.",
