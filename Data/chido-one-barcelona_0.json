    "As my Mexican friend said after we finished dinner here, \"This meal made me very happy.\"The food here is Southern Mexican fare. \u00a0The flautas, huaraches and tres leches were all fantastic. \u00a0The margerita and mezcalerita were a bit on the weak side for our taste but still well made. \u00a0Music and decor were enjoyable and fitting for the setting.Definitely recommend for anyone looking for Mexican or for a break from all the tapas!",
