    "This trendy, inexpensive bar has funky music, plenty of comfortable seating, and a welcoming vibe. They offer tapas and entrees for cheap prices, and we found pitchers of good sangria that served four people, for less than 12 euros.The upstairs lounge area was great for a group of us, with tables centered around benches and pillows. There's also a bar area downstairs, if you're just stopping in for a cheap, quick drink. The staff was extremely friendly, and we never felt rushed to leave. The atmosphere is definitely multi-cultural, with both staff and visitors speaking multiple languages in the same room.",
