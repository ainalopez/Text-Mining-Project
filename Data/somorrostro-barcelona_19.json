    "This Barceloneta spot is tucked away and superb! It's right by a city square that is worth a stroll around as well. In this area, it's easy to get pulled into a tourist trap along the main street to the beach. However, at this restaurant the mantra is \"local and fresh\". The gazpacho here was my favorite in the city. Grab the oysters if you can!",
