    "This place is awesome. I was walking around plaza espanya & found this place. It was after 3 & though everything is done later in Barcelona, a decent crowd in the place is usually a good indication that It's good. Prices are reasonable. I ordered the ultimate seafood platter; freakin' amazing & for only 20e it was a heck of a deal. Experience makes me want to move to Barcelona, true story. Go here if you're in the area",
