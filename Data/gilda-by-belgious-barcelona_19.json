    "Cool ambience and priced right. Good drinks but I found the food to be average. It wasn't bad just not delicious. Nothing to complain about but nothing to get excited about either. \u00a0The mussels were good as was the chicken curry(although a little bland). The fried cheese and onions was well done and my wife's salad was a generous portion. Sometimes trendy places mask mundane food.",
