    "I don't even know where to start. Everything we ordered here was delicious. My favorite was the foie gras balls and these two dishes.. I can't remember what it was and my phone ran out of battery. Used my boyfriend's phone. It was like a black squid ink paella w an egg-- to die for. The other dish was so amazing we picked thru it before we took a pic. This place is to die for. Will go back to Barcelona just to eat there!!",
