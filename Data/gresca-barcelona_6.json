    "I can't say enough good things about this place. It is by far the best meal and dining experience my husband and I have had in BCN, and we spend a lot of time here for work. The service is amazing, they are super nice, and very helpful. We ordered the egg souffl\u00e9 = Amazing! A must try. We also had a lamb special, it was a large, to share dish served with mashed potatoes. It was so well prepared and cooked, probably one of the best lamb dishes I have had at any restaurant. For dessert we had the smoke Ice Cream and the chocolate with olive oil. Don't let the names scare you, I only wish I had the words to explain how good these are. My mouth waters just thinking about them now! Anyhow, overall this is by far one of the best restaurants out there. Every single part of our meal was fantastic. I am already planning to go back before our trip is over, maybe try the stake or the fish.",
