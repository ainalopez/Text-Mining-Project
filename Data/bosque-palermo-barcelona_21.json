    "Yelped the place looking for a good paella while in Barcelona, just left Madrid and found great spot there on Yelp. I disregarded bad reviews because most said the paella was pretty good. Big mistake, the service is terrible, I couldn't wait to pay my bill and leave. Once again the paella was pretty good, but if service isn't an issue be my guest. For the other items, the Sangria was ok, I haven't tasted to many sangria that was bad. It's a very easy drink to make, most restaurants can make it with there eyes closed. Lastly my wife had the cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e, she said it was pretty good as well. (I didn't taste it, as I said early I was ready to get the hell out of there) you've been warned about the service, take heed. I wish I did. To many great restaurants in Barcelona to deal with one with terrible service.",
