    "Loved this place so much we came back again! Delicious pintxos for just 1 euro each, the best price and deal in the area. They also have cheap and wonderful sangria. I'd recommend just about every pintxo, although I was definitely partial to the ones with salmon, fresh cheese, and ham. Nice little desserts too, like cream puffs in chocolate sauce, still for 1 euro each. Definitely recommended!",
