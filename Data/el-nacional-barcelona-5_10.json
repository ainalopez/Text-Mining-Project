    "This place is very cool, its a large old school market that's split into several upscale restaurants (fish, meats, tapas, veggies) and specialty bars (cocktails, oysters, wine, beer) Reminds me of a much more civilized version \u00a0of Eataly or a upscale version of Gansevoort Market We went to the tapas bar (similar to most good spots in Barcelona, it will begin to get packed at around 8pm until late). \u00a0The tapas are priced ~5-10 euros. We got the pot of mussels (very fresh!), patatas bravas, chorizo in cider sauce (I didn't eat these, but the sauce tasted great), calamari and a couple of glasses of wine. Everything was served quickly and was fresh and tasted great. From the desserts I recommend crema catalana and the pionono (small, but very tasty - you don't really need a bigger serving) The whole establishment is very beautiful and I recommend walking around a bit before sitting down at the restaurant of your choosing",
