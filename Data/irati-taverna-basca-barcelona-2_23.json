    "So the Tapas were good here. \u00a0We tried a bunch of toothpick tapas places while we were in Spain, and this was near the top on quality food for the price. \u00a0But the service was a bit lacking. \u00a0What a love about Spain is that the food is awesome + the service is usually also very very good. \u00a0They were not bad, but I don't think they were going out of there way to be friendly. \u00a0And that might sound a bit spoiled, but hey - I got a lot of good service in Spain.",
