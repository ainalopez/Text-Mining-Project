    "After gorging myself with meat tapas all week I figured a little salad wouldn't hurt...Fantastic vegetarian restaurant here. Everything is remarkably fresh and there's no trace of hippy culture like you usually come across in all veggie places. You would never know its a vegetarian restaurant without looking at the menu.",
