    "This place has a really long queue and is supposed to be an institution. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things, but I wasn't entirely impressed with this place especially given the mindblowing food I had at other places, but it wasn't too bad either. We looked around to see what everyone had ordered and got a croissant and churros, as well as the hot chocolate and Cacaolat which this place supposedly invented. The hot chocolate wasn't as thick as I would have liked, and the Cacaolat was pretty nice though I'm not sure what the hype is about. Everything is served with a lot of whipped cream, and in fact they even sell whipped cream on it's own. Perhaps they're known for their whipped cream too? I'm not sure. The rest of the desserts on display looked really good though, so perhaps those might have been a better choice.",
