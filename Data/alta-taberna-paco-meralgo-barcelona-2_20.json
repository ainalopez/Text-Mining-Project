    "My go-to dinner restaurant in Barcelona. I literally am out of breath just thinking about how wonderful this place is. Simple, fresh, delicious ingredients. Attentive service. A true gem of Barcelona. Highly recommend the razor clams, the courgette flowers, the bombas, the bravas, the pan con tomate, the asparagus, any of the montaditos, and the garlic steak. Pretty much everything I would recommend (except the rabbit cutlets, wasn't a fan of those). Order several tapas and a ca\u00f1a or a glass of wine, and settle down for one of those beautiful, lingering meals that Europe is known for. I can't wait to return to this restaurant the next time I'm in BCN.",
