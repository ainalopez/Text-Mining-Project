    "Don't be shy - just get up in there and start pointing to shit and ordering! The owner is awesome and runs a right ship - awesome food from cheeses, to meats, to drinks! Great pricing is what really keeps this local spot visited by expats legit! Not for yuppies looking for a table to be seen",
