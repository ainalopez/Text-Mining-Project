    "This place is a hidden gem in Barcelona!! It's close to the Paral-lel station, on 17 Calle Blai, which is further away from most tourist areas and halfway up a little hilly street. This place was recommended to us by our walking tour guide, so thank you Miguel! When we got there on a Tuesday night the place was absolutely packed with a very varied crowd, but we managed to get three seats by the corner of the bar. The place had a huge variety of small tapas; there were meats, veggie options, and desserts, with each dish being only 1 euro! Beers were about 1.60 and a glass of cava (sparking wine) was 1.50 - such a steal! Honestly, the concept was just so genius and it was such a fun and unique experience, and the atmosphere was so lively, but also really laid back. Maybe it was because we were seated right by the bar, but the service was great and super attentive, refilling our drinks right on cue and offering clean plates at just the right time. Highly, highly recommend checking this place out, and I wish we had something like this in Toronto! We ended up paying about 15 euros each ($22 CAD) for about 7-8 tapas, 2 drinks (beer/wine), and 2 tequila shots per person, which was not bad at all! Great place to enjoy some super cheap food and get a little bit tipsy on a budget :P Plus you get to experience some local Barcelona life. Honestly the entire street where this place is located is super cool and lively, with tons of people just sitting out on patios chilling and eating even at 10 PM at night!",
