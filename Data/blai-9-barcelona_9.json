    "We tried to come here for tapas our first night in Barcelona and it was late so they were only serving drinks. \u00a0Other tapas bars had food so we went elsewhere.Tonight we arrived early and the tapas was great! \u00a0They even have vermouth on tap! Most of the items are served in little cups indicating their price and none of them are on bread, \u00a0but little blinis and crepes. They have the best presentation of any bar on Blai. It filled up quickly and it's one of the harder places to get a spot on the patio.",
