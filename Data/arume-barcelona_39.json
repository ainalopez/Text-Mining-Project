    "Holy Crap!! This place was rated a 5* by people on Yelp & Trip Advisor. They were right on. I had the croquettes and my wife had grilled sea scallops both were out of this world. The main was Wild Sea Bass & a very unique Vegetable Ratatouille Cannelloni! Both were outrageous in flavour. The bartender made us \"House made Baileys\" for free...twice!!! This was an excellent adventure accompanied by superb food. We left happy & full. If you get a chance...go!",
