    "When I was in Barcelona, after a long day morning of shopping, we dropped by this small bar for a bit of energy. Lovely tasty seafood. A glass of wine. What more does one need to rejuvenate?In fact, I ate at Bar Mut three times over that week. Two lunches and a dinner. Servers were all up on the freshest seafood and best preparations. I particularly love cephlapods (not fried), which, they accommodated beautifully.",
