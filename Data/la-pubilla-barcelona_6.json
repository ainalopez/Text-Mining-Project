    "OMG the place and ONLY place to go for lunch! \u00a0If you are near here you just found your lunch spot for the entire duration of your stay, their LUNCH menu changes DAILY! \u00a0I went there 3 times in a row consecutively and everyday was a different menu. \u00a0Try and get a lunch reservation otherwise you'll be sitting in bar area or facing a wall. \u00a0Their food is so ... godly great, you just have to experience this. \u00a0Top quality meats, drool worthy sauces... I could just go on and on. \u00a0Their lunch price is just $15 EUR/ person including either 1 bottled water/ fizz water/ beer/ wine for FREE!! Only restaurant I know that does this, this place gets packed fast! \u00a0And mostly locals dine here so you know it's good!",
