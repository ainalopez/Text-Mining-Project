    "This was the most authentic and non-pretentious Catalan food that we ate while in Barcelona. \u00a0The lunch menu was delicious and generous, and, at 12 Eur (13 Eur with a coffee) for 3 courses plus a half-bottle of tasty red wine, the price was unbeatable. \u00a0The lentil soup was particularly recommendable. This is definitely a place for locals--at least some degree of Spanish is probably necessary, and I didn't hear a word of English from the other tables or from the servers while we were their.",
