    "Had an excellent experience dining here. We were glad to have found this place, so far the best indian food we had in our Europe trip. Their tandoori paneer was authentic and sizzling like how it is served in India. We also had Bombay aloo which tasted like Punjabi dhabas back in India. Besides food, the waiters were very courteous and promptly kept checking periodically to make sure things are fine. Will definitely come again if we visit Barcelona in future.",
