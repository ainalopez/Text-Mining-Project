    "the best freaking thing that ever happened to me in barcelona/spain/the world. my friend and i came at like 930 which i suppose is somewhat early for typical spanish dinner/tapas time, but we were hungry, however we were seated right away. everything is super delicious: squid ink croquets, egg with catalan sausage, anchovies, crispy beef, scallops with iberian ham and some of the daily specials. just get anything, we ordered 6 dishes and they were AMAZING. cavas is also on point at this place.",
