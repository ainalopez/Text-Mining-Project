    "Noticed the line on this place and had to join the crowd. Definitely a great choice.We (two people) did the meat sub with three sauces, absolutely the best decision. We took treat to the waterside with our cava and beers to enjoy with the scenery. Yes the extra sauces do cost a little extra but its totally worth it. Its the crisp outside and soft inside of the bread that wraps its love around the deliciousness of the fillings.I definitely do recommend you try this. We split one sub between the two of us only because theres just so much food to try in BCN. Always stay satiated, not too full. Have some bites here, and some there to make sure you can try a little of everything!The supermarket at the other end of the block has a wider selection of cold cavas and beers to accompany your fabulous snack along the port side.",
