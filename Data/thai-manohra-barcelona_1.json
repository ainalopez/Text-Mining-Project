    "Decent Thai food, which is hard to do. They also use a more Thai level of spice in their dish, so if you like your food with a bit of spicy hot, this place is for you! ( sadly, most of our friends don't like the extra spice)The place and the food just misses a special something. We have been a few times and nothing has really stood out to us. I should say we do go because we live close, but wouldn't travel across town for it. They also do a good take away, which we have used a few times and the food retains the in restaurant standard.",
