    "We decided to try 336 after reading the positive reviews and its close proximity to our hotel(Renaissance). We all had the fixed price dinner for 27 euros which included three courses and sangria. It was fabulous. The starters we had (prawns, asparagus, and mozzarella cheese and tomato salad) were all excellent and very large portions. The entrees were all excellent as well. Steak, sea bass and salmon were good sized portions and very well prepared. We are going back again tomorrow!! We might try the fixed price Tapas dinner which looked awesome for 19 euros.",
