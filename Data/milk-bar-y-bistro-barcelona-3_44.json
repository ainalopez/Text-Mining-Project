    "Great atmosphere, great food and great service. I dragged my grumbling family here for breakfast and they we're not disappointed we tried eggs florentine, French toast (yum!) and eggs Benedict- all were fantastic. Plus the menu was in Spanish and English which helped the non-Spanish speaking in the group.",
