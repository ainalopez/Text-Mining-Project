    "This is a great restaurant. My husband and I dined here last night. I had the Dover sole which was delicate and delicious! My first dish was the tomato, eggplant, and mozzarella salad. It was great, too. The restaurant is lovely inside, serves professional. And the owner gracious. The prices are also reasonable. \u00a0One of our most enjoyable meals in Europe!",
