    "Something for everyone! I regret that we never managed to just shop for food souvenirs because I'm reasonably certain the place would have been splendid, but it well enough for dinner to keep me happy and I'll likely stop in the next time I'm in Barcelona.I began with a delectable salad covered in good balsamic with a grilled round of cheese on top which I cannot describe with words but to say that it was nice to have something green again, which a lot of restaurants seem to neglect. I then had an utterly delectable dish of meat and wild mushrooms with a side of potatoes that where whipped and seasoned into a state of creaminess almost like heavy bisque. My tablemates had a lovely fishcake [I believe, she wouldn't let me have any] with squid ink risotto, and a very tasty cheeseburger that I did manage to sample a bite from. We savored the meal with a bottle of white wine, which went well with everything. Desserts, from a rather entertaining menu that I've added a photo of, were difficult to choose, but we settled on a ridiculously rich dark chocolate soup with a pair of biscotti and the Robespierre lemon meringue tart, which was bright and not too sweet. Certainly a place worth going, though I'm inclined to agree that the place might have been a little understaffed. Our waiter seemed quite busy and was often difficult to get the attention of.",
