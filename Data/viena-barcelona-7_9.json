    "Charming old place. Simple beautiful \"flautes\" (baguette sandwiches). No. Nonsense place that appears not to have changed all that with the times. Everything was fresh as can be. The only place we saw the croissants come out of the oven and onto our plate at breakfast time. The Iberian pork \"Alpino\" sandwich also deserves a mention. Also not too expensive.",
