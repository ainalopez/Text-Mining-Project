    "I never thought I could find pasta that tasted has good has Babbo in NYC but here in Barcelona this little gem proved me wrong!The pasta - and we ate a lot of it, is \"blow your socks off\" outstanding!!The bread almost brought tears to my eyes, it was perfect - the right amount of crust - indescribable!I had the spaghetti puttanesca and my boyfriend had the trio of pasta. It wasn't just great - it was excellent! \u00a0They even sent out tastings of other pasta dishes for us to try. We also had a bottle of the recommended Rioja and our bill was around $120 euro.If I'm lucky enough to visit Barcelona again - this will be on my list!",
