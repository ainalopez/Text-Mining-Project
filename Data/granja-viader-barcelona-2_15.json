    "This place oozes charm and history just as thick as their chocolate! It's been around since the 1800's. \u00a0Small intimate cafe just steps from La Rambla. \u00a0Xoxolata \u20ac3,10 with whipped cream (suis) \u20ac3,70. Perfectly thick and not too sweet so it paired well with the sugared churros. 2 orders of xurros \u20ac1,65 which came out to about 6-7 lopped xurros. Come when they first open at 9am, xurros are fresh! They allow take away and credit cards too.",
