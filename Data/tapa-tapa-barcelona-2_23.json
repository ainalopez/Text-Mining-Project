    "We stopped by here just for a drink and stayed for about an hour. It's right on the water and has a really great view of boats passing by. They have pitchers of sangrias and we got a large one (one liter) and it was only \u20ac18. It. Was. Sooooooooo. Delicious. The tapas looked good too from what we saw at other tables but we were just there to lush it up and the sangrias got that accomplished. Would definitely come back here for lunch.",
