    "We arrived in Barcelona on a Saturday, mid day. Before our apartment was ready we went for lunch/late breakfast. \u00a0We were quite jet lagged rum out overnight flight from Boston. The staff greeted us and we're very accommodating of our limited Spanish. \u00a0The menu is full of scrumptious eggs and burgers. \u00a0They also have a wonderful selection of teas. Our meals were wonderful, full of flavor. great value as well.",
