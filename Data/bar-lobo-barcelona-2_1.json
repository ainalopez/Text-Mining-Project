    "Nothing special about the place, food is okay but personally I wouldn't come back here for food. Service is average at best. We had patatas, fried eggplant, \u00a0squid and some veggies. All a bit too oily. \u00a0The potatas had way too much aioli even for a person that usually asks for extra aioli. Save yourself for some place else. It's a trap.",
