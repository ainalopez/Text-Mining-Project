    "My family and I visited Barcelona for the first time and was looking for a good restaurant for dinner. after doing some research on yelp, we found 336 with one of the highest reviews. Even though the chef's workers had just left him and was only taking previous reservations, he was kind enough to let us eat there with some pleading. The food there was a absolutely amazing, top-quality for a reasonable price. My parents ordered a 19.99 course meal with around ten courses including wine. They were completely stuffed and could barely finish the dessert. On the other hand, I had one of the biggest hamburgers I've ever had, in addiction to one of the best. All of the ingredients paired perfectly with each other for a satisfying taste. The chef was nice enough to take a picture with me and my brother and wish us a good rest of our trip. In conclusion, this was the best meal we had during our trip to Europe and definitely recommend!",
