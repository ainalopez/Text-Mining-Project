    "While in Barcelona, we were looking for an authentic and not too-expensive place to eat. All in all we spent a very nice dinner here, and I can definitely recommend it!The restaurant is not too big, and was almost filled at 21:30 on a tuesday night. We were lucky and got a table instantly, people arriving after us had to wait, but the turnover was pretty quick. We ordred a beer, which came in bottles, and variations of pate, which turned out to be three kinds of dips/pat\u00e9 with bread. It wasnt mind blowing, but it tasted nice and was served quickly. For main course we chose the wild bore stew, which was perfect!!! The mest was soft and nice and delicious! We also tried the spinach canneloni with codfish. I could not find a trace of the fish, but it was delicious nontheless. For the sweet tooth the menu contains a variety of deserts, which we did not try. The service is efficient and friendly enough, the price is affordable at under 20\u20ac for beer and food incl starters. The restaurant was frequented modtly by spanish customers, which I see as a good sign, as it is nice to escape the herds of turists wandering up and down la rambla. So, as mentioned above, I am definitely recommending this restaurant!",
