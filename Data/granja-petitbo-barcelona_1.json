    "Great brunch place for anyone in l'eixample or touring the sagrada familia in Barcelona. I ordered the Nini juice which was this pineappley drink and a order of huevos rancheros. The juice was pretty delicious, light and airy and was perfect for starting and energizing me for the morning. The huevos rancheros came on a bed of refried beans, mushrooms, cheese, and a tortilla. It was topped off with some yummy sprouts that were sort of bitter enough to cut through the heaviness and grease of the beans. The huevos were 11 euros and the large juice was 4.I'd definitely recommend this place for brunch in the morning when all the popular brunch places all have queues. There is plenty of seating and the waitstaff speak English! Definitely going again!",
