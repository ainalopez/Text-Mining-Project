    "Great food and even better service. \u00a0Super pleased. \u00a0Highlights for us included Paella (mushroom and risotto for me and black paella for my girlfriend), octopus...bread with tomato, etc. \u00a0Inside seemed a better choice as the street is pretty busy with traffic for any outside choice (hit this place right at 8 with no reservation and no issues...8 seems to be a nice split where ever we go between Barcelona culture and US dinner time for worker bees like us).",
