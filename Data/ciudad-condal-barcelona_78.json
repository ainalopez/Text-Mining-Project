    "Delicious tapas, friendly service, really lively and fun ambiance - Ciudad Condal has it all! \u00a0The hubby and I were in Barcelona for a few days during our summer vacation and stopped in Ciudad Condal based on a recommendation in Rick Steve's book. \u00a0We are both vegetarian so we were concerned that we wouldn't be able to eat very much here. \u00a0We figured we would stop in for a drink, maybe some patatas bravas and then head elsewhere for a full meal. \u00a0However we were really surprised by the amount of vegetarian options. \u00a0We had a bit of a wait to get seated on a Wednesday night but we made our way to the bar, grabbed some cava and eventually 2 spots opened up. \u00a0The server was awesome and, despite our language barrier he was able to direct us to several veggie options. \u00a0They were all delicious and left us stuffed and happy. \u00a0I wish I could remember the names of the dishes to help out fellow Veggie Yelpers but just know that you'll have plenty of options. \u00a0We tried a few other tapas spots during our trip and Ciudad Condal definitely had the coolest ambiance and the best food.",
