    "Outstanding in every way. Excellent value and delicious food. They do indeed turn people away, but only because the kitchen is tiny and cant handle more than about 15 diners per seating. The chef/owner Christian is great and only wants to ensure great service for his diners. The one bad review of this place is an embarrassment (check all his other negative reviews and know that his critique can be safely ignored). I am an american and ate here on back to back nights and would go back again tomorrow but its closed on Sundays. :) the fixed menu is the best. I had cazuela and NY steak the first night, then razor clams and roast chicken the second. First night was a heavy, delicious meal. Second was lighter and simpler but still fantastic. Desserts were not spectacular, but decent. Plus I was so full it was hard to eat them anyways. I don't write a lot of reviews, but this place merits it. Highly recommended!",
