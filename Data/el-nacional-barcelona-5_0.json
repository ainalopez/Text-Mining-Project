    "It was difficult choosing a place to go to as we were a bit overwhelmed at first but after finally making three rounds and deciding on a place we realized they are probably all delicious.We got there around 11pm and unfortunately they weren't serving anymore rice dishes so make sure you realize that you might not get paella if you get there late :(I won't go into detail on the food we ordered because I don't honestly remember it but El Nacional has a really cool vibe especially for late night meal/drinks either with you and the significant other or a bigger group. Caters to all tastes and interests. We almost missed out on it but decided to make a last minute trip our last night there and don't regret it at all!",
