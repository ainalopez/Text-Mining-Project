    "This place was everything we needed on our last night in Barcelona. And by that I mean AUTHENTIC. When you have to order using sign language, you know you're not in a touristy place.Reasonable prices, very quick service, delicious flavours and a buzzing, local atmosphere.The room is an awkward long thin shape which adds to the local caf\u00e9 feel but do go early so you get space at the counter - it filled up very quickly after we arrived. You'll be sitting on tall stools or standing, not as uncomfortable as you may think. Definitely recommend the cheese. Oh and the and chillies! They're not too hot but rather charred to perfection. Vermouth is of course mandatory.Don't go here if: you're looking for something super creative or particularly different.Do go here if: you want something simple, affordable, typical and tasty.Enjoy!",
