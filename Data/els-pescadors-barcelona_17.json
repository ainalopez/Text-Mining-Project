    "Getting quality ingredients is a birthright to natives and it really shows. \u00a0We were at Enoteca having dinner and asked to speak to the chef whom btw was just an awesome individual! \u00a0We asked for a place he would recommend and he said that he lived in the area and said that the rice here was amazing. \u00a0I want to clarify it is rice soupy rice and not paella. \u00a0So no socarrat here.We ordered the cuttle fish in ink, the foie with blue cheese and pears, and the \u00a0mussels with ginger.What can I say anything cooked in it's own juices can not be a bad thing. \u00a0The foie with blue cheese and pears were simply amazing. \u00a0the rice dishes that we ordered were the fisherman's stew, and the rice with morcilla and mushrooms.The fishermans stew was good but as with all that comes from the sea. \u00a0It was a bit briney but the textura of the rice was perfect not mushy not hard but firm and with a little soup. \u00a0The morcilla and mushroom was perfect not too much minerality from the the sausage but rather subtle. \u00a0We also order the bacalao with potatos and romesco. \u00a0I personally do not really enjoy the salt cod texture but this dish embodies what is really catalonian. \u00a0The potatoes were done well the fish had some bite to it and the sauce was ever so nutty and with a little spice. \u00a0I will be back to finish and eat more food from your beautiful bounty and was a little sorry I was a little hungover to eat more. \u00a0Cheers and happy eats.",
