    "Wine is amazing, 5 stars for that! And an amazing and very tiny shop. Have 4 dishes, sausage, tomato salad, fried fish and fish on bread. The food is not my exact type of flavor, but an experience for sure! If you want to try something special, try fried fish. The fish tastes good, but the look of eating the whole fish is a bit frightening. Good for easier lunch or starter.",
