    "We are currently trying Mexican restaurants in each city we got to - throughout Germany, Vienna, Paris, Madrid, etcetera. This is one of the really good & well organized places we found. The food is fast & very good, the cocktails are delicious and every cocktail on the menu is available without alcohol (which is great if you have a pregnant wife with you that \u00a0desperately wants a cocktail). The place was packed and the five waiters and four barkeepers were really busy the whole evening, but they kept an eye open and we got everything served really quick. Since we were sitting on the first floor above the bar it was really entertaining to see how organized they were (even though they had a new barkeeper with them who still needed to learn). Compared to our favorite restaurant (the Mexicana in Braunschweig, Germany) it was different, but just as good! An honest recommendation",
