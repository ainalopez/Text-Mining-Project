    "Excellent tapas! Show up early if you don't want to wait. We showed up around 8:30pm and there was already a 30 minutes wait. Once seated, service was very fast considering the crowd. Best of all, the food was fantastic! Prices are very reasonable too. Staff was not chatty. I'll blame it on how busy they were.",
