    "Incredibly slow service. After being seated, I wasn't give a menu for another 15 minutes, which is really annoying because the paella takes about 30 minutes to cook anyway, and I was starving. Considering the time it takes to make the paella, it would be better if customers could order as they wait, so the food would be ready when customers were seated. The food looks better than it tastes, but that's because the food looks really good. The majority of the people here were tourists, and they all ordered the paella. Overall, good value for money. Not a great place to for solo diners.",
