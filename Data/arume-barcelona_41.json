    "This place is DELICIOUS! Everything we had was top notch, from the bread basket to the chorizo tacos, giant fried prawns, scallops with ham foam, goat cheese stuffed croquettes, and the main course PAELLA! It was hard to stop eating, everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. We also tried the Blackberry Mojitos- it does not disappoint. I will definitely be going back next time I visit Barcelona. This place is a must try for any foodie. You should definitely make a reservation!",
