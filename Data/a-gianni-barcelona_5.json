    "It appears that I will be echoing the chorus with another 5-star review for this excellent Italian eatery in Barcelona. \u00a0As an opening prelude to my dinner, Piatto Salumi Misti consisted of a large assemblage of Italian cured meats: Mortadella, Speck, Guanciale, Salami Milano, and San Daniele, served with homemade baked flatbread. \u00a0All cold meats were of high quality and taste. \u00a0Next up for me were 6 fresh Oysters on the Half Shell from Normandy: another big win! \u00a0And the pasta special of the day, Pappardelle ai Funghi, made with Porcini and Shitake Mushrooms and fresh homemade egg noodles, was quite delicious. \u00a0Meanwhile, Diane very much enjoyed Provoletta, a creamy melted cheese concoction similar to fondue, and her pizza topped with ham and Emmental, Parmesan, and Mozzarella Cheese. \u00a0Portions were generous, and all food we tried was well prepared. \u00a0Dining quarters were small but comfortable, reflecting a cozy informal ambiance. \u00a0And, service was friendly, proactive, and highly competent. \u00a0While it was raining cold drops like cats and dogs outside, enveloped in the comforting embrace of this pleasurable ristorante it felt quite tranquil and warm inside. \u00a0Whether as a tourist or a native, I would gladly dine here again!",
