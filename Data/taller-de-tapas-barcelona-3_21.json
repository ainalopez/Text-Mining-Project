    "The great thing about 1-star reviews is that they do not take very long at all. \u00a0Atmosphere is your typical brasserie style, service was just so-so, and the food was absolutely horrible. Poorly flavored pasta, low grade meat, and just below a standard that I normally refer to as a minimum. So many great places to eat in Barcelona, this one should not be on your list unless it is the only place open and even then I would question my choices.",
