    "Ended up at this place since we couldn't get seated at Cervecer\u00eda Catalana, which is a very popular tapas bar on Carrer de Mallorca. The girl at Cervecer\u00eda Catalana directed us to Vinitus, saying that \"the food there is as good as here\". Though some in our big group of about 15 were initially pessimistic, we thought of giving it a try. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service. They serve excellent tapas and have a decent selection of wines. The icing on the cake was the dessert. My only gripe is that they don't serve big bottles of water!If you are in Barcelona and like tapas, you should try this place.",
