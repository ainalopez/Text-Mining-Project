    "What can I add that he previous reviewers have not already said? Arume was truly a highlight of my trip and had some of the most memorable food. The grilled octopus was accompanied by a seaweed and garbanzo bean sauce. Each bite was a delicate softness that released savory goodness. Amazing. The seafood paella came with big, juicy prawns that were tender. Admittedly, the trek out to his restaurant is somewhat out of the way and not in the most clean area of the city, but do not fear. Your path is clear and will reward your efforts. Your hosts will seat you and answer all your questions. They will suggest truly great wines to pair with your food choices. Every bite was delicious. Seriously. I would very easily highly recommend Arume to any traveller. I hope you make it out there and enjoy the food as much as I did!",
