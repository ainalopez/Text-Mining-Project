    "I went to Arume after finding it on yelp on my trip to Barcelona. The restaurant itself is very cozy and romantic, exactly what I would like to see in a Spanish restaurant. The staff is very friendly. The food was delicious. I had the paella and my cousin had the duck with rice. I think I liked the duck better. The blackberry mojito is good but it's 8\u20ac. I don't it's worth it for the price. It's very sweet for my taste. We also had a ceviche which was also very good. Overall good food but nothing extraordinary.",
