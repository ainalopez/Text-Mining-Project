    "Sadly, we picked the only place in Barcelona with bad food. This was the worst Paella I have EVER eaten.My heritage is Spanish and I grew up on Paella at my grandparent's home. \u00a0This was a mixed seafood Paella with old bits of calamari and one prawn cut in half on top. The dish had no trace of saffron and was in a heavy oil laden gravy that tasted as if it was cooked in a soy sauce- AWFUL!!!! . I should have sent it back to the kitchen, but we we starved before a show and had no time to do so. I have worked in the food Industry most of my adult life and have never experienced such a \u00a0culinary travesty. Perhaps due to popularity of the dish from tourist they felt the need to serve us something not even befitting for street animals.",
