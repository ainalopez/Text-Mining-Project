    "Stumbled upon this place while walking toward Picasso Museum and remembered seeing it in my Lonely Planet book. Heard great things here re: their cava and tapas. A cup of house cava was only 1.3e. They definitely fill up your glass with the cava, and boy, was it deliciousss! Sparkling and nice, crisp, taste. A little more on the sweet side. For tapas, we got the sardines, which look not so great, but were delicious for 5e. They garnish it with bits of chopped onion and pepper, and that really added to the flavor. The sardines weren't fishy-smelling at all. Also got a tapas dish of 1/2 salmon 1/2 cod. The cod was better imo. They're always crowded but for an excellent place like this, you just gotta PUSH AND SHOVE your way through.",
