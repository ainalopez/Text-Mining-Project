    "A bit overpriced. I agree with previous reviewers that they did tend to offer the crowd pleasing dishes (mostly deep fried) to some customers, but not to us. While we were waiting for almost an hour and watching what others ordered we knew what we wanted and what to avoid.Our favs:Baby Squid with chickpeas - a very humble looking dish packed with richness and flavored.Baby clams - cooked with bits of ham.Grilled squid with vegetables. Squid was plump and juicy.So-so:Razor calms - a tad bit on the rubbery side for me.Deep fried artichokes. It was good just as most other tapas restaurants.Despite the long line, service was on point and we didn't feel rushed.",
