    "This place was great fun! \u00a0Crowded & noisy, with great staff who managed to provide quick service above the hubbub. \u00a0We had a \u00a0few glasses of really good house wine. The Tapas was fresh, appealing to look at and \u00a0generous in size. It was tastier than several of the other places I've been. Best of all the tapas on offer was supplemented by fresh trays from the oven of croquettes, potatoes or hot goats cheese passed around by the staff. Highly recommended.",
