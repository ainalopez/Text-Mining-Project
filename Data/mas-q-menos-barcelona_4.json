    "While around the vicinity of my hotel, I noticed many outdoor seating restaurants, do I gave this restaurant a try. \u00a0I mainly wanted to try local tapas dishes. \u00a0The staff was eager to get me seated and take my initial order, but everything fell through after that. \u00a0I ended up waiting quite a bit for subsequent orders of tapas and had to ask for the bill three times before getting it (with an attitude from the waiter). \u00a0With many choices to dine in the area outdoors, I would not recommend eating at this restaurant.",
