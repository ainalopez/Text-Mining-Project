    "We just came back from our dinner at the Surf House Bar - and we would definitely recommend it to everybody! We had nachos with guacamole as a starter and a crab burger plus a kind of Beef Burger(sorry we forgot the name) with homemade fries with bbq sauce \u00a0as a main course. All our food was very tasty and seemed to be freshly made. The strawberry mojito was delicious as well, however, the wine did not taste very good. Also, the stuff was a litte indifferent but still ok!",
