    "I really enjoyed the food here. Plenty of options and a nice twist on the same tapas you get everywhere else in Barcelona. Little issue with the service, ordered the aged steak and specifically stated medium. Waiter brought out beef tarter and INSISTED this is what we asked for. I stated not only did I say \"aged\" which clarifies which steak it was, but I provided a temperature. Another waiter came over and handled the issue really well. Steak would have taken too long to finish since we were at the end of our meal so we went for a quick chicken thigh dish which was good. Beautiful restaurant and really good food. Besides the hiccup, I highly recommend",
