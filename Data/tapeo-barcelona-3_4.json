    "Best tapas we had in BCN. Had the Pincho Moruno (lamb skewers) which were mouth-wateringly tender. Patatas Bravas were some of the best around. The spare ribs were falling-off the bone and had a really nice glaze on them. Stuffed squid was the only thing I didn't like, it was a little tough texture wise and I didn't care for the flavor. We liked this place so much we came here a second time and I had a few repet dishes \u00a0but got the Oxtail this time which was braised and pressed with a little bean puree, nice and rich.Sit at the bar, order a clara(lighter beer w/ soda), talk to your bartender, relax and enjoy.",
