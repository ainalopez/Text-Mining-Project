    "Amazing brunch place! I came here with a friend a couple weeks ago and after the meal had to mentally add this beautiful place to my favorites.I ordered a sandwich with brie cheese, and caramelized garlic that was one of the best sandwiches I've had, and for dessert we shared a coconut bread with mascarpone liquid icing. It was so so good, I cannot even describe. The entire meal was like out of a dream where you feel like you're so happy you could fly. Also all the meals were presented beautifully.There were SO MANY PEOPLE. Oh my god, we god there at about 1:30 I think and had to wait about 30 minutes to get seats (we were two people), and there were groups of people waiting outside all around.The waitress was a little disoriented, maybe because there were so many people, but she brought us everything we wanted, and was nice, so that was good. The man at the counter putting people on the waiting list was also nice and accommodating.We were sat outside which wasn't that fun because it was cold and windy out, and we were on a big table next to other people, and the group next to us was arguing about things, so that was distracting, but it really wasn't the restaurant's fault. I didn't really like being seated next to people that closely.A little expensive, but the portions are really big too, so it compensates.So in conclusion, amazing amazing 100% amazing food, so good I can't describe, presented really well, with the only inconvenience of tons of people, the big table (with no privacy) and it was cold, and a little overworked waitress.If there hadn't been those things I would have given 5 stars because for the food and the locale it deserves it.Will come back! Love it!",
