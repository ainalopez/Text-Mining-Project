    "I came here with a visiting vegetarian pal on recommendation from fellow Yelpers and other blog posts and we had a great meal. \u00a0The wait was a little long for lunch but we were prepared for that, and meanwhile the friendly host kept us well informed while we enjoyed a couple of seats by the window and caught up. After about thirty minutes we were escorted to a cute table on the other side of the restaurant (in, back, to the right and into the next room) and even though the place was packed it did not feel crowded or overly noisy. \u00a0I am not a vegetarian but it seems to me that with food as flavorful, fresh and hearty as is on offer here there's something for everybody. \u00a0The place is clean, efficient and has plenty of options. \u00a0Some of the experiments are a little wacky (the Cuban banana risotto my friend tried was nearly overwhelmed by the fruit) but all in all a great place for a healthy, tasty meal.",
