    "Great food. Found via yelp. I would like to give 5 stars, but service was so slow it was incredible. It took over 30 minutes for them to take our order and another 30+ for the first food to come out. We ordered appetizers and main dishes and they came out in odd orders. However, the food was terrific! \u00a0Octopus, Burrata, Artichoke and Chicken Paillard are all very good. Bring your patience and you will have a great experience. We will likely go back and will update review if next experience is different.",
