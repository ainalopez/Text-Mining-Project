    "3.5 \u00a0stars rounded to 4. Here is the breakdown: nice location and atmosphere. quick service. However, they permit smoking, and you may struggle to enjoy your meal with tobacco smoke traveling up your nostrils. A couple at an up-wind table immediately on my right are lighting up their second cigarette in the last 7 minutes, and I want to vomit. Let me quickly finish the review and head out of here. The food: goat cheese salad is a keeper. \u00a0 Fresh greens. Cheese is nice. They don't add dressing, and I like it that way. Stuffed mushrooms: unremarkable; I ate mine, but they are nothing to write home about. Fried squid was left piled on my plate. It is not salted at all, and I am the first person to complain about too much salt in dishes most people find perfectly normal. Bottom line (khe-khe from the smoke): I would definitely come for the salad, but nothing else.",
