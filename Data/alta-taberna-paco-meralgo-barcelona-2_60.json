    "Ok , this is number two, first off they are open on Sunday nights, second this time they set me at the bar which was nice as the first time solo I had to face a wall (not as much fun). Ok now the food part: the oysters were supreme Galician oyster big and sweet (@ $4 each it's important they were good, Id say worth it). Tuna tartar was fantastic and the rabbit cooked in garlic and parsley although small was something you really chew off the bones and enjoy. House wine by the glass pairings were perfect, a very very fine experience. ( also their grilled cockles looked amazing, I/you? must try)",
