    "This little place is a hidden gem for pizza, not real easy to find so thank goodness we were able to, look for the red umbrellas. \u00a0Fresh pizza dough fills the air. \u00a0We were a little tired of the Tapas so need a break. \u00a0The pizza was fresh, very tasty & hit the spot. \u00a0They bring out olives & flat bread for an appetizer which was perfect. The olive oil was tasty & fresh The sangria was Devine ! Nice big jugs with just the right amount of fruit, sweetness & chilled to perfection. \u00a0Out waitress & waiter spoke English & were very helpful A must try !!!",
