    "The food here is outstanding and cheap. I had nearly every cold tapas, and they were all excellent - I'd heavily recommend the goat cheese and fig. Space was a bit of a concern, but with the side tables, there was plenty of space to talk and eat, and it was just so satisfying to order something and get it within 10 seconds.",
