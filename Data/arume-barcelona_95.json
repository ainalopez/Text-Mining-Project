    "Our dinner at arume was really gerat! We heard about the restaurant via Yelp so we decided to try it out especially because we wanted to try the paella there. We made a reservation which was a good idea, because it was almost fully booked. The restaurant is located in El Raval a rather plain quater, in a tiny street where you would definitely not imagine a stylish restaurant to be. However when you come inside there are different contorted dining areas that are decorated really nice. For dinner we had goat cheese croquettes and seafood Paella - food porn! Both dishes were so delicious we wanted more. Also we had a bottle of \"Joaqu\u00edn Rebolledo Godello 2014\" which was a perfect match to the paella! The staff was really friendly and courteous. We loved this place!",
