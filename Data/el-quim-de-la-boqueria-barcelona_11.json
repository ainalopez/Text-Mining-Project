    "I would definitely come back here again, but with others so I can order and share more. I arrived here super early so there was no wait or anyone for that matter. Look, I'm used to eating a hearty breakfast by 8-9AM so that's what I did.FOOD: Baby squids and eggs, their signature. A healthy portion of food, a little bit oversalted for my taste, but still pretty good. I also got the razor clams as I love razor clams, pretty delicious, but I definitely had some grits in mine. They needed to wash it more. Surprisingly, the other stand nearby had a much better plate of razor clams so I was kind of disappointed given this place's hype.SERVICE: Direct, forward, but fast and efficient. I was more adequately warned about service being a bit cold and direct here so it didn't bother me at all. The one guy I had did start cracking a smile towards the end with me. AMBIANCE: Its in the Boqueria, you're not here for fine dining, but hearty quality local food. During the peak hours of the Boqueria, it is definitely hectic and crowded. If you're able to get up early and have a large breakfast, than beat the crowd and come here when they open! I did it and am glad I got to enjoy my time while eating delicious food. PRICING: Surprisingly a little more expensive than expected for farmer's market stand food. Some of the items were easily over 15-20 Euros for a dish which adds up quickly when you want to try variety of items.There are menus in English, just ask and they'll give you one.",
