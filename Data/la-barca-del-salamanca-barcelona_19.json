    "Good restaurant- excellent choice of Spanish seafood cuisine, \u00a0professional wait staff, excellent service. \u00a0Fresh seafood and fish choices, as well as a huge selection of platters for larger groups. \u00a0Great choice for a crowd wanting to share and try different items. \u00a0Only complaint is that whoever gave this a \u20ac\u20ac rating is delusional. \u00a0It's a \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac or \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac place. \u00a0Very few entrees under 15, many over \u20ac25.",
