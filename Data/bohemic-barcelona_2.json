    "After reading the NYTimes article, I was able to get the 38 (Euro) dinner menu consisting of 1 app, 3 entr\u00e9es, and 2 desserts. The meal itself was phenomenal especially after eating tapas for the past few days. The highlights were the traditional potatoes as the appetizer and the earl grey ice cream dessert served at the end. The waiter recommended a great wine to pair with our meal and it was probably the best meal I had in Spain.",
