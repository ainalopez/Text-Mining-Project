    "I agree with all the folks giving this place a 3 star. \u00a0They are nice. \u00a0The empinadas are fine, food is decent, but nothing thrilling about it. \u00a0Not worth the 5 stars. \u00a0Except for the lasagne, our raviolli of the day and both empinadas were not hot, hopefully we won't get sick. \u00a0Price is great for students and folks eating on the cheap, but there are good other cheap eats in Barcelona.",
