    "While wondering the beautiful streets of Barcelona, we stumbled upon this lovely find for a spot to grab some food. Upon entering we thought the place was too nice for our casual attire and budget wallets. However, after examining their wine list and food, we thought we should just go for it and what a great evening it was! The space is intimate and d\u00e9cor is charming. It was like I was brought back into Brooklyn, NY and happily enjoyed my glass of wine as well as the live jazz. The food portion is on the smaller side, but we ate lightly that night and loved the dimly lit atmosphere. This is a cool place, a mighty cool place!",
