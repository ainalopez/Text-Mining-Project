    "As far as Korean food goes in other countries, this is the real deal. Quite possibly the best bibimbap I've ever had (I've had many in New York and Tokyo), and the kimchi and other small plates were just so scrumptious. I came back a second time and had a raw fish bowl with vegetables and rice, which was very tasty as well. Also, the prices are great and there is plenty of seating with a nice ambiance.",
