    "I love Kaiku. My in-laws are Catalan, and because my mom-in-law is such a fantastic chef, we don't venture out to eat too often. But when we do, we come here!We have a good friend who lives in the building above Kaiku, and he knows the chefs personally. What does that mean for us? It means the best seats in the house and a personal greeting from the chefs. Everything I've had here has been phenomenal. I love keeping these things a secret amongst friends, but they really deserve all the success. Try anything and everything from here. And if you're a little nervous, ask the server. And yes, they have menus in English.",
