    "Food: Loved it. The patty was huge, the bread was fluffy, fluffier than I'm used to back in the States. I liked the ketchup/sauce trio. Seemed like they're made in-house, not sure. I had the classic burger, which was standard. We also Ambiance: Chill, well-lit.Service: Ordering was simple, and I liked being given the chance to stand and ponder a little bit about what I wanted. Didn't feel rushed. The server was friendly. My friend had ordered a dessert but it didn't come out. We flagged someone down and we paid and ordered on the spot, no biggie. My friend asked for another spoon for me but they said each little yogurt cup came with one. A little later, however, they came by with a spoon. I don't know if they had to take it from another yogurt lid or what, but that was pretty cool haha.If I had more time in Barcelona, I would probably be back!",
