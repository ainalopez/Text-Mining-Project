    "Ridiculously tasty hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Amongst the many tourist trap restaurants, Toreros seemed the most benign on pricing. Two standouts were the roasted pimientos (roasted peppers with a generous sprinkle of huge salt crystals) and the lomo a la gallega (pork loin in Galician style). Perfect first dinner in Spain!",
