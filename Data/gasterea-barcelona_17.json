    "Finally found least touristy tapas with the urgency of a NYC deli. Try the cold and hot pinchos. Each one we tried was very good - especially the veal loin with chimichurri sauce. Wine selection by the glass went beyond vino tinto and they also had what looked like sour cider they poured from 3 ft above the glass.",
