    "This place reminds me of one of my favorite brunch places in Sydney (Grounds of Alexandria). The ambiance is very relaxed and it contributes to the gorgeous decor of the place. The service was solid but what was amazing was my smoothie (rejuvenator) and ravioli (eggplant, spinach, tofu). Will definitely return.",
