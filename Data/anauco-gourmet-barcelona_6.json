    "After a long day checking out Sagrada Familia, my wife and I were pretty hungry and looking for a spot nearby to grab some food. \u00a0Anauco came up as a place with great burgers so we decided to give it a shot (missing burgers from back home in the States). \u00a0After our burgers arrived, we were wishing we hadn't come here. \u00a0This was the worst burgers we've ever had. \u00a0The meat had an unusual taste...so much so that neither of us could finish our burgers. \u00a0Instead, we focused on the fries (which were ok) and did our best to power through some of the burger.This experience was so bad that we are hesitant to even try any other burger places in Barcelona.",
