    "Great food, great prices. Very popular with locals and increasingly tourists. You won't get a table for 30mins+ unless you book. We ate around 10pm on a Wednesday night. Every table busy with people waiting. Quality food, great value, best to order off the daily menu, the hand written one. (that's the food the chef wants to cook!). \u00a0Super waitress made it a top quality night, plus meeting Matt & Charlotte (they shared their paella with me!) and we continued our night with them. The fried green chillis with salt are amazing, if you go for a main dish, they're quite light on vegetables, so best order vegetable sides.",
