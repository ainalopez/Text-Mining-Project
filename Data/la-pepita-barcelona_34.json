    "While waiting for our order to come, we were looking at other people's reviews (mostly good). And we had a mixed feeling, because...the place looksed rather touristic and the prices were not the best we encountered.But when the food came, I decided, this place at least deserves 4 stars! Food was great, especially the tapas. We had the octopus (sooo delicious), beef carpaccio (in the beginning tasted just okay, but after a while the taste grew to smoothness), Argentinian beef skewer (simply tasty!), Pepita's with sausage. Okay, the last one was actually their specialty, and considered as the main course: sandwich with flat bread. This was good, but not extraordinary, and definitely not as great as the tapas. But... If you ordered this, you can copule it with their fabolous gin and tonic (really, just \u20ac0.50 savings, ha!) And one last thing worth to mention: they are flexible! I wanted just a normal green salad, but they only had sophisticated salad with burata (for example) on their menu. But, the waiter took the trouble to ask the kitchen if the could serve green salad, although it was not on the menu. And they could! Even better, the green salad was not just iceberg sla with thousand island dressing (like most other places would do), but it was a great mix green salad with thinly cut asparagus, fresh dill and homemade olive oil dressing with sea salt salad. Amazing!In short:Skip the Pepita's and go for the tapas!Skip the sangria and go for the Marvelous gin and tonic.Enjoy!",
