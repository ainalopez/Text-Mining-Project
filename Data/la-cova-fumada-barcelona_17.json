    "I found this like gem on the recommendation of a friend who took a cooking class with my husband in Italy. I'm glad I did. The grilled artichoke was heavenly, mussels good, and bombas were delicious. Wash it all down with a house tinto and you will have spent a very reasonable sum for a superb meal. I bellied up to the bar and so should you as that's half the fun of a tapas experience!",
