    "We went to La Flauta on a Monday night and found a table quickly in the outdoor seating area. The waiter was very friendly and offered us menus in either English or Spanish. We sampled jamon (Spanish ham), patatas bravas (fried potatoes topped with mayonnaise and spicy sauce - delicious!!!) and gambas (shrimp in garlic sauce). Everything came out quickly, which was a pleasant surprise given the typical wait time for European meals. All of the food had great flavors! My boyfriend sampled a Flauta (sandiwhc) with Tortilla Espanola (almost like an egg omelette with potatoes) and said it was very tasty as well. We had gone to Cuidad Condal the night before and were glad to find another restaurant with food that was just as excellent minus the wait time. Inside at the bar area there is a glass case with a wide assortment of tapas - especially fresh seafood ones! It was like a visual feast for my eyes. The next time I'm in Barcelona, I will definitely return here!",
