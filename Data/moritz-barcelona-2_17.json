    "The beer was good and the bombas (spicy potato meatballs) were tasty (if a touch meat-pie heavy). Also tried goose barnacles (which cost 22 euros for a small plate), which our waitress had to ask inside how to eat (and which she showed us). Barnacles are odd looking things that look severely phallic (uncircumcised) - they are salty, briny, tasty, and unlike any other shellfish I've eaten. Certainly worth the experience but not so certain about the price.That's a limited sampling of the large menu here, but the beer was very nice and it's pretty clear they're going to do most things well.",
