    "Worst meal that we ate in Barcelona. Our seafood paella was completely flavorless. We told the waitress and she recommended we return at night because there is a different chef then - no thank you! Onion soup was fine. All of the serving plates and utensils were soaking wet when placed on the table and smelled like bleach. Crema Catalana and cheese mousse tasted like artificial vanilla plastic.",
