    "I went to speakeasy for NYE dinner and while Food was amazing but the service wasn't good. Felt like I was being ignored. They took about 15 min before I got my first course or even was asked anything. Then when New Years was about to ring in, I didn't get the complimentary champagne like everyone else in the house. Again, great food, bad service experience",
