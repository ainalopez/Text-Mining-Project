    "Seafood Paella was great, but ask for less salt!!! And I usually like my food on the saltier side. We were so thirsty afterwards. Tower of foie gras and goat cheese and caramel apple was umami flavor party in your mouth. Service was excellent, our waiter was adorable and even helped us figure out our evening plans. Sangria was so tasty. A little light on the wine, but it was refreshing.",
