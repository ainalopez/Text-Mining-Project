    "Came here referring to Yelp and the owner doesn't speak English at all. But that's not a problem! He pulled out his phone and translated every dish in the counter for us! And all of them taste so good! Sangria is good too. We got crab and pineapple, potato, mussels, and satin fish. My fav was crab and pineapple! So good! Owner is very friendly!",
