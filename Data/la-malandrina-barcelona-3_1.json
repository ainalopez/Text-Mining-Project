    "Steak steak and more steak .If you like meat n potatoes this place is for you.I got a giant steak with creamy potatoes and it was amazing.They give you a basket of bread with two different condiments one has raw bell peppers and onions in some sort of oil and vinegar mixture and the other is red pepper in oil both are great on the steak potatoes and bread! For about 10\u20ac ..it's a great deal !",
