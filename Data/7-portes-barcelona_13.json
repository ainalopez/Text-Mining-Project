    "Tradition...7 Portes reflects almost 200yrs of it. \u00a0Although the menu has been upgraded over the years to reflect the languages of its many global visitors, this 4x visitor loves that how consistent their food, service, and quality is at every meal. \u00a0From greetings at the door by tuxedoed staff...service personnel in crisp white uniforms...wonderful dark wood touches along the banquettes and name plates of famous visitors, 7 Portes echoes days of sophistication and glamour in dining.Wine options are terrific but of you're intimidated by the selection their house wines are lovely options at a nice price point for half or full bottle sizes. \u00a0Salads are fresh and not overly large in portion-sizes -- but it never hurts to have parties large enough to share and sample a variety of dishes. \u00a0Seafood options -- sampler plates or smaller servings of mussels, oysters, prawns, langoustine -- abound, but I visit for the paella. \u00a0From the \"rich man's\" version (meats and seafood) to more specialized squid ink versions, all are flavorful, beautifully presented, and consistent year over year and visit after visit. \u00a0No trip to Barcelona is complete without paying homage to the history, traditions, and flavors of 7 Portes. \u00a0Enjoy!",
