    "Compared with Barrafina in London, with its Michelin star, this place is equal in taste. \u00a0Service is brusque if you don't speak the language, but this is understandable given how busy it is in the shop. \u00a0The quality justifies a visit over the cost which isn't too bad. \u00a0Get the cannelloni with mushrooms and sausage (under the Catalan specialty section).",
