    "We ate there twice. \u00a0Both times were excellent. \u00a0First for the menu del dia. \u00a0I ordered the salad, which was supposed,to come with either chicken or pork. \u00a0Sine I do not eat meat they substituted empanadas. \u00a0The salad was actually many salads,in one. \u00a0A plate of mixed greens with a caprese salad on one side,a roasted vegetable salad on another side and a roasted fruit salad with cheese and walnuts on the other. \u00a0It was very good. \u00a0The second visit was for wine and tapas, also very good. \u00a0Be warned that seating is very limited and I have,never seen this place be empty.",
