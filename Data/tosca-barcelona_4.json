    "The food and service here is amazing. \u00a0We had gotten the red sangria, the ham/arugala/Brie/ balsamic glaze montadito, the grilled shrimp, chorizos, the mixed cheese / meat platter, meatballs, and the vegetarian chili. \u00a0This place gets busy so you might have to wait if you come during a busy time. \u00a0We came around 8pm, and waited around 10 mins, but the wait was well worth it.",
