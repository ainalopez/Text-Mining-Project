    "Cuines Santa Caterina was one of the restaurants that were recommended to us by a local as a restaurant that he takes his American friends to dine when they visit. Located in the Mercat de Santa Caterina, the decor of this restaurant is gorgeous. What I very much appreciated was the menu that an engineer can appreciate. It was a grid to break down their dishes by the type of cuisine in which the dish belonged, and the main ingredients it uses.We waited about 15 minutes for a table, and it did take a little while for a server to come ask us what we wanted, but they were also very busy, which I had a feeling was typical of the restaurant on most nights. We ordered three dishes, a mixed vegetable dish, a chorizo with foie gras dish, and a chicken paella. All three dishes were delicious, but I would have to say that the chorizo with foie gras dish was our favourite. I loved the chorizo, and my wife loved the foie gras.I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you visit Barcelona.",
