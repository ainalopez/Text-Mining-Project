    "I stopped here bc of the great reviews on yelp. I was super happy with the food and the service here. Majii (sp?) was my waiter, he was lively and sincere, fun and attentive. The vermouth \u00a0was delicious, as were the mushrooms and sausage tapas that I had. It's a great location close to la Sagrada Familia but it has a lot of locals rather than being overrun by tourists. It's a great spot for people watching whether your back is to the street or to the restaurant. I kept changing my location because of the blaring sun and found that either way that I sat I enjoyed the view. \u00a0I had one tapas plate, two glasses of vermouth, and a bottle of water and it only came out \u20ac12.30. \u00a0I almost left and decided to run back in to use the restroom and was pleasantly surprised to find that the upstairs room was chock-full of gorgeous men sitting alone at tables eating. The bathroom is tiny but it's well worth the visit.",
