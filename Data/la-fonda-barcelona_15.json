    "We visited La Fonda on the first night and I would've rated it as a 4- or even 5-star experience, however, we decided to visit it once more during our stay in Barcelona and it was a very disappointing evening.On the first night we were seated upstairs, where it was dimmer and had a slightly better atmosphere although the lighting of our table was extremely bad - we could not see into our plates as the light was a spotlight shining onto the floor rather than the table. We ordered paella and it was nicely arranged and tasty. The sangria was also very good and refreshing. Our waiter was friendly and welcoming and the food did not take very long to come.Our second night was literally the opposite as we were sat downstairs in the 'cellar' area. The light there was ironically better so we could finally see what we were eating. However, it took the waiter about 10 mins to bring the drinks, another 15 for the starter and we waited for the paella for an hour! We were told it would \"be ready in 2\" about 45 mins in, but with no apology whatsoever. The waiter seemed annoyed, uninterested, slammed the dishes and took ages to clean up the mess on the neighboring tables. The atmosphere seemed tense and definitely not relaxing. You'd expect a restaurant with so many visits per night to have a better system and a staff that could handle the stress. Therefore, I'd say give this restaurant a try but arrive before 8pm. We arrived at 8:30pm and were leaving at 10:30pm, unhappy.",
