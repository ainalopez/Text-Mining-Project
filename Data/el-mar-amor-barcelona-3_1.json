    "The Dude of Food walked into this really nice place after a soccer match and had one of the best experiences a foodie can experience. The new business owner, Hamid, had been open 2 days and was most gracious. This man is a great host. He explained that the paella is prepared fresh so it would be a 20 minute wait which was no problem. The plate is made for 2 but it was so delicious that I ate the whole thing. For 20 euros I ate like a king and the meal included a bowl of olives and a few beers. While waiting for the food to be prepared the staff all came and made sure everything was perfect.Great food. Great environment. Off the crowded path. Great staff. Go here.Currently I am planning a party for our crew here, it's that good. Tell them the American guy sent you.",
