    "We came to this restaurant by a recommendation.It was my first night in Barcelona and I wanted to start my vacation with some great seafood.Just to give you an idea of how much we loved the place, we came in at around 6:30pm and left around midnight. Yes, it is not a typo,we spend there five and a half to six hours, and we loved every minute of it.This is what our dinner consisted of:Appetizer: - grilled bread with some tomatoes and olive oil - deep fried mix of seafood: fish, shrimp, langoustines, calamariMain dish: - whole orada fish, baked in salt - special mariscos paella, with lobster, razor clams, clams, mussels.Drinks: - two pitchers of sangriaEverything we tried was more than amazing. Fresh seafood cooked to perfection.Service was outstanding!To top it up, our server Antonio got us some desert \u00a0and two bottles of coffee liquor, Licor Hierbas Olave, on the house.Unbelievable dining experience! We are coming back here again by the end of my vacation.",
