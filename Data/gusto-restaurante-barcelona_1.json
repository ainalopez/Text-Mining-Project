    "Our hotel (Arts) recommended this spot for dinner. My boyfriend and I both do not particularly enjoy seafood, so Spain was a bit of a struggle. I mean, c'mon- who eats at an Italian restaurant in Spain? In summary the service was great, but the drinks and entrees were yuck.Gusto is small but has several tables (little crampy) and two floors. They have a full bar, so you can ask them to make you anything that's not on the menu. When we entered, the manager greeted us with a big smile and was very friendly. We spoke to him for a bit on food options. He even went to check in the back to see if they had ginger ale (they didn't, but the effort was much appreciated). We started off with the buratta- very fresh and tasty. My boyfriend ordered the lemon chicken with capers as his entree, a dish he usually enjoys. They had put TOO much salt/lemon juice on it. So much that he was unable to finish his meal. I was more boring; I ordered penne. It was very good, but at the same time you'd have to be a pretty bad cook to screw up penne. We each ordered a cocktail from their menu- both of which were way too sweet and syrupy. We forced ourselves to finish them (expensive) and ordered gin and tonics instead.",
