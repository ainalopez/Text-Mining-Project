    "Caravelle is a great little breakfast spot. The baked eggs were delicious - my boyfriend loved the meatball one and I had the leek, which was really tasty. The serving sizes were generous and the service quick and friendly. However, the ice coffee was really small for the price and our flat whites were lukewarm, which took away from the experience.",
