    "This place is awesome. My brother, who is from Madrid, showed my wife and I this place and we came twice. We tried the paella and it was the only bad thing here. Gross pieces of overcooked / not that fresh seafood. Avoid.Salmon with leek and carrot sauce- Yes. Order this. It's good. Pork - Yes.Sweet chicken salad with mustard vinegar sauce - yesMushroom raviolis - yesWe had a delicious wine called El Mayor, it was SO affordable. We aren't used to wine being the same price in the restaurants as the store. So we appreciated the affordable prices here. The waiters speak English and are very helpful. Highly recommend this place. Lots of seating but come early, they get busy.",
