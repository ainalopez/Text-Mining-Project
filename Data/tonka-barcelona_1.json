    "Great brunch buffet. \u00a0Hummus, pureed peas, focaccia, cured meats. \u00a0I added an organic egg and a glass of Cava to my meal which made me feel more at home. \u00a0I almost grabbed some sweets on the way out but resisted then once we were out the door immediately regretted not. \u00a0The staff was nice and the place was artistic but cozy in contrast with most of the places we had gone to.",
