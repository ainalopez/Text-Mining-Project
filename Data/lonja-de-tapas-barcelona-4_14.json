    "At first I thought it was a touristic place,therefore we ordered only tapas but food was actually very tasty (we had shrimps, ham croquettes and baked Camembert). Service was good, fast and attentive (maybe because it's January?) but it was a bit pricey. For 1,5l sangria and 3 portions of tapas we paid \u20ac50. I would still come back though :-)",
