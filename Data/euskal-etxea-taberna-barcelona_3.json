    "Stopped by this pinchos bar after a great flamenco show down the street. Pinchos are small bites usually on a slice of baguette. They are pre-made and you can just go up and put what you want on your plate. It was a little less than 2 euros per stick. Tried a few things but they all left much to desire. The pinchos were all cold. There were also not many tables so people were standing by bars.Another thing I didn't like about this place is the service. I didn't understand the concept of the restaurant beforehand (didn't look it up on Yelp) so upon entering, I asked for a table for 2. The woman behind the bar looked annoyed and me and said there were so many open tables and I could just sit at one. I felt like since she saw me walk in from the entrance and I look foreign, it's appropriate to explain the restaurant concept. After sitting down I still didn't know what was going on until finally the waiter came over to explain what was going on. The whole restaurant was very disorderly.This place is probably fine as a very quick and cheap stop for a snack but there are better places for a nice or good meal. After an unsatisfying experience, I went next door to Lonja, which had amazing tapas!",
