    "My husband and I were tappas'd out and came across this very nice Japanese restaurant in our hunt for something different. We both have high standards for sushi and other Japanese food and were not disappointed. He got the chicken teriyaki which was delicious and came in a delightful ornate box. My Habanishi Special roll was very fresh and had a great flavor combination. The inside is gorgeously decorated with Japanese art and the staff was very friendly and spoke many languages, including English which we appreciated. Highly recommended!",
