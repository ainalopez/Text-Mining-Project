    "You must go here if you're a seafood lover. I'm convinced there is no place in the world as special and awesome as La Paradeta.I really wasn't sure what to expect here. We came at 11p on a Wednesday and there was no line. I sort of wish there was because then i could watch standard ordering procedures and mimic :)My Spanish is mas o menos and my Catalan is even worse so there were some communication issues. The guy behind the counter asked if we were eating for here or for to go. I told him for here and I thought he was going to seat us. Instead, he walked us over to the fish counter where they had at least 15 different types of seafood (mussels, clams, razor clams, oysters, crab, and more). I was so confused. I thought he misunderstood me and was going to sell me fresh seafood to take home and cook myself. Once we sorted our the confusion, I realized that you select the seafood at the counter, they weigh it, ask you how you want it prepared, and cook it for you.In the end, we got around 4-5 lbs of seafood and 2 beers for ~35 euros. Everything was fresh and sooo good.This would definitely be a contender for one of my most favorite meals ever.",
