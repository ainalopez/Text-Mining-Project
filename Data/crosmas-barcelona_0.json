    "Came based on the Yelp review and it definitely exceeded expectations. Service was excellent which has very hard to find here. Waiter asked what we liked and then made recommendation. He then brought us two fresh fish to choose from., a domcie(?) or lubina. We ordered the cheese board and the grilled Lubina. An excellent last evening meal in Barcelona. PS-it is more expensive to eat outside than in",
