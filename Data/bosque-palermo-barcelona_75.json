    "If you are American, we would advise that you don't eat here. The owner/manager seems anti-American, which is \u00a0financially possible because most of their trade is local. We showed up at 9 pm with a party of 8 to see if we could get lucky. A number of tables, including 2 outside, were open so it seemed we might be in luck, or at least have a shorter wait. Instead, the manager took one look at our party of 4 adults and 4 teens and pre-teens and told us we needed a reservation and \"no inglese\" in an unmistakably hostile tone--truly the only inhospitable words we heard in this lovely city. Everyone in our party got the message loud and clear. \u00a0We found a much more welcome restaurant up the street. We could understand if they didn't want to fit us in, we just could do without the insult on top the rejection.",
