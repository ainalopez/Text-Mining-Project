    "I asked twice if they serve the Paella in the little black pan and they said yes. Yes I had this obsession about the pan but that's just my little request/wish for my birthday trip, I was so excited to see paella in the pan on my table. But then I guess it was the first day working of this young man and he didn't speak fluent English which is fine, I asked him once, and confirmed to another senior staff one more time about my request. However when he served the Paella he just quickly showed me then turn around and pour it onto the plates, I didn't even have time to take picture... They probably saw the disappointment on my face and after a while they re-presented someone else's new pan of paella for me to take pic before serving. The recovery action was polite and nice but tbn my appetite was pretty much gone already. I guess their paella was ok.",
