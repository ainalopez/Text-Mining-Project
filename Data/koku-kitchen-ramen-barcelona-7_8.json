    "Good ramen. \u00a0Solid! \u00a0I am not use to the ramen noodles, they use the thinner kind, but of course, there is more than one kind of ramen noodle. \u00a0I got miso, hubby got soja. \u00a0Kimchi was good and home made. \u00a0Also for dessert, they had taro ice cream. \u00a0We really didn't expect to eat ramen in Barcelona, but happy we found a place and would definitely return. \u00a0It's almost as good as what you find in the bay area in California.",
