    "We tried going on a weeknight, but the wait was 45 minutes (which we have discovered is normal at a lot of the good places in Barcelona around dinnertime. \u00a0We went back at 10:30 a.m. on a weekday, and it was still bustling with people. \u00a0The coffee tasted burnt, but the food was excellent, and despite how hectic it was, we were still served in a timely manner. \u00a0My favorite was the fried baby squid. Delicious!",
