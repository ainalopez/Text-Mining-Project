    "My friends and I arrived at Tucco shortly after arriving in Barcelona from London. We were pretty tired but starving when Yelp told us that Tucco was a short walk away from our apartment in Raval. Located down a quiet street in the Gothic Quarter, we were warmly greeted when we entered. Thankfully, the staff's English is better than my Spanish. We were able to make it through the menu and understand our choices. There was something on the menu for almost anyone (though did prove a challenge for the wheat allergic person with us). While there were many choices, I singled in on the empanadas.I've been a fan on empanadas since I first discovered them as a kid at the Spanish Bakery in St. Augustine, Florida. When I spent 3 months in Argentina, my love for empanadas only grew to epic proportions. Tucco's didn't disappoint.They offer several \"menu especiales\" - one of which is for the empanadas. Pick 3 \u00a0empanadas (choices are meat, spinach, cheese & onions, blue cheese & walnut, ham & cheese w olives, and cheese & leek w egg. Along with the empanadas, you get sausage, manchego, olives, and bread with tomatoes. You also get a beer or glass of wine along with your choice of dessert! All for a great price.I went with the carne (always a favorite... my gold standard), the jamon, queso y olives, and the queso, puerro y huevo. The carne was my favorite but the other two were equally delicious. Seriously, this meal was like being throw back to my time in Argentina and was a great way to start my time in Argentina. From the delicious food to the warmth of the people... it was an amazing way to start our visit in Barcelona and I look forward to going back when we return this is amazing city!",
