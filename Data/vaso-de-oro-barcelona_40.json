    "Neighborhood bar where it seems the locals like to hang. We stopped by for a quick bite and a drink of course!The men behind the counter are very straight forward but courteous and it was nice to see them wearing captain of the ship-type shirts. It was kind of old school and respectable.The tripe was off the charts incredible. It was so tender it \u00a0melts in your mouth. Cooked with garbanzo beans, it's super hearty so have it with a piece of bread, or two. Olives are incredibly good, the best to date, until I found it was stuffed with anchovies. In my mind I don't like anchovies. Yes I am mental, but I un knowingly ate half the plate. \u00a0We went a little early but it seemed to get full pretty fast. \u00a0 Great prices!",
