    "My fianc\u00e9 and I went here for a quick dinner before a concert, and it was fabulous. They were extremely accommodating of our time constraint, and ensured we had a wonderful dinner experience despite our needing to be done at a certain time. \u00a0The food was excellent--we had the seafood paella and the grilled fish of the day, and everything was done perfectly. \u00a0Highly recommend.",
