    "When I go back to Barcelona, I will run as fast as I can till I can get here. I'm not sure how we discovered this place, as it is kind of hidden and there is no sign (at least when we were there 6 years ago), but I am so happy we did. You can drink bomb cava for dirt cheap while enjoying simple Spanish tapas and bocadillos. You must go here when you are in Barcelona. YOU MUST. Unless you hate crowded places, then maybe not. But seriously, this place is worth the elbows.",
