    "Wow. Most places that I just stumbled upon were okay and more geared towards tourists, a nice flashy restaurant yet can barely deliver a good meal and does not know what a martini is. This places takes the cake. Seriously the best sushi I have ever had in my entire life. We ordered 8 different dishes, from sushi to pork, and it was all amazing. The DJ had the vibe feeling just right. Some late night dessert and cocktails to top it off?? Yes sir. Thank you for my best meal in Barcelona in my 5 months living here!",
