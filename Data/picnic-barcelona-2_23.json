    "Best breakfast we had during our stay in Barcelona. The receptionist in our hotel told us that brunch isn't really a big thing but this is the place in the city that does it best, and she was completely right. I would definitely recommend reserving a table, two of us arrived for brunch on early Sunday afternoon and the wait even for a bar space was over half an hour. However once we were seated the service was very speedy. We had the pink lemonade, the eggs benedict, a pulled pork sandwich and pancakes to split (I know, we were stuffed!). All the mains seem to come with a side salad and freshly fried potato cubes and everything was delicious. The eggs benedict seem to be the way to go, the kitchen was firing them out 5 a minute. The pancakes were also light and fluffy with fresh berries to top it off. 40 euro for brunch but we were still full 8 hours later!",
