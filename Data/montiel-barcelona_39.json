    "My wife and I stopped in without reservations and had a great time here. The service was excellent and the food was outstanding. We chose the 11-course meal paired with wine. Each of the selections were tasty and beautifully-prepared. The real standout for me was getting a chance to sample a lot of great Catalan wine. I hadn't experienced the range of wines from that region; highly recommended. We arrived as soon as dinner service started and were seated right away. By the time we left - a couple of hours later - the place was full. Flassaders is right off of Princesa. Easy to find and next to another interesting place to grab a variety of items - the Mercat de la Princesa.",
