    "This spot has an old-school feel that washes over you when you walk in. \u00a0The bartenders wear these navy admiral like uniforms and are all probably 60+. \u00a0The crowd, at least around 6 PM when there aren't swarms of people, seems to be mostly locals who know the bartenders pretty well. \u00a0All good signs.Sat down and ordered my favorite bar drink (Clara con limon --- beer with fanta), and proceeded to order the solomillo (sirloin) with foie, Patatas bravas, and boquarones (sardines). \u00a0I did have a friend with me, so don't judge! \u00a0All of the food was absolutely on point. \u00a0The steak with foie was moist, tender, and rich. \u00a0The grilled onions work really well with the steak and foie --- makes for some excellent bread dipping once you've polished off all the goodies. \u00a0The bravas are excellent --- how can you go wrong with crispy potatoes, mayonnaise, and hot sauce. \u00a0The sardines had a lovely tartness from the vinaigrette and were not fishy at all. \u00a0My friend, a Barcelona resident, says these are the best sardines in town. \u00a0I'll take her word for it.When it's all said and done you had yourself a very fine meal in a pretty cool atmosphere. \u00a0For those who can't speak Spanish there is English on the backside of the menu (saw a few folks struggle communicating with the bartenders I Spanish \u00a0... Who then simply turned over the menu to reveal English). \u00a0I'm pretty sure they don't accept credit cards and be sure to bring a good amount of cash if you're ordering the steak. \u00a0This isn't your typically super cheap tapas place --- The steak with foie will put you back \u20ac22 for a good 8 ounces. \u00a0It's a decent portion --- but I'm not one to share and can easily finish one plate by myself! It's worth every penny and then some. \u00a0I can see why many folks talk about how crowded and cramped it can get. \u00a0The bar area is very slim and I would simply recommend coming during off hours (6ish) where you can get a seat and enjoy yourself!",
