    "On our first night in Barcelona my wife and I went walking along the waterfront, La Rambla and Barri Gotic looking for a decent tapas bar along the way. We stopped and looked inside this crowded little tapas bar and thought it looked promising. We went on and looked around a bit more and decided to come back and give it a shot. Que Bueno! Was it ever the right choice!We ordered a bottle of Marques de Caceres Rioja 2010 and began selecting tapas from the bar. They warm them up for you and they were delicious. We tried the calamare, spanish tortilla, garlic chicken, pork kabob, a chorizo/tortilla combination and zucchini with chicken. All fantastic. \u00a0The small bar has so much character and the service was top notch. You just can't go wrong here!",
