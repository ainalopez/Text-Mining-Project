    "This is a great place and I understand the need for 2-month-in-advance reservation. But if you decide to accept reservations through online system only (!), and that system is as poorly done as it is right now... that's just plain inconsiderate towards your customers.If I'm booking for 3 people, please don't show me a list of _all_ times for a certain date and then tell me \"sorry, no tables available\". Jut show me already available times!I don't mind coming back every morning to check available tables 2 month in advance, but also going through dozen (!) of time slots just to find out if a table for 3 is anywhere within \"the reach\" is just nuts.So... yep, 1 star well deserved.",
