    "This restaurant was so charming and the tapas were delicious and very affordable ! The woman working behind the bar was really cool and helpful in revealing some of the mystery behind our choices (we still selected quite a bit at random and enjoyed the surprise)! Definitely a fun place to try :) we will be back for more!",
