    "Worth the hype, worth the effort in getting the reservation, amazingly unpretentious, very kid friendly. I have to say it's not often that I am so impressed by a super hyped destination restaurant. Tickets hit the mark in every way. The whole experience is ill put into words and must be experienced. \u00a0The magic of el bulli lives on in a whimsical form. A word about bringing kids here: do it! \u00a0The environment, staff, and even much of the food is incredibly kid friendly. \u00a0Our child is under 2 and he had an awesome time. \u00a0At no point did we feel uncomfortable having him along... though that's pretty much the rule anywhere in Spain... where you can find whole families (including ours) sitting at bars.",
