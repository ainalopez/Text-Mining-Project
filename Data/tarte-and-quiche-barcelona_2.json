    "I am lucky enough to live very close to this spot. Amazing quiches, always baked fresh and great variety to choose from. One of my favorite has to be tomato/mozzarella, it literally tastes like a bite of good pizza. They have everything though from classic quiche Loraine to crazy creative ones you never heard of. Just for quiches alone they deserve 5 stars but that's not all. They manage to make amazing pastries as well as homemade gelatos. Pure heaven! It's a pity they are closed on weekends.",
