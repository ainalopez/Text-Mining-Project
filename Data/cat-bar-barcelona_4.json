    "One of the meatiest-feeling veggie burgers I've had. The Mexican burger wasn't as spicy as I'd hoped, but I was full for 7 hours! The roll was way too big for the burger and a little stale. The brava sauce here didn't have a spicy ketchup feel like other places in Barcelona -- it was more like mayo and hot sauce mixed together..?Yes, there *is* cat decor all over the walls (^._.^)\uff89The porter was one of the best I've tasted. I wish they sold it in growlers.",
