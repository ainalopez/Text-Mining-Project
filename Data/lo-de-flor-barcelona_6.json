    "Best food I had in Barcelona, hands down. From the wine, to the service, to the preparation of the food and ambiance, this place is a total winner. Our group was lucky to get a seat in this small establishment, but I'm so happy we did. It was actually pretty hard to find since there are no big signs. We had the Rillet, Pate, Stracciatella, Entrecote, Beef Tartare, and Chocolate Cake. All of it was amazing and every plate polished off. We ordered the Luberri Rioja which was also very good.",
