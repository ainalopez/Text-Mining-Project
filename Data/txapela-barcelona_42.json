    "Our group of 4 stopped by here for a quick lunch. We got seated quickly, but they seem understaffed. We had to flag down our waiter twice to put in our orders for drinks. Ordering was easy, since they have an English menu and a placemat with pictures of their tapas. When our first wave of tapas came, our waiter forgot to provide plates and silverware until we reminded him to do so. The tapas were standard fare and the sangria was strong. It was clean, but would not come back any time soon with so many other restaurants to try.",
