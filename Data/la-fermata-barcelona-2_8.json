    "Great way to sample Catalan pizza without getting a whole pie. \u00a0Pieces are cut to order and sold by weight so it's great to get as little or as much as you want. \u00a0The pizzas with Iberico bacon are tasty but each one has a different tasty from salty to sweet so be sure to ask first.",
