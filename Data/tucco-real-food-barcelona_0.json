    "We are here right now. It is AWESOME! I am seconding all the positive comments from others, and drinking another sip of my delicious house wine.More seriously/specifically/tangentially... My wife and I are here with her parents who are picky eaters on their first visit to Europe. Andrea at the front was amazing explaining the menu (including what empanadas are to pops in law), and helping us out to put together an amazing several course dinner for four that totaled under 40 euros.We (including new honorary spaniards Chuck and Dianne) recommend this place to everyone!!!",
