    "We stopped by Vaso de Oro for a \u00a0\"snack\" of sorts, if you can call Steak and Foie Gras a snack I guess. A slab of steak hot off the grill topped with a huge lobe of melt in your mouth Foie Gras. I have never tasted anything so earthy and decadent at the same time. It was sincerely unforgettable. Have a glass of the house beer to wash down all that meaty goodness. You'll need something to cut the fat.",
