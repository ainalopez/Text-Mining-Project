    "Decent spot for breakfast. Yelp steered us here and we have mixed reviews.1. The spanish omlette with potatoes and onions was delicious. It is served as a slice with 2 pieces of tomatoed \u00a0toast2. The stirred garbanzo beans with some pork was good, but not amazingOur server was ok, just kinda weird - silent, blunt, and not very... nice. We paid 14\u20ac for breakfast. There are much better eateries in and around this place.",
