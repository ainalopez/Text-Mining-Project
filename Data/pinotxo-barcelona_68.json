    "So this place was awesome. It's kind of hard to get a table b/c seating is limited and this place is a hot commodity in the Boqueria. We somehow managed to smuggle ourselves in and snuck a table while others waited (dirty move, I know! But we were dead ass serious on eating here.) Our server was super cute and very sweet and made excellent recommendations. We ordered beers, grilled clams, croquettes, garbanzos, a squid & bean dish, and dessert. Everything was perfect. The place is right at the entrance of the market so this is the spot to sit and people watch - nothing like a spitting match between gypsies fighting over territory like hookers on the point. Great comedy. Just watch out because these wenches will get in your face as you are trying to enjoy your tapas and ask you for your euros.",
