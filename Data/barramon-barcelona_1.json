    "Nice cafe with outside seating. Wait-staff is friendly and helpful. They did not have Sangria, but our waiter offered an alternate that was quite tasty. I had the pork with mint sauce, we also had curry chicken and wild mushroom risotto. All were good, but the risotto needed pepper for additional spice. Spinach salad was fresh and tasted great with soft sheep-milk cheese and balsamic reduction. Barramon is a bit more expensive as compared to nearby cafes, but was a nice change from the Tapas restaurants which are plentiful in this neighborhood.",
