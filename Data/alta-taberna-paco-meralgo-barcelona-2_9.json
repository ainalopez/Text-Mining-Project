    "Our experience here as been spectacular. From the greetings- it was such a treat (not even regarding the food). The service is incomparable to any other place I have personally experienced. I personally would recommend the oysters, the mushrooms, fricando con , bomba, SANGRIA, even the first starter bread had me sold. I haven't ordered dessert as of yet, however I am already sold on that. The waiter Juan Carlos has been beyond charismatic as well as the director Javi who initially greeted my boyfriend and I made us feel eager to get started. If you are in Barcelona, this place is a MUST!!!! So excited for you to experience this restaurant.",
