    "Went for dinner while in Barcelona. It's a good place for dinner for Mexican food in Barcelona. Service was fast. Price wasn't too bad. Good place. Would recommend it. I had shrimp with mushroom burrito it was good. If u need spicy they serve spicy sauce on side it's red chilli sauce it's very spicy. \u00a0Drinks are good with reasonable price. It's right across from cathedral so on good \u00a0location. Dinner for two for with drinks under 50 euros it's not too bad in good place to eat near tourist place. It has young vibe \u00a0as well. \u00a0Service was quick. Waitress were English speaking and were helpful. Menu was in English so that helps who don't know how to order with Spanish menu. Overall good experience we had there. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for Mexican food in tourist area.",
