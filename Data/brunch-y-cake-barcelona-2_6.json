    "In a few words, an American brunch place with a Barcelona twist. Based on the the reviews we had to try this place out while vacationing here. We had the protein bowl, the ham and egg potato dish, fresh orange juice and cafe con leche. Everything was different and delicious. The protein bowl was full of different vegetables and the vinaigrette was amazing. The eggs with ham over toast tasted just right with 2 different sauces for 2 boiled potatoes. Overall a great experience, just expect a wait, this place doesn't close in the afternoon and is always packed!",
