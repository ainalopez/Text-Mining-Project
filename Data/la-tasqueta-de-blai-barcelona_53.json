    "This little gem is located on the Carrer de Blai close the Para-lel metro. Classic pintxo bar, around 40 different platters of treats arranged on the two level bar priced at 1 euro a piece and refreshed and rotated throughout the day. A place were locals pop in for a quick bite of lunch before disappearing as quickly as the come or to laze over some very well made cocktails, the mojito done with Havana club gold is particularly good, whilst grazing the excellent fare on offer.The music is good, the seats comfy, the service excellent and friendly and if all that isn't enough to put a smile on your face the bill at the end certainly will. Can't recommend highly enough.",
