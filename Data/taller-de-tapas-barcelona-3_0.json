    "Food: \u00a0Was very tasty and well presented. \u00a0Drinks: We had white sangria and it was delicious with some great orange and lemon notes. Ambiance: \u00a0this is the only reason this place did not get 5 stars. Smell inside was a little fishy for my liking as well as we battled nats flying around our food through out the meal. \u00a0Service: Great!",
