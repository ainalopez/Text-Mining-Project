    "Small preset menu for lunch: included an apetizer, \u00a0entre and drink for under 10\u20ac. And the quality you get for 10\u20ac is a steal. You could easily pay 10\u20ac for the entre alone at other restaurants especially if you're in a tourist area. Staff is over the top welcoming. Cozy relaxing ambiance. Its authentic, delicious food at a price locals would pay.Food was excellent. Tapas in the evening times.",
