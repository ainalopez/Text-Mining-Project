    "Good brunch but not the best in Barcelona. Sort of out of the way location compared to some of the other hotspots. Waiting staff was very nice and there was many English speakers in the restaurant. However, the food was solid. We had the pancakes with banana and walnuts, Huevos rancheros and the BB burger. The burger was very tasty, the pancakes lacked a little \"fluff\" but the yogurt on the side was great. Apparently the wait can be a little long sometimes (30-ish minutes) so prepare for that but the service seemed quite quick.",
