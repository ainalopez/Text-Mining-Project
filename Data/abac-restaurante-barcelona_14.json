    "Definitely make the trip to the outskirts of town to this 2 Michelin star gem. Set in the swanky modern hotel Abac you definitely feel like a VIP as soon as you enter. The grand tasting is rather daunting and the wine pairing is Herculean but it was the best meal of my life (sorry EMP!). \u00a0 The meal started with melon mojjitos made table side with liquid nitrogen and picked up from there. Other highlights included the best tomato I've ever tasted, smoked steak tartar, lobster, and something called \"smoked earths\" for dessert. \u00a0We opted for a more conservative pairing than their recommended \"glass per course\" and it was still excellent. Finally, we got a tour of the kitchen and menus of our meal. Is it worth the flight back just for this meal? I have a hard time saying no.",
