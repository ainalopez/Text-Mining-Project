    "Very good food. I was here for New Years and had their pre-fix meal. We really enjoyed ourselves. Lots of delicious flavours to eat and drink. The ambiance is a blend of old and new, done well. Service was great. I highly recommend dining here. The mango lassi is killer and a great way to soothe the pallet if spice is an issue.",
