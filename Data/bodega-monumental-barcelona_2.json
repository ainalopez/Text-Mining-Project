    "With last minute reservation, they were able to accommodate and squeeze us in on the New Year's Eve. \u00a0The restaurant is quaint with comfortable and homey feeling. \u00a0The prix fix menu for the NYE was fantastic. \u00a0We started with soup and seafood tapas. \u00a0Sorbet to cleanse our palate follow by lobsters and filet mignon. \u00a0Tiramisu, plate of sweets and coffee topped off the meal. \u00a0Wine and Cava were free flowing and the mood festive through out the evening. \u00a0All the guests were given a bag of NYE party favors and a small box of 12 grapes to celebrate NYE down in the Placa de Espana a few blocks away. \u00a0The staff were cheerful and friendly and were able to accommodate our lack of Catalan communication skills. \u00a0Will definitely go back and try their regular menu.",
