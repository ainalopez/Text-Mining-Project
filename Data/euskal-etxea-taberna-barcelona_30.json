    "Really a 3.5 star. \u00a0Came here around 11 pm on a Wednesday night after watching flamenco at the Palau Dalmeses and this pintxo bar (next to the palm tree) was hopping with a lot of young people and groups. \u00a0We grabbed a spot standing near the bar and muscled our way to the pintxos. \u00a0The pintxos were very good. \u00a0I tried the blood sausage with some aioli, a chorizo and pineapple in a croissant, a red pepper and beef croquette (all excellent), the white crab meat, a reddish codfish mixture (both average) and cava. \u00a0My friends liked the goat cheese, the artichoke/sundried tomato/olive, the brie, and didn't like the baked oyster as much. \u00a0I think it's Michelin guide recommended. \u00a0Fun place (you're standing so there's not much dallying), though the fact that there was a counter for people to eat alongside the bar made it hard to beat your way through those crowds.",
