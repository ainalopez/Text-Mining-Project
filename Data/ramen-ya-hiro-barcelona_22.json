    "I love ramen, and I make ramen at home. This place is delicious! They take pride in their food and it shows in the flavor and in the service. Super busy for lunch and dinner so get there early. Either the soy, miso or seafood broth are good choices, you can't go wrong. The gyoza are grilled and served super hot so be careful, but they are the best I've had! This is a definite must try!",
