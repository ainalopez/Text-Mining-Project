    "This is one of the best meals I've ever had. Barcelona is a great food city but among several excellent meals Arume really stands out. Hard to say off one data point if we got the awesome stuff or if everything's awesome but we got:Sangria: excellent, really refreshingBlackberry mojito: also excellentPaella: oh wow, this was exceptionalchorizo tacos: ridiculously good, probably the best dish of the nightprawns: Very good (hard to get a 10/10 on something relatively simple)burrata with guacamole: only okay to good, a little salty and overly gooey texture (I could have anticipated this)",
