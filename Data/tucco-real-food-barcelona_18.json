    "If you're looking for a nice sit down dinner, this is not the place. The food is great and very cheap but not for tourists. This is the type of place college students go to for dates and families go to for a cheap dinner out. If you do find yourself there the pastas are great! However I would not try the wine, go for a beer instead.",
