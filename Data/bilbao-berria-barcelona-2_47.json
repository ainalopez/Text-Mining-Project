    "Fantastic spread of tapas (and desserts)! Once look through the window at the range on offer and I was an instant fan.Just go ahead and pick whatever you want, the waitress will count the cocktail sticks at your table at the end of your meal.Also delicious cava.The waiters were friendly and most of them spoke English.For a fantastic view of the cathedral, relax after shopping and a chance to people watch, you can sit outside too.",
