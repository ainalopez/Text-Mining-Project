    "A pretty standard menu when it comes to tapas but they were done to absolute perfection. \u00a0Seriously, you can't go wrong here. \u00a0We dined at a 2-star Michelin restaurant (Enoteca) the night before? \u00a0 The quality of the food here simply blew Enoteca away. \u00a0Sure, no foam, no molecular gastronomy, etc., \u00a0but at the end of the day the ultimate question is how does it taste? \u00a0And this tasted out of this world. \u00a0Small place, make rez. \u00a0We came early (for Barcelona) at 830 and folks were waiting. \u00a0Servers tried hard to keep up and did pretty well. \u00a0Make no mistake though--you're coming here for the spectacular food, nothing more or less.",
