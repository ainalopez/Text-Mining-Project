    "I went here two years ago and would have given it a 5 stars without hesitating so I headed for Les Quinze Nits last Monday wtih a hefty blob of drool on my chin in anticipation of the culinary delights that lay ahead.I left an hour or so later disappointed.I had the tomato soup to start and it was the epitome of bland. I'm not sure what dropping a small cube of soft, non-descript cheese into it is supposed to do but it didn't add taste. Mrs B.M. had the patatas bravas, which were nicely done, to be fair.I decided to try the hamburger since I just fancied a nice cut of beef, nicely cooked that day. Again, the meat was cooked pretty much how I asked for it but the whole plate just lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. Actually, je sais quoi: flavour. Mrs B.M. asked for hers well done and got it medium. Now, given the predilection for meat in Spain, we expect beef to be cooked a little less than in Ireland so the \u00a0waitress was left under no illusion just what well-done meant in this case. But it still arrived medium.The staff weren't very friendly either.The saving grace was that the 2 starters, 2 mains and bottle of wine only came to \u20ac40. Maybe it was because I went expecting as good as 2 years ago that I was disappointed but given the reutation and queue, they should be serving up a bit better, in my humble opinion.",
