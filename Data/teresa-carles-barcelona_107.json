    "Amazing food! \u00a0My Salad was fantastic! \u00a0My only note would be that they go heavy on salad dressings and oil in their food, so if you don't like too much dressing ask for light dressing and light oil in your main dish. \u00a0Other than that they were fantastic. \u00a0The host/manager was so on point, we were in awe watching her seamlessly handle the restaurant while we were there. \u00a0Food super fresh and great menus. \u00a0Like the create your own salad option!",
