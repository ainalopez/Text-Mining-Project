    "Yum yum yum! All the tapas here are delicious! We asked the waiter for suggestions and he brought out some great tapas. The croquets, pan con tomate, meats... everything! The sangria was also AMAZING! Best Sangria we had in Barcelona. They have free wifi and the waiters are really friendly and helpful. Nice ambiance and location. Definitely recommend!",
