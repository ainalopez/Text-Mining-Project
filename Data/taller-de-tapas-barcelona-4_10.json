    "At least they comp'd the mussels after we informed them about how bad they were. \u00a0We arrived a little late at night (10:30 pm) which wasn't out of the ordinary for anywhere else we visited in Barcelona. They welcomed us in warmly, but then we felt very pressured to pick our dinner quickly. \u00a0Not the experience we'd had anywhere else. So, we decided quickly on our initial Tapas and after getting them were informed that they were closing in 15 minutes and it was too late to order more. If they would have just told us that when we first arrived, then we would have gone somewhere else. \u00a0Instead we felt rushed and highly unsatisfied with the experience.",
