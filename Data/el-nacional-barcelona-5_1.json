    "You walk in, unassuming, through double doors not so impressive - yet they take you to hall expansive and magnificent. At first sight, it's easily overwhelming. \u00a0But the eyes adjust and peer in search of menus, because from a place with this many options, you better reserve the precious real estate that is your stomach space walking around this yolk of a real estate in central Barcelona. Those of you familiar with Eataly - with different sections offering different offerings, it feels like how Eataly would feel if it were Spanish, more upscale, and sans the marketplace-feel (and sans a market, for that matter). \u00a0No grocery shopping here, but I was just fine getting cocktails.Because I'm a seafood girl - and because I had been eating meats and charcuterie for a week in Granada and Sevilla - my friend and I opted for the seafood section. \u00a0Meanwhile, we waited by getting a cocktail - and I'm only sad to have forgotten its name, because it was truly a memorable one. \u00a0I forget even the flavors, but I know it was delicious, and it comes in two glasses so you officially double fist. \u00a0What a luxury at just 12 or 13 euros! \u00a0Once seated, we ordered oysters on the half-shell, a local pasta dish named fideuas that was very good and different, and something yummy that came with giant prawns. \u00a0I'm sorry that this is all I can muster of the meal 3 months later, but I will tell you this was a place not to miss.Next time I go, I will explore more menus. \u00a0Thanks to other Yelpers, I see that less expensive tapas options are available. \u00a0I look forward to happily tapas-hopping within Nacional.",
