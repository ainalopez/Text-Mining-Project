    "This place is super tucked away on a tiny street sort of near La Rambla, but far enough away to be quiet. The waitress was very friendly and explained the menu in English.We ordered the spinach pine nut ravioli with Bolognese sauce, plus tiramisu and a peach juice and a coconut water (we were thirsty, and drinks here [in Barcelona in general] tend to be microscopic).The filling in the ravioli was excellent, and very well balanced in flavor. The pasta itself was a bit overcooked and the sauce was practically all tomato paste, giving it a special Chef Boyardee tinge where there really shouldn't have been one, given that they handmake everything.My mom loved their tiramisu because it was essentially a cup of whipped cream! I loved it because what little cake there was wasn't incredibly sweet or soaked and soggy.",
