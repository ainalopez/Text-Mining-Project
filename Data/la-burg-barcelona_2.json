    "Terrific hangover brunch/lunch without having to leave Sarri\u00e0. Late night at Otto Zutz? Too many chupitos anoche? La Burg is perfect for your weekend mid-late afternoon resaca-hunger needs. The atmosphere is pleasant and just dark and quiet enough to be suitable hangover ambiance. The environment is nice but still casual, don't even bother to wash those bar stamps off or attempt to tame the hair that still reeks of Jamboree or Opium!The veggie burger is surprisingly gourmet for Spain and all of the burgers can be served with fresca or huevo frito or carmelized onions or other delicious adornments. The milkshakes are apparently fantastic (although perhaps daring for a Sunday hungover meal) and the fries are delicious, as expected. The waitstaff aren't too hard on the eyes either ;)",
