    "I was sort of panicked when we first sat down at La Bombeta because we were surrounded by tourists which often isn't a good sign. Fortunately, I think we were just there slightly early as many Spaniards and regulars started arriving shortly after we were seated. Our meal was mostly a starch fest: patatas bravas, bombas, croquetas de jam\u00f3n and pan con tomate to start. Then we got a dish whose name I can't recall which was essentially beef with pimientos de padr\u00f3n; once it came out, others around us saw and started requesting the same. It was delicious. The chorizo was also fabulous and not to be missed.",
