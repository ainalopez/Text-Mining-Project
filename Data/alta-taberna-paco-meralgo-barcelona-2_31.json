    "Just amazes me that this place gets such good reviews. \u00a0I should have been warned when all the Yelp reviewers giving it so many stars rave about the tomato bread so much (really? \u00a0tomato bread? \u00a0which they charge you for by the way).At the time of writing this I've been in Barcelona for close to two months so I've been to quite a few restaurants and this is the worst one I've been to by far. \u00a0First, if you are traveling alone you will be forced to sit at the bar depending on which person talks to you at the door. \u00a0And it's a very tightly packed uncomfortable bar. \u00a0I went in close to closing just so I wouldn't have do that. \u00a0Didn't matter that tables were empty, i was told bar.Second, it's ridiculously over-priced for what you get. \u00a0As an example I got 4 razor clams for 9,90 euros. \u00a0I got 4 prawns for 13,95 euros. \u00a0And to top it off they are not even very good quality, mushy prawns and gritty clams.Third, I thought the saving grace would be the few different things they have on the menu that you don't see at other tapas restuarants. \u00a0I tried a cuttlefish croquette (they called it Obama, I'm assuming because it is black), very little cuttlefish so not much flavor. \u00a0 I tried rabbit \"cutlets\" which turned out to be rabbit bones overcooked with very little meat.Fourth, they had a chalkboard menu with plates of the day. \u00a0I asked the server what they were and he told me they were all out. \u00a0Not sure if he was lying (because not one had any indication they were all out) or what, but seemed pretty strange.It's a shame this place is even in business let alone has such nice reviews. \u00a0 So MANY nicer places around.",
