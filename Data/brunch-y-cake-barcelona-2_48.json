    "Great brunch area and when I saw the reviews on this place, I knew we had to go! It was just a walk away from where we were staying, so it was no excuse.We waited a bit to be seated and the hostess didn't seem very friendly. It's extra to sit outside, which in most cases, in Europe, that's how it works anyway. That was fine though, it was a bit chilly and we rather be seated inside. They have the menu in both Spanish and English so it's very helpful. Our waitress looked like someone killed her dog, she wasn't very friendly and seemed easily irritated. I ordered the eggs benedict on the waffle, it was a nice balance between savory and sweet and definitely hit the spot for a morning meal. My daughter got the chocolate banana bread, she was so happy she got it, the look on her face when it arrived was priceless. Our waitress wasn't phased by this at all, oh well. My husband got the eggs and potatoes hash with a side of iberico ham toast. Everything was delicious but how can you leave here without having cake when it says it in the name?! So we got an oreo cake to share, very decadent, I could hardly finish it.The fresh squeezed orange juice and cappucino were great ways to end our meal and wash everything down.It's a nice little stop and definitely worth coming in, but it lost a star because our waitress and service wasn't great. It's the standard in Europe, people don't work for tips, so they feel like they can act any way they want to.",
