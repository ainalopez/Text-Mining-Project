    "We ate on the terrace which was wonderful. Good views of the little plaza below. This was one of my husbands favorite lunches. The tomato and burrata salad, as well as the Caesar salad was very good. My husband had the mini Iberian pork sand which, which was amazing. He could not stop talking about it. I had the cannelloni which was very good as well. We didn't try any of the Japanese cuisine but it did look really good.",
