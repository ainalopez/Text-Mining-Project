    "Lovely little tapas bar that does fresh churros and a mug of thick chocolate - great way to start a mornings and a variety of other items but the churros and chocolate stands out as something unique - it is 4.5 euro and a great deal - they also have snails that I hope to try - just a nice neighborhood joint, worth a visit if going to the sagar da familia in the morning",
