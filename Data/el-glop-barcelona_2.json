    "Food (4.5 Stars) - I really wanted to try the Paella before I had to leave Spain. Unfortunately, Paella is priced per person and the minimum is two. This is when eating alone hits hard T_T. I had the assorted meat that came with smoked sausage, chicken, and two different part of beefm which was recommended by the waitress under the meat section. Not the best, but great! Sauvignon blanc of theirs were phenomenal!Service (6 Stars) - Although most of the servers were not good at all nor fluent in English, I did not have too much trouble asking. Plus, they have a menu with English so that is super helpful. \u00a0I had to charge my phone and I asked. They were more than willing to accomodate my need and was even willing to use the outlet inside the kitchen to have it near me. Thank you!!Ambiance (5 Stars) - It is seemingly really small restaurant from the outside and can be seen as creepy. Once I went in, two waiters were standing with one opening the door for me. The restaurant was completely empty! I was thinking, \"shhhhiiettt. Is this the low review number yelp bait?\" Few breathes later, I realized they have a spacious back dining room with open area kitchen. Just awesome to see well organized dining area with view to see how they are cooking.Overall, very impressive dining experience. I believe the food could have been more different if I chose the right menu. I wish I could go back and try their paella! It smelled and looked hella good. (drools)",
