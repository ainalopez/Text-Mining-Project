    "Tried the marinated seabass w/ strawberries and arugula, grilled octopus with snap peas over mashed potatoes and chocolate mousse w/ fig jam. All were delicious with a few glasses of vino blanco and a cafe americano at the end. Table space is tight but seating at the bar for 1-2 people usually available. Long list of tapas in Spanish and English so it's easy to pick out some unusual dishes on your own. Service is prompt and courteous for those not proficient in Spanish.",
