    "5 stars for service alone! \u00a0The people who run Etapes are so kind and incredibly accommodating. \u00a0The food was delicious, too. \u00a0My husband and I loved the cannelloni (best thing we ate in Spain!), the duck ravioli, the scallops and jamon and the lamb entree. \u00a0We went back twice. \u00a0Make reservations!",
