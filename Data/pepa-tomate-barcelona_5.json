    "so i try not to waste my time leaving poor reviews of places, unless they're really horrible, so if it appears all my reviews are about 4 stars its because i'd come back to these spots.we were taken here by a local so it's always a refreshing moment to know they trust this spot. the wait was a bit long and the prices were slightly higher than other places we had eaten at. if you're looking for 2-3 euro tapas hit the bars that serve tapas, but this is a restaurant first, drinks are secondary. the staples like pan con tomate and patatas bravas were better than most spots, but the seafood was exceptional. we had an order of calamari and an order of pulpo (which was a special for the night) both i've yet to find an equal while staying here in BCN. a few other dishes which all were as good as the next and better than most places we have eaten at since arriving. the service was good, friendly and attentive, although we stayed till close so they were able to give us more attention as the place emptied. the environment of the place was nice as well, that's three things i tend to look for when i eat out, service, ambiance, quality. value is a distant fourth, i mean you'd be surprised what i'd pay for if the dining experience was worth it. we ordered 6-7 dishes, split a bottle of wine, and had coffee at the end, it ended up costing around 60 euro.i read a person's review and it seems to be about their personal preference, i wouldn't go to a sushi place and order burger cause i was homesick, lol. additionally a meal like tapas is meant to be shared, discussed over, and the experience is about the interaction, so it's not surprising that they would come out at different times. not to mention, it's nice to know they were made fresh and not reheated. lastly, when in another country, is it really appropriate to expect everyone to speak english?",
