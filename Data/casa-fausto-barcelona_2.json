    "Mellow and comfortable ambience with an extensive and reasonably priced menu. I had the tagliatelle with garlic prawns and it was delicious. They do have an English menu, but not for the prix fixe offer, which I would have put more time into deciphering if it hasn't been taken away so promptly. The coffee was fine. My friend says this is his favorite restaurant in the neighborhood and recommends the seafood bisque if they have it.",
