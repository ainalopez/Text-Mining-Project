    "Do you want a true Chinese experience while in Barcelona? \u00a0Would you like to eat good cheap Chinese food on sticky tables and use kleenex as napkins? \u00a0Then you've come to the right place. \u00a0I am a Chinese American on vacation in Barcelona and decided to sample some of the local Chinese food. \u00a0I was not expecting it to be anywhere near as authentic as back home in California, but it was and then some. \u00a0The \"service\" is non existent and bordering on rude, the place feels and smells vaguely dirty, the furniture is worn down, there are large bottles of soy sauce on each table and the aforementioned kleenex. \u00a0The food was pretty good, real Chinese food, which again I was not expecting in Barcelona. \u00a0It was also dirt cheap.Be warned that this place appears to be extremely popular with 20 something Spaniards as it was super busy with crowds of young ppl waiting to get in. It was also extremely loud. \u00a0All in all, if you are on vacation and miss authentic Chinese food, I would rec'd this place. \u00a0You may wanna bring your own napkins though.",
