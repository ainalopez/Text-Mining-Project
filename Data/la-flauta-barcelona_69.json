    "This place was packed and I'm not sure why. Someone recommended that we go here. But quite frankly, they had very mediocre Spanish Tapas. And we've eaten at a lot of Spanish cuisine establishments. It was totally packed, we had to wait at least 30 minutes on a Thursday night. Our waiter kind of sucked. Couldn't give us any reco's. He said, 'They're all good!'. And generally, just felt like we were being moved through a conveyer belt of service. Will not go back. And wouldn't really recommend it to anyone. It's not even cheap.",
