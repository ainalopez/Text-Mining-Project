    "This place is supposedly the best vegetarian tapas place in Barcelona and it is absolutely true. The mini burgers are really out of the world. The fig vinaigrette on the salad is really good. The beet root crackers on the anti pasto is awesome as well. The lasagna and the mar & mountain were awesome choices as well! And add to it the sangria was super as well. Absolutely must try!!",
