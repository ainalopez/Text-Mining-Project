    "I would come back just for the pimento. \u00a0It was amazing, I killed the whole plate without sharing with my siblings. \u00a0There are plenty of standout tapa plates. \u00a0but the pimento had me a first bite. \u00a0The owners are very nice. \u00a0Since our Spanish was inadequate, my sister was able to communicate with the owners in Mandarin. \u00a0Don't let it fool you, because they whip up some pretty damn tasty plates.",
