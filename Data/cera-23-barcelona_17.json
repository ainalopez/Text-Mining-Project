    "Omg the food is so f*#king delicious!!! We had the pulpo (octopus) and it was pretty damn good. Not gooey, not leathery, perfect. The rice Volcano was orgasmic! Perfect point of the rice, great calamari ink taste and the saffron sauce was amazing. For dessert we got a crema catalana. The flavor was great and the caramel crust was thin, crunchy and delicious. Nothing like in a lot of places that put a thick horrible hard crust of caramel, here was awesome! Our waiter was fantastic. Funny, cordial, attentive, fast and very polite. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but not too bad. My best experience in Barcelona. Gosh I would go back to Barcelona just to have the rice Volcano again.",
