    "The servers are very friendly and this is a relaxed atmosphere. \u00a0You can order at the counter or sitting down, and they have a few tables outside with heat lamps for Al fresco dining. \u00a0We had the \"margherita pizza\" which was covered in tomatoes and no basil... So I'd call this cheese and tomato pizza. \u00a0Also had a slic of the bacon pizza, which was fine, but nothing special. \u00a0The rela star of our meal was the onion and cheese empanada... Delicious! \u00a0Wish we had ordered several of these. \u00a0The house wine was fine, a little bubbly. \u00a0There's a younger crowd here since it's right next to the university. \u00a0Would stop here again to snack on empanadas!",
