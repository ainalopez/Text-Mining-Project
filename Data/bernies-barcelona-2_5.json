    "Looking for Diner style restaurant in Barcelona around the center? Try Bernie's. It is located between the Gotic and Sant Pere, Santa Caterina i la Ribera, in Via Laietana. Decorated as a Diner the menu will fulfill your expectations including a huge selection of the Americana delicacies, from BLT to burgers including a good selections of cocktails and desserts. I ordered the Spicy burger. First good thing, they asked how do I want it cooked. It took a while to come, but what I found on my mouth was what I was expecting: A good, moist patty (200g, 7 ounces), with an OK bun and a really good spicy sauce with the right amount of Jalape\u00f1os, that gives your mouth that extra joy. I saw it is a place that the families bring their kids to celebrate their birthdays (maybe the house invites to the cake?). Stuff was nice but a little slow, maybe was because yesterday night was a really cold one in Barcelona. I didn't have the opportunity to taste their milkshakes but they look really nice!",
