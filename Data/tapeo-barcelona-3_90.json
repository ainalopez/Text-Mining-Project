    "Decent service, the waitresses speak English and they have an English menu. Has a bar atmosphere with small high tables. This place serves tapas with a twist. They have some traditional tapas on their menu (tortilla, patatas bravas, croquetas) but they have more \u00a0unique dishes that traditional tapas places wouldn't have. We came here twice for dinner just to try out all the dishes. Ordered ham croquettes (very good), burger w/foie gras (very good, tastes similar to Umami burger in LA), foie gras with egg dish (good but there is a strong mushroom taste), pork ribs w/ honey and mustard (very soft meat, good and sweet), squid ink pasta (big dish, tasted good at first but got too salty, couldn't finish this), seafood rice (similar to a paella, but way too salty), skirt steak (delicious), steak tartare (way too much salt- not good), catalan cream (tastes like a lighter, frothier version of creme brulee) and both types of sangria- wine and cava (both good). The complimentary tomato bread was delicious.",
