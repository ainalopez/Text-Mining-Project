    "Best meal I have had in a long time. We practically licked our plates. We had the organic beef ravioli in a cream sauce and the filet with mashed potatoes. I can't even describe the amazing things that were happening with these meals. Not only was the food top notch but the service was attentive and the decor clean and rustic at the same time. Do not miss this place!",
