    "Chose this restaurant after finding for places at the Apple Store at Plaza Catalunya. My parents could not walk any further so had to reduced the distance to less than 0.3 miles. We waited for 20 minutes before we were seated by the lovely waiters/waitresses. The staff there are very friendly. Ordered the beef & prawn (Gambas style) skewers, RAZOR CLAMS and grilled squid. As mentioned by other reviewers, the food was amazing and best of all, the waiting time for the food was short and quick. I would definitely recommend people to come here for Tapas. The price was slightly pricier above average but it is definitely worth one's time and money for this restaurant.",
