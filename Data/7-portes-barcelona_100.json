    "Went here on a recommendation from a friends sister who lives in Spain. Steeped in history, waiters and waitresses in white coats, this is a great place for dinner. The paella is very tasty and very heavy- you might need a nap after that one. 2 people can split 1 order. \u00a0We also had the fava beans with mint and the Catalan cannelloni. Nice wine list too and reasonably priced. Recommended!",
