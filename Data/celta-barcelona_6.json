    "The service looks arrogant but I don't think they are rude maybe just busy and typical Barcelonians? Usually the experience we had was warmer. Looks chaotic but everything arrived quickly, we were just unsure did they understand us due to very limited English. The place was packed and for a reason! Octopus was great as were the shrimps and peppers! Great value for money",
