    "We picked this place solely on its yelp rating and we're a bit disappointed. The food we ordered was good just not great. Some things were better than others. The mini burgers and the goat cheese were especially good. My wife had the duck special and enjoyed it. Very small selection especially for a tapas place. The restaurant is small period but that's part of its charm. The service was friendly but slow. Only one waitress for the whole place. Last but not least, \u00a0the neighbourhood is terrible. We had a late night meal and had to walk through the worst part of town to get back to the metro. \u00a0Nothing ruins an experience like getting harassed by drug dealers after dinner. Overall good just not worth its current rating.",
