    "i really wanted to check this place out as supposedly Picasso used to pop by for some sustenance back in yesteryear. i'd also heard it was quite an impressive building. the building is beautiful inside, some great inspiration for the interior designers amongst us.sadly it kinda falls off after that. clearly trading on its name and location. I would suggest a coffee and tapas in the front area before wasting your money on the main restaurant.the menu del dia was 24E, it's 10E in most other places. the salad was average with little effort put in. the pork loin was dry. my friends salad looked average too. service not bad, not great either. beautiful interior. pop in for a coffee.",
