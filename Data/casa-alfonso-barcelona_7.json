    "Excellent tapas, excellent service, and a very relaxing time spent with local Catalans in their element. \u00a0A bonus was that this was just down the street from our hotel. We had a mixed grill, potatoes, asparagus, and mushrooms, and all were beautifully prepared, presented, and most importantly, tasted wonderful. \u00a0I probably should have gone with a sangria or wine selection for drink, but I wanted a martini. The waitress bought the bottle of vodka to the table and let me do my own pour. \u00a0God love her!",
