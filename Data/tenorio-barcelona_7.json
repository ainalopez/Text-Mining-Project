    "The only reason why we came here is because our concierge gave us a card and said that we would get free champagne (or something, I don't remember). \u00a0The location is really good, the service was okay (though we never did get our free drink). \u00a0You do have to pay an upcharge to sit outside and they charge you for bread. \u00a0It was unremarkable enough that I don't remember what I ate. \u00a0If you want remarkable food for a great price, go a short distance to Ciudad Condal.My Two Cents: \u00a0Reasonable price, great location, however, there are a lot better restaurants around Barcelona.",
