    "This place is awesome! \u00a0We have been in Barcelona for four days now, and have lots of amazing meals, but this might have been the best. \u00a0Thanks Rick Steves for the recommendation! \u00a0:)The octopus was awesome, it is very difficult to cook octopus so it is not chewy, and La Flauta nailed it! \u00a0My husband was even impressed, and he is Portuguese and eats octopus all the time! \u00a0The grilled clams were excellent, the patatas bravas, everything was so good! \u00a0We ordered a delicious dessert of the day, a cake topped with chocolate sauce (we saw the table next to us eating it and they recommended it).La Flauta is a very cool tapas bar and restaurant, full of locals. \u00a0Definitely go here if you're in Barcelona, but go early!! \u00a0We got there at 9 and waited 45 minutes for a table. \u00a0Another couple got there at 7:30, and they did not have to wait at all.",
