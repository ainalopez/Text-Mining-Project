    "I came to eat here 3 times and rarely go back to the same restaurant when I'm travelling. \u00a0The food here is fresh and delicious. \u00a0You can accompany it with a glass of wine or cold Estrella. \u00a0My favorite dishes are the grilled shrimp, gazpacho, machego, and gnocchi. \u00a0The shrimps come out grilled and whole and incredibly fresh. \u00a0The Gnocchi are fluffy heavenly pillows that melt in your mouth. \u00a0I'm going to miss this place.",
