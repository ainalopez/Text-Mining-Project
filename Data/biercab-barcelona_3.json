    "I loved BierCab. Not quite sure what the owner's name was, but he was super nice to us on the first trip and even recognized us a few days later. The beer list was fantastic, and as a hophead, I loved getting to try European IPAs. They definitely give American IPAs a run for their money! They utilize a digital tap list that is displayed throughout the bar, giving beer type, ABV, color, and more. The food is fantastic - between the two visits, my girlfriend and I had both types of potatoes- the bravas (pretty good) and the extra spicy Biercab potatoes (one of the best potato dishes I have ever eaten), as well as cod fritters and calamari. Sadly my trip to Barcelona wasn't what I hoped it would be, but BierCab stood out to me as a fantastic business and on my next visit I will certainly pop in.",
