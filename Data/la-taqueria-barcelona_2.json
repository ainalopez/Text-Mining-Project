    "Great Mexican food, for Barcelona (important caveat, therefore tourists need to temper their expectations)- very busy at lunch time, therefore take-away was only option (despite the half-empty restaurant) - wonderful staff, and- expensive (40 euros for 2 without too much food), Recommended with caveats above, ok generally, but very good for Mexican in Barcelona",
