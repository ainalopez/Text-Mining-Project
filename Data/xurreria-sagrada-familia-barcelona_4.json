    "My husband found this Churro place & wanted to visit. It took awhile for us to find it but once we did - ordering was simple. Just point at the churro & order.We had:1) Dulce de leche churro - too sweet, had to remove some of the filling inside 3 stars2) Crema churro - fantastic Churro, just the right amount of softness & the cream inside was not too sweet. 4 stars3) plain mini churros with thick hot chocolate dipping - I like this type of churro because you can dip it directly into the chocolate! Warm & what a delight, not too sweet either! 4 starsThe store has a \"cart stand\" in the Plaza de La Sagrada Familia on weekends, in case you don't make it out to the actual store. Both locations serve churros & chips.Free wifi connection upon request! You can sit outside too, service was fast & friendly :)Family-owned little shop.",
