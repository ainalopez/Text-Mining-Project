    "Small hipster Tapas restaurant tucked away in several alleyways. We sat at the bar because we did not reserve a table ahead of time. First I started off with the red wine sangria. It was sweet and the alcohol was strong . Our server recommended 3 tapas per person. I ordered 4 - shrimp croquettes, cheese platter, cured salmon and fish paella. Out of those 4, the most memorable was the shrimp croquettes and cheese platter. The shrimp croquettes were crispy on the outside and when bit into they had a nice creamy consistency. It also came HOT so it really hit the spot. The cheese platter came with 2 goat cheeses, 1 sheep cheese and 1 cold cheese. Both goat cheeses were delicious and it came with this red dipping sauce that really brought out the flavors. The cured salmon was raw and had a sweet but savory taste. Finally the paella came with plenty of rice, a few pieces of shrimp and mussels and a bit too salty for my taste. Overall I was really satisfied with the food! Service - great! Our waiter gave us good suggestions for our dishes, explained what each item was and even gave us a free shot of mojito cocktail to taste.Ambiance - Awesome hipster place with nice music playing in the background, dim lighting.Overall - I'd recommending trying 2/3 tapas per person. If you like cheese definitely get the cheese platter!",
