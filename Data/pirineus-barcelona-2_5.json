    "By far the best meal I had while in Spain. \u00a0From Madrid to San Sebastian and then to Barcelona Pirineus was the best. \u00a0It sits on a small corner in a neighborhood area right next to the Joanic metro stop. \u00a0A few tables outside, maybe another 6 inside and a bar area make up the place. \u00a0The two things that really set it apart are the freshly made tapas and cooked meals and the service. \u00a0The staff is so friendly. \u00a0They were some of the nicest people we met in Barcelona. \u00a0After finding the place by accident we had to come again the next night. \u00a0Great home cooked meals from people that know there stuff. \u00a0Come here and spend a nice long dinner with family you've never met; you won't be disappointed.",
