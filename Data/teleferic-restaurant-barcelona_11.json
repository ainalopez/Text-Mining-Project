    "Wonderful small tapas place in Eixample, close to our hotel. \u00a0We came very early for dinner (7pm, early by Spanish standards) and were literally the only people in the restaurant for a while. \u00a0The waitress put us at ease and helped us pick out the best pieces. \u00a0Food was delicious and the wine was amazing as well. \u00a0Will definitely come back to this place when we are in Barcelona again.(Note: I give 5 stars to the top 5% of experiences, 4-stars for top 10%)",
