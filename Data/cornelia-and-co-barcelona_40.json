    "After two weeks in Europe we were winding down our trip and between the 6 of us we were all looking for something different for evening meal. I had a very flavorful udon noodle dish. \u00a0The udon noodles would rival Marukame Udon in Oahu which is the best place I have been to for udon noodles. \u00a0My wife had the spinach ravioli dish which I tried and thought it was excellent. \u00a0Others had a salmon dish and the burger...You can shop in this store for wine, cheeses, deserts and other things as well but they have it set up in a way that it is equally welcoming as a restaurant. \u00a0I could go to this place again and again. \u00a0Great place to sit down with a family (we had a group of 6) and a couple teens (one was 12). \u00a0No outdoor seating.",
