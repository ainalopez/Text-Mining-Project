    "This place was great. The indoor decor is light, and welcoming, but we chose to sit outside on our first night on our first visit to Barcelona. The menu came in English, and we asked about any specials. The staff were super friendly. We decided to try the cava sangria, and it was completely delicious as a light and refreshing sparkling beverage. I tried the house pizza (named after the place) with bacon, caramelized onions, capers, and an egg on top, yum. We also tried the grilled octopus, and it was great. Overall a moderately-priced, easy to get along in, and tasty out-of-the-way restaurant in Barcelona",
