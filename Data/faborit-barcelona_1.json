    "This place is a great spot for a healthy, tasty, affordable lunch!On our third day visiting Spain, my husband and I started craving vegetables, and a Faborit salad hit the spot.You arrive, pay for your salad (selecting if you want 4 or 5 toppings), and the select your toppings as the salad is made in front of you. \u00a0The 5.50 price was quite reasonable, and I enjoyed my salad.The outdoor back patio was a gorgeous spot to eat.Awesome find!",
