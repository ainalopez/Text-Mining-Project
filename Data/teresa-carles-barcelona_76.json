    "My wife and I both have to eat gluten free. \u00a0She is also veg most of the time. \u00a0 Agree with everyone else great place and if you have to eat GF and find yourself in Barcelona you must eat here. \u00a0We did not have reservations so did wait about 45 minutes but we say well worth the wait. \u00a0They have GF chocolate cake! \u00a0Wait staff very nice. \u00a0Near the Plaza de Catalunya.",
