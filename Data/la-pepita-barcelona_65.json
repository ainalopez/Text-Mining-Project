    "Cozy little restaurant, great way to spend an afternoon. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, even though the seating is a bit restricted and the restaurant is always full.The tapas menu has a great selection. Tried the melon and almond gazpacho with ham, calamari and the beef Pepita. No complaints with any of them. Everything tasted fresh and had great flavors. It is very reasonably priced for the quality.",
