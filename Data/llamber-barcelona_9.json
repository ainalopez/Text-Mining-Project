    "This was one of the best meals I have ever had, and I have eaten at Daniel, and other fine restaurants in New York.When we got to Llamber, we had to wait for a table at the bar; no problem. They served us complimentary spicy olives and our drinks were delicious.Upon being seated in the backroom next to the candlelit fireplace (I think we had the best seat in the house, no kidding), we were warmly welcomed by our waitress who was able to recommend an amazing bottle of Rioja that I'm still salivating over. Here's our review of what we ordered:(1) Cheese plate: SO good. We ordered the \"large\" portion and we were told it came with very stinky / intense cheeses, but we weren't deterred. Unfortunately, the last two cheese were so strong that we couldn't eat them, but the first four were amazing(2) Tomato bread: awesome, would highly recommend(3) Salmon carpaccio with ginger ice cream: sounds so weird, but was seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten!(4) Roasted vegetables: this was the one thing I would not order again; while the Romesco sauce was nice, the veggies were really nothing special(5) Sorbet + mini bundt (?) cake with hazelnut filling: OMG amazing, I wish I had one right now!!!Can't recommend this place enough, even just for drinks!",
