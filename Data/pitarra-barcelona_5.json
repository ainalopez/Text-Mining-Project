    "Great restaurant, I ate here my last two days in a row in Barcelona. \u00a0I had the seafood paella and the black rice, both were excellent. \u00a0They also are gluten free friendly and even had some great gluten free bread they gave me for free as an appetizer. \u00a0This is a very friendly and relaxed restaurant, a great oasis from Las Ramblas.",
