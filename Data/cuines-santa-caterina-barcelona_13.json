    "Really really good tapas and some of the best crema catalan in Barcelona. We ordered the mushroom ravioli, gnocci, ham, & all kinds of delicious appetizers. Gambas al ajillo were just ok, the only thing I wouldn't order again.Its literally connected to the same market and pretty close to the cathedral. Great place to walk to and enjoy Barcelona.",
