    "Cute wine bar in Barcelona that overlooks the Catalan Gothic church, Santa Maria del Mar.The wine list is very impressive, but the tapas were just so-so. The jamon iberica was on the tough side. Maybe it was just sliced too thick to chew? I also did not care for the tuna belly. I didn't realize the tuna was cured when I saw the dish on the menu. The dish reminded me of fancy canned tuna and cost 12 euros. The roasted vegetables were the only redeeming tapa. Prices are higher than other tapas bars, but expected since you are overlooking the gorgeous church.Come here for the wine and the view, but skip the food.",
