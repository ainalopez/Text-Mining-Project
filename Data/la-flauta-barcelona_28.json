    "Don't let the line deter you, this place is worth a long wait! Get a drink at the bar and chill. I have NEVER had better tapas. The fois was ridiculous and we couldn't believe how affordable our dinner was! The plates didn't come all at once and we were able to order as we went along. The waitress was amazingly helpful, as we couldn't choose between a few plates. I try to travel to Barcelona once a year and will ABSOLUTELY be back.",
