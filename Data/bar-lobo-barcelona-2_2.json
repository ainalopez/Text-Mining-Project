    "Spanish food is fantastic when it's good - this is one of those examples. Bar lobo truly delivers and I will tell you a good few reasons why.1. Outside you can lounge in the couches and have a pre-cocktail, people spot and just relax. It's comfy and welcoming.2. Ambience. Cool, roomy, light, contemporary mixed with Spanish. Yeah now I'm out of adjectives.3. The food. We went through a good few tapas, my favorite was the wild rice with mushroom sauce, the tuna, and the octopus. Do not miss the rice! I would never think rice could be this good until I tried it at Bar Lobo. For dessert, lemon tart and chocolate cake was a tie.Our waitress was attentive and friendly, patience it turned out as well as we asked for about a million extra orders (yeah crew was hungry). We paid around 35 Euro each and then we all had drinks and so much food we could have been rolling out the restaurant. A keeper!",
