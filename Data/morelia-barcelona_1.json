    "Had two lunches here and both occasions were wonderful. The service was efficient and friendly and the food was really delicious. We had pasta dishes, empanadas, and different salads on the two visits. Everything was simple but so flavorful. The ingredients are fresh and quality making for the most beautiful food. The icing on the cake and probably the most delicious dessert we ate on our 2 month stay in Barcelona, was the Morelia tiramisu. Get it! Not the traditional one, their special one with caramel. Wow! I hope to be back in Barcelona and will certainly come make a return visit to Morelia!",
