    "Good stuff. You gotta experience it. Great food, sexy waitress. Good good food. We also got a vermouth for free that was really good. It's one of those places with a not so interesting look from the outside, but once you get in, it has these wine barrels. The stools are made if them too. The food is very good, we ordered all the tapas on the menu because they were 4 Euros each. It was a good time.",
