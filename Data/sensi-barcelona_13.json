    "This place has great service, a nice ambiance, and even better tapas! My favorites were: the roasted pork ribs, salmon tartar & the sea bass trilogy. I saw that many other reviews raved about the duck timbale - I was not that impressed with this one. For desert, you have to go for the cheesecake!",
