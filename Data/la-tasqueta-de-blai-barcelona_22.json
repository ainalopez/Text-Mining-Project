    "Fun little bar with a great selection of pinxtos for $1 per. \u00a0No need to look at the menu, just take whatever looks good and the friendly waitress will tally the order at the end of your meal. \u00a0It's a little bit off the touristy path, so no need to worry about loud and obnoxious crowds.",
