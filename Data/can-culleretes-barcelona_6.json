    "SEAFOOD LOVERS ALERT! \u00a0This is the place for some REALLY good seafood at reasonable price. \u00a0We were a party of 2 and each ordered the seafood platter at 30 euros a pop. \u00a0WELL WORTH IT! \u00a0 Barcelona is known for seafood but they are not cheap. \u00a0But at 60 euro (for 2 people) we got ALOT of varieties of seafood. \u00a0The seafood platter actually came in 4 courses. \u00a0First we had a very VERY sizable portion of steamed mussels and clams. \u00a0Next came grilled shrimp scampi style. \u00a0The shrimp was sizzling in a light broth and was very tender and crunchy. \u00a0 We used the bread to soak up every drop of the flavorful broth. LOL! \u00a0Next came a fried battered plate of monkfish, shrimp, crayfish and calamari. \u00a0 Everything was good except I don't care much for the monkfish. \u00a0The final course was a charred/grilled medley of LOBSTER tail, jumbo crayfish, prawns and baby squids. \u00a0It was an awesome finale and everything has a nice smokey taste. \u00a0We ordered 1 liter of sangria at 7,50 euro. \u00a0By the time we finished, we were thoroughly enthralled by all the varieties and freshness of this awesome seafood platter! \u00a0You must get this if you love seafood!!!!!",
