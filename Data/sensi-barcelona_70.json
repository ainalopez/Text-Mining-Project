    "What a wonderful experience at Sensi awaited us last night. It is definitely my best tapas experience while in Barcelona. First of all, it's nice to be able to sit restaurant style while having tapas. Secondly, the service was friendly, English-capable, the portions were generous and the range of tapas options was extensive. The sangria was excellent for under 3 euros, and our server (young guy from Guatemala) was incredibly knowledgeable, engaging and even helpful on questions about the city. The space is cozy, warm and perfect for a Gotic Quarter experience. We enjoyed the chorizo in pepper sauce, the goat cheese salad and the mini seafood paella.",
