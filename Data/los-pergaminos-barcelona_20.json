    "Barcelona's Barri Gotic made me feel like an explorer, a kid at heart again. \u00a0The narrow, cobble-stoned streets and alleys that blend into one another and eventually into plazas teeming with life, make you want to throw away the map and revel in being lost. \u00a0Well, that is easy to do if you are a crazy American, who fails to bring a cell phone that has ex-US coverage or have limited minutes on your unlocked iPhone with pre-paid SIM card...Alas, my travel buddy, Rosa, and I found our winding and bewildered way to Los Pergaminos thanks to yelp.com. \u00a0We had tried going there on a Monday night after much walking. \u00a0We were exhausted and disappointed with our unsuccessful first attempt. \u00a0Yet, Rosa would not be thwarted. \u00a0She had read the rave yelp reviews, saw that it was family owned and operated with a warm and cozy ambiance and she was focused.We returned a few days later and to our surprise, they were open. \u00a0Our experience there, thanks to CLAUDIA, was the most amazing. \u00a0 She suggested a very solid red-wine pairing the first night and dishes that made our stomachs happy. \u00a0(please see the photos). \u00a0Claudia actually spoke to us in ENGLISH (thank you) with occasional small discussions in Spanish (thanks to all of my Spanish college professors and high school teachers!!!! Spanish has become my go-to language)I would highly recommend this place and my favorite was the dessert: \u00a0Crema Catalan. \u00a0DELICIOUS!You have to try the jamon iberico and pan con tomate. \u00a0 The paella...(we had the chicken and non-seafood one b/c of shellfish allergies) was delicious and I'm sure that the seafood one would be equally so. \u00a0To die for was the foie gras layered with goat cheese and topped with apple and caramelized sugar (yummmmers)We were so pleased that we returned again another evening. \u00a0The price is moderate, but tapa, family style sharing keeps prices rather reasonable. \u00a0I think that we ended up spending about $60 with wine for 2 people the first night and a little more the 2nd visit. \u00a0 Barcelona is definitely a city for all senses...so enjoy!!!!!!!",
