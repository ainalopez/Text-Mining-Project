    "Went here with a group of American friends. We ordered a couple bottles of wine, some provolone, and individual dishes. I had the Spanish steak, Argentinian-cut.It was delicious, and that's what matters most to me. Service wasn't stellar, and I was too hungry to notice the decor, but the meat was spot on, and the portions were huge. Paid approximately 14 euros for more food than I could eat. Would definitely go back again.",
