    "we loved Pim Pam burger! Very good quality burger and very affordable. Patties are made either of a beef/pork mix or of veal, and are very tasty....clearly Catalan meats are of a very good quality (not like American Monsanto meat). Fries are pretty good. The local beer was dreadful but they have other things to drink. Very small inside, but we always found a place to sit. And check out the bathrooms, they remind me of WC's on a sailboat.",
