    "Excellent pica-pica! \u00a0I love their assortment of Tapas. \u00a0Very conveniently located along Paseo del Born. \u00a0Very lively atmosphere \u00a0in the middle of the square. \u00a0Outside seating is a must. \u00a0Perfect for your weekend light hors d'oeuvre, small morsels of food to cover a wide range of dining. \u00a0We ordered tortilla de patatas, you just have to because its good. \u00a0Pescadito Frito, simply my favorite, botifarra trufada & jamon Iberico are the traditonal must have.The wait staff are friendly and helpful especially when you are confused on what to order from a long list of tapas choices. \u00a0Always pair your tapas with \"cava\" (Catalan sparkling wine) its my new favorite refreshing cold drink, goes well with your food, especially seafood.",
