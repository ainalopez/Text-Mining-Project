    "My lunch experience with Surya was mixed: \u00a0decent food, strong drinks, mediocre service, questionable bill. The food: \u00a0My vegetarian daal tasted fresh and looked beautiful but was extremely bland compared to the Indian food I've had elsewhere. I realize that they have a disclaimer on their menu stating that their food is not spicy, but this was still a disappointment. The drinks: \u00a0I ordered a gin and tonic, and the drink I received was nearly as large as my head and STRONG. The cocktail menu seemed exorbitantly overpriced but, given the size of the drinks, ended up being fairly reasonable. Also, my friend's Pink Lady was super delicious. The service: \u00a0Our waitress was pleasant enough and spoke perfect English, which was helpful because my Spanish is mediocre at best (and my Catalan is nonexistent.) The pace of service was very slow, but I've come to expect that in Barcelona. My biggest problem with Surya came when it was time to pay the bill. I'm studying abroad, and my school gifted my group with Cheque Gourmet vouchers for food. Upon entering Surya, we asked the hostess if they accepted Cheque Gourmet, showing her the physical vouchers to confirm that she understood exactly what we were asking. She told us they accepted them, so we sat down to eat. When we went to pay, however, the man at the register refused to take our vouchers. We explained that the hostess told us they were accepted, and he replied that she is new and was confused. I understand that mix ups happen, but we ended up with a very unexpectedly expensive lunch tab and nothing but a half hearted apology. We would have argued against paying the full tab had we not been pressed for time. This completely soured what could have been a lovely lunch.",
