    "This place is nice with a perfect ambiance for a romantic dinner. \u00a0The quality of the seafood is fresh but the reason why I give it 3 stars was due to the saltiness of all the food. \u00a0We tried the black noodle with cuttlefish, \u00a0black rice with cuttlefish, \u00a0meat paella, \u00a0seafood noddle, \u00a0and meat and vegetable paella. \u00a0On the contrary, \u00a0the cod fish and salmon was good.",
