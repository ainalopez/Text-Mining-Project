    "After waiting for an hour and a half, \u00a0and a dozen good yelp and trip advisor reviews, \u00a0I was expecting an amazing dish. \u00a0I'm Asian and I've eaten at a lot if good Japanese restaurant across the globe. \u00a0This just isn't one of them. \u00a0The fusion didn't work. \u00a0The tuna tataki with avocado just wasn't that fresh, \u00a0and the guacamole didn't match. \u00a0The burger was confused at best. \u00a0The miso \u00a0soup was interesting and the duck with foie \u00a0was pretty good. \u00a0Maybe fusion appeals to Europeans, \u00a0but this was average at best. \u00a0I was also totally underwhelmed by three of momofukus restaurants, \u00a0so you be your own judge",
