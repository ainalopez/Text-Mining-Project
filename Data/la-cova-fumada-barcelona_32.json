    "Amazing, delicious, completely local and authentic. Try bombas, artichokes, garbanzos and any seafood they have. I sat there with two friends, filled the table with small dishes and wine. Oh bliss! Even better the bill... so well priced! How I miss my \u00a0noisy Barcelona summer nights. Great stop after some time at the beach. enjoy!",
