    "This is a truly awesome restaurant with a classy Mediterranean setting. The dance club and lounge is in the front and dining restaurant is set further back. It's a great waterfront location . The foie gras, egg rolls are good. Tagine lamb, sushi sashimi platter, steak and duck dishes were all good. Wine list is exhaustive. Party vibe, lively. Highly recommend.",
