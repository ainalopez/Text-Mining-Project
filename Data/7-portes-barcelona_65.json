    "We ate here on our vacation. Listed in many sites as the best paella in barcelona. This is not even close. It's not terrible but I wouldn't say it's good either. Service is pretty good along with the sangria. \u00a0But prices are very expensive and over priced for what you get. I would not Return for sure. Seemed like a tourist trap to me. Most people in the restaurant were tourist from the cruise. Barcelona is full of amazing places to eat, better spend your money else where.",
