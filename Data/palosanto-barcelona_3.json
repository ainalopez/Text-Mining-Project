    "This is a cool place, but not so overly cool that you don't feel un-cool if you're not cool. \u00a0You know, Barca tapas cool. \u00a0Which is to say it's fun but not pretentious; the food is varied -- maybe that's what tapas means? -- and super-tasty. \u00a0I'm not big on sangria but I am big on their sangria. \u00a0Price is right, which is to say that it's cheap, especially for the quality of the food. \u00a0I'd go back.If I weren't stuck in Ashe County, NC.",
