    "My parents, husband, and I ate here in May 2015. \u00a0We had just toured La Pedrera and this casual restaurant is within walking distance. \u00a0When we walked in looking for lunch they were quite busy but they greeted us right away and we opted to sit in the bar area so that we could sit immediately. \u00a0As we sat down the manager visited our table and informed us that we had visited 'on a very special day' (a Tuesday). \u00a0They run a special with numerous different tapas to choose from at the bar, each has a toothpick in it. \u00a0Select as many as you want, server counts the toothpicks at the end. \u00a01 Euro per toothpick. \u00a0The casual tapas were good and this place was a fun experience.",
