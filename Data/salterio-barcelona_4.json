    "Amazing turkish coffee. They heat the pot on the gas stove while making it so the entire room fills up with cardamom and coffee when it's almost ready.On top of tea and coffee, I just really love the vibe here. Dimly lit and cozy. Perfect spot to enjoy the company of some of your favorite people. Also great place to people watch. Unlike a lot of coffee shops or tea rooms in the area, they're also open late so bonus points for that.",
