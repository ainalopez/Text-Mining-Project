    "This is where you go to spend all your Euros but get an absolute feast for 5 people in the process. We came here the first time while visiting Spain and vowed to return the next day it was so delicious. The cava (choice of sweet or regular....sweet is the way to go) is so cheap yet so yummy. The food is pretty good too, but really, the cava is so good.Full disclosure though, the place seemed to always be crowded. The first time we went we managed to claim a corner space where we had access to a counter to rest our drinks/food. But the 2nd time was the middle of the afternoon where they had specials on bottles of cava. The place was so packed we were reaching over other people to eat our food. Just beware there will constantly be arms around you trying to reach food/drinks. They don't let you take anything outside, so it all has to be kept inside. They also don't seem to have napkins, which was strange to me, but no one seemed to mind. Despite what may seem like chaos, the prices make it all worth it. And they get so many tourists now, that they can all speak English :)",
