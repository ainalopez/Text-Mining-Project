    "My absolute favorite bar in Barcelona. \u00a0Very young ambiance and crowd. \u00a0 Loved the different montaditos they have available. \u00a0It was so good I could hardly stop going for more. And yes, you won't know what you're biting into most of the time, but it will be delicious. When you go, don't seat at the bar, instead wait a few minutes for a table. Don't get discouraged, the place looks packed, but there is a lot of movement and you should find a place to sit fairly quick. Also, don't be afraid to share a table, it creates great opportunities to meet very interesting people from all over the world. \u00a0 By far the best tasting, less expensive place in Barcelona. \u00a0Take your time, meet some people and enjoy the great food.",
