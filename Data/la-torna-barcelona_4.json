    "When people talk about eating food prepared simply and enjoying each ingredient for what it is, La Torna does it just as well, if not better, than many others who claim to do the same.Tucked away in the Mercat Sta. Caterine, it is essentially bar seating surrounding an open kitchen of personable chefs adjoining a bakery that shares the same name. \u00a0Here you can see the food literally transformed before your eyes as baby squid is plucked from the ice, deftly seared and then presented in marvelous wonder dressed in just olive oil and sea salt. \u00a0The results are magnificent. \u00a0Tender and smoky, this dish envelopes your palate and introduces you to what squid should and is supposed to taste like. \u00a0Similar results are achived with the prawns (succulent and wildly flavourful) and wild mushroom dish (garnished with a lush fried egg), all of which I would unequivocally recommend.This is truly a no-frills place that might get overlooked because of its unruly location amd hectic demeanour, but their ability to source and handle incredible produce with a deft and subtle hand produces unexpected results I have seldom experienced elsewhere.",
