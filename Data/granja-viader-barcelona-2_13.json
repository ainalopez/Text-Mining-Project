    "The locals recommended this place for the infamous Spanish combo of churros and chocolate. In operation since the late 1800s, this place is like a step back in time with white shirt and bow tied waiters and a mix of locals as well as tourists. The chocolate was nice and thick, not overly sweet and the churros were fresh out of the fryer, so much so they were almost too hot to eat when they arrived at the table. If you go, beware of the traditional hours of 9 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. If you're looking for a late afternoon churro and chocolate break, you'll be out of luck.",
