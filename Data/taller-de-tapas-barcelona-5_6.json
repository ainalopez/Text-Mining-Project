    "We avoided this place for our first few days in Barcelona under the belief that it looked like part of an inpersonal chain of restaurants and therefore not as good as a more traditional tapas bar. However, we were wrong. We only had coffee and mussels, but they were the best mussels I have ever tasted - and I've got through a few in my time. We also had tomato bread which was delicious. The service was efficient and friendly and the choice of tapas at the bar was mouthwatering. To our delight the bill came to about \u00a35. I only wish we had found this earlier in our visit.",
