    "tiny little place... not enough seating...BUT THE BEST FALAFEL! \u00a0I go for the salad bowl, and ask for very little lettuce - that way i can pile on all the wonderful condiments/toppings available at that salad bar. \u00a0I almost like those better than the falafel. \u00a0no... scratch that - the falafels are great. Thank you for being open late when i'm starving after too many of those GinTonicas... so after a night of dancing & drinking, be sure you keep an extra 5 euros for Maoz. \u00a0*** full disclaimer - It's also just as wonderful when totally sober in the middle of the day.",
