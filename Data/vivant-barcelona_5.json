    "While my family was in town I was looking for a Spanish/tapas restaurant with style to give them an overview tapas.We randomly stumble-uponed Vivant, that just opened few months ago.It has a lot of choice for typical tapas. Bravas were amazing, with homemade sauce. Good pulpo a la gallega and pimentos del padron too.The atmosphere is very nice and cozy. Menus are available in English if needed.Seems like they also have a lunch menu.Definitively a good gem in the hood",
