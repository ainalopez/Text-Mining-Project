    "My fianc\u00e9 and I were looking for somewhere to eat near the Casa Batllo, and I found this gem on yelp. I am not a vegetarian, I'll start with that. I read some other reviews of how insanely delicious the sangria and food was so we decided to give it a try. We had a pitcher of sangria to start (19 euro) and it's only sold by the litre- SO WORTH IT. It's an orange fizzy delight with grapes and oranges diffusing into it. We each had 3.5 glasses- so price was reasonable once you look at it that way. We had healthy nachos to start- delicious. I ordered the pasta dish (papa-something), and he ordered the ravioli.",
