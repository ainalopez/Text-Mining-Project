    "Stopped by with an expat living in BCN. The Philharmonic feels like a familiar English pub. We just had drinks, but they have typical pub fare like burgers and chicken fingers. Very relaxed vibe and they were playing 80's music videos on the big screen, which was awesome!! Drinks were cheap. Less than 3 euro for a glass of wine.",
