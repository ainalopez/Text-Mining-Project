    "Arrrrrrrgh I hate to give 'em a three star rating. Don't get me wrong, it was a lovely meal, but I'm not sure if it was worth the price we paid.The place is set inside a hotel. It doesn't seem to be in the middle of Barcelona... we had to take a not-so-short taxi ride to get here. The place is lovely... there are staff everywhere, and they are very attentive. Very VERY attentive. It feels a bit strange to be catered to at that level to be honest -- it hasn't been that way with the other fine dining restaurants I've been to (not that I've been to a lot.)We ordered the 16 course dinner menu. Let me say this, every plate felt like a work of art. \"Exquisite\" would be the term I loved the different plates they used, and everything looked so delicate. I liked how they would prepare some of the meals at the table, including leaving the infusions to simmer.While I can't say that I was absolutely in love with everything that was served, the combinations of flavors and textures was all quite interesting.BUT! But... the reason why this gets an okay-ish three stars from me is the price. The 16 course meal costs 165 euros per person. While the food was all quite good and unique/interesting, I don't think there was anything about it that really stood out to me.",
