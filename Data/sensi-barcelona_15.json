    "Having read great reviews on Yelp we headed out to this tapas joint after a tiring day in Barcelona. First let me start off with the good part of our experience. We ordered 4 tapas and they were all delicious. We ordered 2 vegetarian ( truffle ravioli & saut\u00e9ed vegetable ) and 2 sea food ( thai fish and prawns) we thought the food was great. But what really upset us was the service. Firstly as we entered we were told we have a time limit on our stay there (8-9:30pm). The server said he would seat us in a minute so I asked for the direction to the restroom but he looked at me in hesitation before pointing out to the restroom. Then we asked for tap water , but we're supposed to know he can offer us only mineral bottled water. Then they finally charged us for cover + bread which we weren't told of before. Lastly if all this hasn't upset us enough , the server came and blindly asked us, putting us in an awkward situation if we wanted to add a tip. ( mind you it's not customary in Spain to leave a tip) Overall I would never revisit this place again. The servers need to start giving some respect to the different people they serve !!!",
