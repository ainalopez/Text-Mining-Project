    "Our goal was to try a few tapas while running around this amazing city.We entered Plaza Real and had the task of choosing one of the restaurants. I saw the array of fresh seafood on display at the entrance and had to eat there.Staff was great. The location in the plaza couldn't be beat. Beautiful fall day, enjoying our lunch on the outside terrace. Their Sangria was delicious. We got the Iberic ham tapa, Bread with tomato, Fried Potato Chips, and the Cigalas/langostine. The food was okay but nothing special. So we didn't order anything else.",
