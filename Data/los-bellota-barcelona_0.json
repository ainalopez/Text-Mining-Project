    "We stumbled upon this place after our 3rd attempt to eat at a restaurant near Sagrada Familia. Everything in the area was closing for siesta (it was around 4pm) and we were getting desperate.They seated us right a away and brought out this complimentary potato salad dish served with two pieces of toast. It was very very good. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, anchovies served over tomatoes with vinegar, chorizo in a red wine sauce, and a salad with manchego cheese, nuts, dried fruit and honey. We devoured everything. I was having straight up foodgasms with every bite. I'm so so happy that we found this place. I've had too many experiences where I was completely disappointed with a meal, especially near tourist sites of big cities. This was definitely a great find. Our tummies were very pleased. :)",
