    "Located just off the Passeig de Gracia, this downstairs tapas spot is a winner. We stopped in for lunch around noon and were the only ones in the restaurant. It began to get more crowded by the time we left. A good amount of seating, both at bar tables and at the bar itself. We largely ordered based upon pics in other Yelp reviews and were very happy with all of our choices. Service was attentive and prompt. Pleasant, but not especially warm. Mango/Passionfruit Drink: You will see the small bottles of different flavors sitting in ice on the bar. It was simply mango and passionfruit blended with yogurt. A cool and delicious treat. Bikini Sandwich: Rich and creamy. The saltiness of the ham worked perfectly with the black truffles. A must order. Foie Burger: A fairly small sandwich, but given it's richness (i.e., the foie), it's a shareable portion.Bombe: Fried on the outside, with potato and meat on the inside. Nice side dish. Potatas Bravas: French fries covered in mayo and spicy paprika sauce. Very addictive and delicious. Definitely shareable. Chocolate Dessert: From the Yelp pics, we thought this was going to be gelato. Nope. It is almost the consistency of a thick, somewhat dark, chocolate mousse. Served with olive oil, sea salt, and small wedge-shaped cookies, this was lick-the-plate (we didn't) good. They do a nice espresso too, which was a good accompaniment to the chocolate dessert. For \u20ac 48, we got full lunch and drinks (no alcohol). Definitely recommend stopping in.",
