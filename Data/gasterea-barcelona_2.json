    "Awesome Pinotxo bar! The space is limited and a lot of people just stand at the bar and order. They don't seem to put a limit or facilitate a reservation system. If you can get in, you can order! It worked out for us since many of the places we walked by didn't let us in because we didn't have a reservation. Barcelona's dinning scene can be quite busy around 9-11pm. Back to the Gasterea! They have many different things on the menu and many of them are quite cheap! Small portions are \u20ac1.9 and larger casseroles are \u20ac3.25. You can fill up your stomach on a \u20ac15 bill. A few recommendations: grilled prawn with artichokes and broken egg with ham. We didn't even get to try their veal and steak yet. Definitely worth another visit!",
