    "Very nice people, but I'm sorry to say only mediocre food. I've eaten at dozens (no exaggeration) of Japanese restaurants all over the planet (including Japan). Sushi was meh, teriyaki eel yuk, only one type of saki that was good hot but bad cold. Nice server but command of English very basic leading to some misunderstandings. Wish I could be more positive.",
