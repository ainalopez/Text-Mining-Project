    "Like many other places in Barca this place is a bit overrated. It's nice but they barely have seats (which seems to be typical here) and the pizza dough is more like bread and the overall taste wasn't overwhelming. The thing I did like a lot is that you can order the slices like tapas, it goes per weight. That's awesome. Employees are friendly and helpful to. If you are a real pizza lover you will probably be a bit disappointed. But it doesn't mean that the food here is bad.",
