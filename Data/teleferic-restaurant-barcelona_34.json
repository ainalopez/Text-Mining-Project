    "A modern cuisine take on tapas. It was like Catalan Dim Sum. \u00a0The dishes are laid out on a long bar and you take a plate and choose what you want. \u00a0The English-speaking staff heats up the hot dishes and brings them to your table. \u00a0In addition to traditional Catalan and Spanish dishes there were tiny tapas hamburgers and tiny tapas fajitas to name a couple. \u00a0The wine list was small but good and very good value.",
