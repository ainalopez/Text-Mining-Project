    "Simpu is a tasty Japanese place right off La Rambla in the touristy Barri Gothic. It's a great find considering all the restaurants trying to solicit your patronage in that neighborhood! The lunch menus are affordable and come with soup, salad and dessert. I must add that the udon noodle bowl is rather yummy. You can certainly find better and more authentic sushi places out there but I think this place is pretty good. The d\u00e9cor is cute and the location is small and quiet; it has a rather intimate atmosphere. It's a nice place to go if you have sampled all the various possibilities of croquetas and want a change of pace. :)",
