    "Lived in Barcelona for 5 months. Lucky for me I came across this hidden gem early in my stay. It's across from the beach! My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE go to spot. CHEAP but extremely fresh and plentiful. From their fresh baked bread to the crisp veggies and saut\u00e9ed on the spot chicken or hamburger. Salmon and feta!?! Yes! House made sauces! Or just make it an enormous salad for around the same price. Go! You won't be disappointed.",
