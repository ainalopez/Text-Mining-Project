    "I thought the tapas here were pretty good and the beer...well, all beer tastes the same to me so the beer was good, as well. The reason this place isn't a 4-5 star joint is that I think it's super overpriced. Almost 2 dollars per little tapa?? No, thank you. I'm pretty sure there's at least a 50% mark up there. The atmosphere and service were on point and we enjoyed the time here, but probably won't be returning anytime soon. :/",
