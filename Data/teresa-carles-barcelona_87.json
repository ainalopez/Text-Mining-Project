    "Dios mio! This place is amazing. \u00a0Breakfast/brunch, lunch, or dinner! (although vegan options are pretty limited on the breakfast front).I was withering away from lack of quality vegan proteins after staying around 4 days in Tarragona... My hunger was well sated with some of the most delicious tempeh I've ever tasted in the calabaza (pumpkin) and tempeh salad. \u00a0Hot damn, this was a delicious feast of flavors and textures! The pumpkin was perfectly roasted, the tempeh was perfectly seasoned and sauteed, and the greens were fresh and crisp. \u00a0Topped off with a cinnamon-tinged soy yogurt dressing and some pepitas?! Heaven, I tell you. \u00a0I also had a vegan spinach croquette as a little appetizer, and had to really restrain myself from getting 5 more. My dining companion thoroughly enjoyed her omlette and a tofu/cheese croquette, and we both indulged in a nice glass of cava with our brunch. \u00a0It's not cheap, but it's really not that pricey either, considering the quality. \u00a0This would be my #1 recommendation in BCN for the vegan/vegetarian traveler!",
