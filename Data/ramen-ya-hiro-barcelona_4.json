    "This was my first time eating ramen. I decided to go to this place because of all the excellent reviews I read about it. The local is really really small and it gets overcrowded easily so you have to wait in a long line in the street before getting a sit. I had to wait like one hour (not a joke) and it was a Thursday at 8.30pm, so I guess it would have been even more on a weekend. When we finally got to sit inside, I thought my dinner would not be very comfortable because all the tables were really close to each other and there was no space. Besides that, I was still excited to try a ramen bowl for the first time and even more at Ramen-Ya Hiro, because I have a Japanese friend who says this is the real ramen you can eat if you go to Japan. I have to say that the noodles and all the toppings were really flavorful and I liked it pretty much. So, the three stars go to the food, which actually deserves five, but I cannot give the highest rate to this place because I did not really like the ambiance inside the restaurant. Plus the waiters might be so stressed that they forgot one appetizer and I felt a little stressed too in some way.",
