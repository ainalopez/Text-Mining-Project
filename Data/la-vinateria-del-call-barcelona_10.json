    "One of the best places to eat and drink in all of Barcelona.Order a maximum of two dishes per person unless you are seriously hungry.The octopus is properly cooked, the croquetas de jamon just melt in the mouth, the morcilla de arroz is perfect and the pimientos de Padron have been turned down to keep the locals happy, ie no shockers.The wine list is well balanced and not expensive compared to places closer to the Ramblas.Has been open for over 20 years under the same ownership and hopefully won't change.",
