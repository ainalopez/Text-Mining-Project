    "Very tasty, efficient place to have lunch in the Eixample in between visits to the Gaud\u00ed sites like La Pedrera or Casa Battl\u00f3! I read about this place in a Rick Steves guide to Barcelona, and we were glad we heeded his advice.We stopped in here on a rainy day around 14:00 and enjoyed their straightforward prix-fixe lunch menu, with a couple of choices for each course. Both of us started with the fideua, which was an extremely flavorful, delicious noodle dish with seafood. For my main dish, I ordered the steak and fries while my boyfriend opted for rabbit, which was also served with fries. The prix-fixe included a drink and dessert, so we both ordered a ca\u00f1a (local draft beer) and flan. Service was prompt and friendly, although I was very glad to know passable Spanish for ordering food, since it seemed like our server didn't know any English (which is of course fine). Overall, a great value.",
