    "After 4 days of being less than impressed by the food in Spain, we found Sensi Bistro. Not only was this the best meal we had in Spain, it's one of the best I've ever had. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, and our 6 tapas choices were perfectly timed. Sadly, the best came last and we were too full to enjoy. They suggest 2-3 plates per person, and we were surprised by how large the portions were. For the 2 of us, we spent \u00a363 on a bottle of wine and 6 tapas. We would have easily spent double that on a similar meal in the U.S. (And the quality would not have been as good). We would be going back tonight if we hadn't discovered that there are two other Sensi restaurants to try!",
