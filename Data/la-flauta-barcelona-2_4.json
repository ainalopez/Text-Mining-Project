    "We came here thinking it was the original La Flauta (close by), but were confused- this is what they have called \"La Flauta II\". We came in at sat ourselves at around 3:30pm for an afternoon meal at the bar. \u00a0Service was quick. We had 3 tapas and a few coffees. Noticed that many people around us came in for a quick meal- a sandwich (4-5\u20ac) and a wine. We didn't have any wine but it looked like the people around us enjoyed it. \u00a0Everything is priced well, but we thought the food was okay... I'm not even sure I would recommend this place based on what we ate. \u00a0We did have the egg/potato concoction. It was fine. \u00a0Nothing extravagant. \u00a0In fact, I wish we had just a simple sandwich or other tapa item instead. \u00a0The coffees we had were delicious, though... Really good stuff and at a good price 1.2\u20ac. If we had more time here, I believe I would give it another shot. \u00a0The next time, I would just go in for a simple sandwich and coffee.",
