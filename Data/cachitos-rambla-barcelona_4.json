    "The food is extremely tasty, but unfortunately not enough. We ordered paella for 2 people (18,50 per person) and one tallarine made of zucchini with sepia and shrimps. All of them were extremely delicious but really small portion, specially for for the price. The paella for two people is the same quality as the one for one person in other restaurants and the tallarine looked like a portion of tapas. Well, I'm not sure if I would go again, it's too expensive to leave the restaurant feeling hungry. But if you're going, take the crema catalana also, it's amazing!",
