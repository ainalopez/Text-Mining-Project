    "I've only had breakfast to go but the waiter was really nice and the place looks amazing.I had a green juice (very well balanced and tasty) and a vegan croissant (they open it, toast it as serve it with vegan butter and jam). The croissant was good even if not the best. Definitely does the trick though for us vegans ;)Their menu looks on point and I'm gonna try to come back for lunch.",
