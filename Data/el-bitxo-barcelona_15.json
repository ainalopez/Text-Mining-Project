    "During my two weeks in Spain this was #1. The owner is super nice and talked with us for over an hour. \u00a0If you want to break away from the mandatory Spanish dishes and go with something original this is the place for you. \u00a0It is an intimate venue with a dynamic venue. I am all for original experiences but this is a repeat. We also got recommendations for the rest of the trip at dessert.",
