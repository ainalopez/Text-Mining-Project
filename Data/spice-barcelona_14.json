    "The best carrot cake I've ever had. \u00a0My wife doesn't even like carrot cake and she fought me for the last bite. \u00a0That should tell you something! \u00a0The cake had the right balance of icing, perfect density, and not overdone on the carrots or raisins. \u00a0Just perfect. \u00a0It's a cozy little shop with a few tables and two very friendly owners. \u00a0It didn't hurt that they spoke perfect English either! \u00a0The cake variety changes daily, but the carrot is their specialty. \u00a0Give it a try with a nice espresso and remember that if you are lucky enough to live in Barcelona, it doesn't have to be your last piece!",
