    "We arrived cordially on time at 2pm. The first part of the service was excellent and we felt very welcomed and looked after, until our waitress was called to serve the other area. The gaps between meals become longer and longer, the introduction of the courses before lackadaisical, they even ended up missing a course. Water was not filled and when I did ask some stupid girl fill my glass to the full and gave one drop to my other guest. It took 3 attempts for the bill to come and the sour-faced maitre 'd did not even thank us. I would expect after spending more than 450 euro on lunch in Barcelona, that's the least you can do. A smile and a thank you!. It was a 4 hour dinner when it should have been 3, even after we paid our coats were not returned to us,e had to chase them down. Dear Disfrutar, I don't care if you are an undeserving michelin star restaurant, if you have incompetent people working the floor, then you are only a kitchen selling wannabe food with unsatisfying experience. I spent the first 2,5 hours of the meal planning to come back but you managed to ruin everything by the last 90mins of service when it should only have taken 30 mins. Dear Disfrutar, no disfruto NADA!",
