    "A great place for 2-4 people, with everyone sharing different dishes. We were 4 people, and started with humus and other dips. Then moved on some meat dishes. All of which was shared and served with pita bread. The staff are great ( and speak decent English if you need). There is a sister place just up the road, so if you don't fit in this one, just head to the other.",
