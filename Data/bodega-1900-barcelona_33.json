    "Unbelievable! Best tapas I had in Spain. \u00a0The staff was great as they recommended several things. \u00a0The exploding olives, the ham croquettes, anchovies, pigs neck sandwich with asian inspired Aioli sauce. \u00a0They had a drink similar to sangria but was called something else - either way it was brilliant. \u00a0If you're in Barcelona go here",
