    "I havent had a good burger since living in Spain. I really miss a good burger but am not will to try just anywhere. As we walked past this place on our way to the cable car, the smells are what drew us in. The smells were too good to pass up. Prices looked reasonable and there was a free table!! We all got a burger and ordered 2 things of fries for 4 people. The buns for the burgers were very crusty and a little hard to eat, but overall it was a great meal. The fries werent what you will find all over the city. They are not those bright yellow fries. These were really good. Very similar to what I could get somewhere back home. I wouldnt recommend this place to an American since you can get this back home easily but if you are from elsewhere and havent had anything better than a Burger King burger, check this place out!! In total 2 beers, 4 burgers and 2 fries cost us 43 euros. Totally worth it for me.",
