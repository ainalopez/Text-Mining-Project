    "I think I must be seeing things through rose colored glasses because everywhere I go looks pretty awesome (and the Spaniards seem only half-enthused). However, I think I'm valid in my points when it comes to this place. Beautiful decor with mercury glass mirrors everywhere, huge old doors propped up against the wall and flowers galore. We sat by the window to people- and dog-watch (P.S. the dog-watching in Barcelona is top notch - there are some very independent and proud pooches here). After uncorking a great bottle of local wine and settling in with some starters, we discovered this place had excellent music (by the way, most music you hear in Europe is American). After tender salmon, soft mashed potatoes, and perfectly grilled asparagus, I overenthusiastically ordered the cheesecake, thus revealing my tourist-ness. Damn. Don't plan on eating when Americans do...this place doesn't even open until 8:30 PM. And it didn't get crowded until 10:00 PM. That's just the way they do it Spain. They're better.",
