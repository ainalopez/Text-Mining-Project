    "I found this place here at Yelp and I have to say that it is exactly as described.Very nice atmosphere, cosy and private and the host is so kind! He is very passionate about that restaurant, that's for sure.We've been there a little too early, around 11:30 so the menu wasn't ready, but we were offered mushroom carpaccio which was very good. It is located quite far from the touristic areas but it's worth it to take a short walk off the track.",
