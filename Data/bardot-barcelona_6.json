    "Did not expect such a fancy ambiance, but the food was good. The cheese platter came with a variety of Spanish cheeses, leading me to wonder where can I find the blue cheese that the restaurant served. The calamari were also tasty, but over breaded. For an entree my mom and I shared the burutta with salmon. It was good, but not great. Food came out on time and we were well taken care of. What more could you ask for?",
