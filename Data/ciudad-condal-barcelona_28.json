    "Simply the nicest tapas I've ever had. In fact, one of the nicest meals out I've ever had. The only drawback is that you're with a bunch of other tourists and the staff have a bit of an attitude but they could probably have insulted me and I would still have given it 5/5. Be prepared to wait for a table, or wait for a bar stool.I had the seafood salad, grilled cuttlefish and prawns. No drink. Came to about \u20ac20.",
