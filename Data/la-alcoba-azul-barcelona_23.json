    "Tiny bar that's very charming. Small likelihood of stumbling across this place, tucked away in a small gothic square and gloomy to look in to. Don't be put off though! Had some spectacular sangria. Upon declining tapas following an earlier indulgence, a taster plate was still provided. Tasty!",
