    "Arrived just as kitchen was opening for the evening and the owners took care of us with drinks and papadums with tasty chutney and yoghurt & mint dip until ready to take our orders. Rogan josh, aloo ghobi & chicken tikka all very good. Lamb biriyani was a bit soggy for my liking, but still tasty. Overall, friendly, prompt service, and good food in unpretentious surroundings.",
