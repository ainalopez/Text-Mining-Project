    "Absolutely my favorite meal in Barcelona. I'd return just to order another plate of tomato bread. It's not a complicated dish and nearly every restaurant serves it. But the bread Arenal used, they way they grilled it and served it with good olive oil and flaked sea salt made tomato bread very, very memorable. But there's more! The sangria was the BEST in Barcelona (ad we tried a lot!). The red sangria was perfect - full of triple sec and fruit, not at all watered down with soda or juice! The house olives were addictive. Olives brined with hot peppers, pickles and carrots - delicious. The paella was wonderful. Flavorful but not salty rice full of seafood. Their dish even included small scallops and diced calamari mixed with the rice. The shellfish was fresh and tender. The grilled razor clams were a little sandy but so yummy in their garlic sauce, we barely cared. And the cod fritters came with a tomato jam that really added so much to the fried fish. I loved that Arenal took every dish and added something to it to make it different, more delicious, and memorable. As for location, you can't get much better. Tables are set up right next to the sand. If you get a table along the edge, you can keep one foot on the beach. They shade tables during the day and turn on heaters at night. The only downside is that Arenal is not open on Sundays. We tried to eat here for a third (and last) time during the trip and were SO disappointed it was closed. The other place we tried couldn't compare.",
