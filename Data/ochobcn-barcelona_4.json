    "Really fun spot. High quality meat done very well for ~casual prices; the grilled vegetable side was also really well made with good olive oil and seasoning. Chill atmosphere, looks like a local joint. I don't know why it's billed as a hamburger joint on yelp, it's more of an Argentinian grill. The secreto pork and Argentinian t-bone were great (you order by the 100/200 grams so you can try different meats). The nice gentleman grilling the meats is right by the bar. Well worth a visit.",
