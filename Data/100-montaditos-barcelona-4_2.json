    "Wednesdays everything is just \u20ac1. What a great deal!The montaditos are great and such a good deal. There are also plenty of other other options for food and drink including salads and fries. Beer and shots are also very affordable.This is a great deal for anyone looking for a cheap bite to eat. There are many locations around the city and the outdoor patio seating is great for people watching and enjoying a beer!I cannot wait for these to become more popular in the US",
