    "Love the space, food was delicious, coffee was tasty, and staff were very nice. Great location too, not too crazy busy area, but still plugged in. \u00a0Reasonable prices along with veggie and meat options, so my wife and I were happy here, would absolutely return and recommend ;) only complaint is the staff can sometimes be slow, forgetting coffee order and check when we were ready to leave, had to remind a few times which isn't ideal.",
