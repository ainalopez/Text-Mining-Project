    "Our first night in Barcelona, we stopped here for dinner. They have live piano music to set the mood. My husband had the Rich Man's Paella (I tried some of it too) and he loved it. I tried the black rice, which was amazing! If you order black rice don't be put off by how it looks (resembles a burned dish) it is really tasty. We also ordered a bottle of wine: a Cabernet-tempernillo blend that complemented the meat beautifully. We over- ordered on dessert. The pijama I ordered was a huge plate of ice cream, flan, and fruit. The pijama is a dish meant to split. My husband ordered the grape sorbet with raisins: neither of us were impressed with the grape sorbet. I would definitely recommend this place for its paella and the atmosphere.",
