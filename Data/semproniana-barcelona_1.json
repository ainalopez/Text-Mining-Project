    "I had the privilege of having lunch at this amazing restaurant in Barcelona! \u00a0I have never seen anything like it.The ambiance was full of art and culture. The decor very imaginative with refine dishes that will satisfy your appetite. Desert lovers watch out because there are so many divine deserts to choose from. I completely fell in love with Semproniana because of the \u00a0delicious food, flawless service and exquisite decor. In addition, \u00a0it offered amazing gluten free dishes and deserts for \u00a0people with Celiac. Eating here felt like I walked into heaven. Walking in here is like walking into heaven for those who appreciate good food. Semproniana was so charming and enjoyable for us. The service was impeccable with so much grace. \u00a0It's truly a gem where the locals eat out in Spain. If I lived in Spain, I believe this is where \"I would take my guest \u00a0for lunch or dinner\". Semproniana is simply outstanding.",
