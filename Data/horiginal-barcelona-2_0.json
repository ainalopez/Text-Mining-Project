    "We happened upon Horiginal while wandering El Raval, when many places were packed full, this is one place we could get in. Service was good. Food was good. We had gin & tonics, paella, salad and bravas. We sat inside, there seemed to be quite a crowd sitting outside, but we really preferred the more intimate environment inside.",
