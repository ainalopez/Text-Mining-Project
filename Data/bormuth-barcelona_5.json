    "When in Barcelona, do as the Catalans do...and drink Vermouth. Drink it at Bormuth while eating Tapas. We stayed in Barcelona for 3 days and ate at Bormuth 2 times. FYI, the second time was only because most other places we had bookmarked were closed on Monday--a common thing in Spain. So instead of going to all the super touristy spots in the Born neighborhood, we returned to Bormuth to continue our conquest of the menu. What we had: Fried Eggplant Chips w/Honey (blown away by these), Fresh Lentil Salad (so refreshing and packed with flavor), Ensaladilla Rusa (because of course), Fried Calamari (oh my tender and perfect), Lomo in an Adobo Sauce (Lomo was a touch dry), & Albondigas (solid with plenty of sauce for bread dippage). And of course some drinks to wash it all down with. Definitely recommend the Vermouth at some point, either White or Red...your call. Everything was great here, including the service. We actually found everyone in Barcelona to be very friendly and helpful.",
