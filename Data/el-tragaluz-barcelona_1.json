    "El Tragaluz is a nice character restaurant on a quiet side street that is handy if you are visiting Gaudi's buildings. The restaurant is on the second floor with glass panels that allow the sun in. You walk past the kitchen on your way to the dining room. The last time we were here my wife regretted not ordering the Iberico ham. This time we corrected the error and had some amazing Iberico ham and procecco. The service was very attentive pleasant. Our glasses never got close to empty before a server refilled them.",
