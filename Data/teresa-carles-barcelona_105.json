    "Amazing vegetarian food! The location is cute, the staff is super friendly (and mostly fluent in English) and it has an upbeat vibe. The menu has an array of salads and fresh squeezed juice which provides a nice break from all the bread and cheese that is common vegetarian fare in Europe. Yum!",
