    "Such a cool decor, a complete different set-up for a typical caf\u00e9. They do have WiFi and I saw a group of students with their laptops. However the majority of the customers come with their little ones, the kids love the big trees, giant mushrooms and the designs on the wall. I like their tea and the carrot cake was delicious.",
