    "Brunch and Cake is a great spot for brunch. They have a Mexican and Spanish inspired menu that does a brilliant job of catering to carnivores and herbivores equally well. There are lots of non-meat options here, as well as some tasty (the turkey sandwich) choices. They also offer mimosas, good coffee, and other such brunch-time drinks.Brunch and Cake does not take special requests. This is one thing that is a bit baffling. By requests, I mean they won't substitute ham for turkey on the turkey sandwich, for example.This restaurant has above average service, as well as nice space for sitting outside. They do add a 10% premium for outdoor seats.",
