    "I was very impressed. I ran into a couple other Americans in the hotel around the corner, and decided to join them for dinner. I was happy to see that someone had come just the night before, so a Yelp review was fresh. I had the seafood paella which was delicious. Also sampled the potatoes, that were great, the sour cream sauce made the dish.I would definitely recommend this location.",
