    "Tosca was super close to my air bnb apt and the Palau de musica. I thought it would be too touristy but we went and tried it at 11:30pm on a Wednesday and it was quiet and delightful! The prices were great for the quality of food. Excellent cafe con leche, jamon, ensalada de queso de cabra, Gambia were damn good and the cava was \u20ac2.50 a glass! Great staff too. Probably will go there for a third time!",
