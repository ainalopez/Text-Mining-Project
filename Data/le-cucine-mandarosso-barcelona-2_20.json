    "An Italian friend of mine actually recommended this place to me telling me that the food in this cosy restaurant is better than what his mum serves him at home. Yeah, that is what he said. The atmosphere in this small restaurant is warm and welcoming. In both rooms an original look is created through the Italian specialities placed all over the restaurant, a huge rack storing pasta and wine bottles and a couple of different lamps placed on the shelves and the small wooden or marble tables. The service is taken care of by a young Italian team that is really supporting you making a choice when the variety of mouth-watering dishes becomes to diverse. Saving the best for last: The food is simple, unpretentious and so delicious. From the antipasti to the desert, this was a delight. My favourite as of now will be the ricotta-pear tartelettes (which I would recommend to share at least between two).",
