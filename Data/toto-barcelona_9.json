    "Fabulous Dinner!!! I had the delicious tasting menu and highly recommend it! \u00a0I couldn't finish each plate, but definitely save room for a tasting of each and the apple pie in the end. \u00a0Service was great as well. \u00a0My favorite was the fig salad which was the first part of the tasting menu. \u00a0Would definitely come back on my next visit to Barcelona.",
