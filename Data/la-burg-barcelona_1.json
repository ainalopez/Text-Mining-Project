    "Note: a milkshake is not a batido. A milkshake has ice cream in it. What is served here is milk with some powder additive and a sprinkle of nutmeg. Even just regular chocolate milk would taste better. Spend your \u20ac4.5 on something else.Also, don't try to eat outside, the traffic noise is defening.Pros: staff was nice and reactive.Cons: burger meat not good. Not cooked to order. Served with cold burnt curl of bacon. Expensive for what it is. Fries mushy and unremarkable. Only 2 beers on tap (mahou and alhambre)",
