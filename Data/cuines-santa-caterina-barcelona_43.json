    "Sat at the bar as it was a bit crowded but I think you would get quicker service here anyway. This place is really busy with not enough waiters. Fresh produce is evident. Yummy mozzarella & tomato salad, Iberian cured ham and Cantonese fried rice. Avoid the gazpacho and definitely stay away from the garlic shrimp, it's not what you think. They were large pieces of shrimp that tasted equally as fishy as it smelled. It really left a bad taste in our mouths. The desserts looked great, especially the cheesecake, although we didn't get any.",
