    "I was really excited to try this place. The night we went, the menu had nothing on it that had been reviewed or I had seen here on yelp, in fact there were only two entrees to choose from, neither of which I wanted. So we shared a starter, burrata con pisto, which was excellent, and then I had another starter for dinner, ceps del bosque, which featured a few mushrooms and chestnuts, and some weird green spongy stuff that I still don't know what it is. Not much food on that plate. My BF had pasta with seafood, which was...meh, good but nothing special. We went for it and tried a very strange dessert that was like a paste of berenjena (eggplant) with nuts stacked between biscuits, chocolate sauce, \u00a0and salted risotto ice cream. The ice cream was the worst dessert I've ever experienced-overpoweringly salty and just awful. Overall not much flavor, but I like very sweet desserts. This would be appropriate for someone who doesn't like sweets. Overall disappointed with the food, because my hopes were so high. Service was excellent.",
