    "I was able to score a reservation through ChowHound! They have a whole forum just on waitlist and reservations and I just posted if anyone was unable to keep their reservation to contact me and I was lucky enough to have someone give me theirs. Tickets is one of those places I do not think you could eat at often, but the experience is a MUST! We had the watermelon impregnanted with sangria, the olives (of course), the air pastries with cheese, a tuna dish, the cheese ravioli, the most amazing mini sandwiches that had ham and cheese and the bread it was on was sweet and just delicious and I think a few more items I cannot remember the names. We ended with The Living Forest for dessert. If you are in Barcelona... make your way here. You will not regret it, I will always remember my trip to Tickets!",
