    "I've been craving true socal/mexican restaurant for weeks now. This place is the perfect combination of true mexican food (the carnitas in super carne actually taste homemade instead of dry) combined with chipotle which normally I hate but for some reason I couldn't get enough of it here. If there is a better mexican joint around here I will find it otherwise this place it awesome.",
