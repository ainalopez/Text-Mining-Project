    "Really good tapas, been for tapas a few times now and I'd say this is the best and they charge accordingly. Spent \u20ac43 on one small beer, one medium beer, 3 oysters, potatoes with aioli foam, olives, bread with tomato, tapaella, and cured meat with cheese, and a Catalonia creme brule. All very delicious, but not a lot of food for the price. However it's right on la rambla, so the price is to be expected. Would go back.",
