    "This was the place we chose for our last meal during our Spain trip.We arrived a bit after 8:30 PM and there was already a wait of 4-5 groups ahead of us. This place is recommended by Michelin (no star yet) so we weren't too surprised. Fortunately our wait was only around 15 minutesWe were seated by the bar. The bartender was very friendly and took good care of us. The menu is composed of \"raciones\" (I would say twice the amount of a tapa dish) and full sized entrees. We decided on pan con tomate (amazing), Padron peppers (roasted to a light char which took some of the bitterness away), wild mushrooms with garlic (pricey for 10 euros but tasty), octopus with candied onions (more of a stew), baked scallops (a bit tiny but packing a punch of flavor), and bombas (2 huge meatballs with a spicy sauce). We chased these down with their draft beer (which wasn't Spanish beer but there you go). Paco Meralgo hit a lot of good notes in a refined (but not snobby) environment. By the time we left around 10 PM the wait was long so come early or call ahead for reservations",
