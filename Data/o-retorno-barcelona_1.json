    "\"It's not fancy...\" said our cab driver, after I asked him his fave place to eat in Barcelona. O'Retorno is apparently where all the cabbies like to eat. We got our hotel to make a booking for 9PM (we're finally getting into the swing of this late dining the locals do) and when we got there, we were told the little covered outdoor patio seating was \"complet\" - as in booked out.But we had a reservation? The never wrote our name down. No problem - they seated us in the narrow , brightly lit interior section, next to the bar. \u00a0 We had been advised to order the half portions - make sure you do that! We got a large place of the tomato-rubbed baguette (cold) and then an order of octopus. Mixed salad came with canned tuna. Huge. The brimming plate of octopus came out within 2 minutes - no exaggeration (they use microwave ovens) and it was absolutely tender, tasty and super delicious. Mounds of chunks of octopus on top of soft (overcooked but yummy) potatoes, all sprinkled with paprika. We also polished off a bottle of the only white wine they offered, which was fantastic.As soon as I saw that \"half\" plate of octopus, I immediately canceled my half order of prawns. Would not have made a dint in it...Best part? The entire meal cost E40. Super no-frills experience - great if you want a cheap meal after some of the more fancy places.And when we left - that patio was jam packed with locals. \u00a0Great place - try it - but don't expect fine food - just cheap & tasty fare and lots of it.",
