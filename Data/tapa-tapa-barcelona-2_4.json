    "Found on one of the busier streets... Ambiance is nice ans modern and seems fun. Servers are nice but can be forgetful at times. Also may misunderstand the order.... if you sit at the bar you can see all the action.The sangria was good, but it is made with Fanta. They pour bottles into it!The calamari is good. Good texture. The croquets was ok. The meat plate is ok. The desserts are basically all the same price. A little on the high side for what you get... the creme brule was ok. Prices are a little high because of the area its in, so it's understandable. \u00a0However be careful and check your bill thoroughly. There might be some extras that you never ordered on there... the servers were understanding and did take it off...All in all an ok experience.",
