    "Two weeks in Spain, three meals a day.. this was one of the maybe 4ish good places that I visited. BF and I ate there twice. I went with the seafood paella as everyone suggested and omg it was bomby! Ordered the fish platter the second time and didn't think it was that great. I unfortunately can't remember what it's called but my dude had the corrasche/corracha both times. It was steak and potatoes.. on the first page of the menu. Service was great both times(=",
