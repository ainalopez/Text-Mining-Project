    "We came in here when hungry during a day exploring and shopping. We walked up and the menu looked good and the place looked busy - so we decided yes - lunch here. We spoke to the manager, asking how long the wait would be, he said one minute. After waiting about 15, we asked the hostest again, and she said sorry no one added your name to the list - so it will be at least another 20. There was no apology or offer of anything - we decided to see if we could find another place to eat. We didn't see anything else nearby, so we came back only to be told it would another 20 minutes and then to wait nearly 35 for a table. The food was ok - good, but not exceptional and the service inside was good. Menu looks great but there are better tapas places. We won't be back here.",
