    "Probably the most stylish hostel bar I've ever been in. Cheap drinks and specials every day: 2 for one beers and vodka's type deals. Good American style restaurant food: wings, burgers, nachos fries, etc. Pool tables and lots of tv's. TV's were all showing american football while we were there so if you need to watch a game on ESPN America, this is a great spot. Lots of young travelers and a fun environment. Overall, just a great bar/restaurant when you're looking for a break from Tapas and need some good 'ol american style food to remind you of home.",
