    "I went there with my wife after checking Yelp and what was the best option near us, this time it was La Pepita, it was soooo crowded and busy, the guy on the door was friendly, he the wrote our name to be on the list, when you are a couple it's easier to get a table in busy place then a group. We had to eat on the bar but the chairs were comfy and good. Service was good and good was very good.",
