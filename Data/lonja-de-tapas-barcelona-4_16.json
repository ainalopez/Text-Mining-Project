    "Our favorite tapas spot in Barcelona. We had an incredible lunch, the menu of the day is 3 courses for 9.95 euros, and worth it!We started with langostinos, then the was the hamburgesa con fois gras, and finally the chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. \u00a0Everything was extremely tasty!We brought the kids, and they had chicken skewers, sardine bites, and patates. \u00a0They ate everything, including our desserts.5 of us for lunch and a bottle of wine, $60 euros.",
