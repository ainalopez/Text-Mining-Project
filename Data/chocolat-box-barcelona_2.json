    "If you can't tell, I have a sweet tooth. Though I'm allergic to milk, this place really hits the spot. Sadly, they usually only have one kind of sorbet made, but I don't mind. They have tons of other pastries and sweet delicacies to choose from. They also make smoothies, and milk shakes. I love coming here after lunch for some orxcata and a slice of cake.",
