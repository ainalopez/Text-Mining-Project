    "Staff was friendly and stopped me from ordering more fearing I had overordered. \u00a0They don't know my appetite, but it was nice of him. I subsequently did order another item....then one more. Hehe.Like I said earlier, English friendly staff. Yummy food. I skipped the long lineup inside by eating outside on the street tables. Win for me!",
