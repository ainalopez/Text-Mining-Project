    "This may not be the best Tapa bar in BCN but the food is good and it is an easy introduction into the Basque Tapa culture. Also being located only a block off the Ramblas it is very easy to find.NOTE: DO NOT EAT ON THE RAMBLAS it's crappy tourist food, overpriced and underwhelming.Irati can be intimidating because it is normally very busy to the point of overflowing. lt's not unusual to find customers leaning up against the church across the street while they eat and drink.Here's how you do it.1. Get as close to the bar as you can.2. Catch the bartenders attention...easier than it seems.3. Tell the bartender how many Platos (plates) you want and how many wines (tinto or blanco) or beers (canya).Example: Dos platos y una tinto y una canya por favor. (Two plates and one red wine and one beer please)4. Take the drinks and plates.5. Cruise the length of the self-service bar and pick out which pinchos (tapa) you want. Don't worry about reaching around or over other patrons they expect it and do the same.6. Find a place to stand or sit (you may have to go outside) and consume.7. Repeat.When you have had as much fun as you can stand take your plates back to the bar and hand them to the bartender. He will ask you how many drinks you had and then count the toothpicks that the pinchos were skewered with. This is how he totals up the bill.Under no circumstances throw away a toothpick. It's just not done.Natives do a Tapas crawl and hit several joints in an evening sampling what they like from each bar and drink their way around town.For the tourist it's not a bad way to get acquainted with the city.",
