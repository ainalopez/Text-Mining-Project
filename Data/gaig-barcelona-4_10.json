    "Happened upon this wonderful restaurant via searching Yelp reviews. Have to say this place overwhelmed with their cuisine and our day of touristic activities was only heightened with such a fantastic lunch! We felt a tad underdressed as the crowd was a smartly dressed business bunch..but the food...fantastico!!",
