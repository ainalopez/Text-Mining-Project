    "Maybe not as cool & trendy as its sister restaurant Cerveceria Catalana but hits the spot with its delicious selection of tapas & montaditos.We sat at the bar instead of waiting to be seated, which was great as we got to pick and choose what we wanted to eat - slightly dangerous as everything looks delicious!Definitely recommended as top places to visit in Barcelona.",
