    "Oh. My. God. This is such a delicious coffee shop. Right when we walked in I was so impressed with the layout and the owner was soo friendly! We ordered a cappucino, a chai, an Oreo cookie, two bagels, and the coffee cake. Which was AMAZING! Anyone that visits barcelona must come here! The only thing wrong with this place is the fact that I can't live there. Seattle approved!",
