    "We actually ate at La Esquinita which appears is the sister restaurant across the street from La Tasqueta de Blai which the kitchens may be shared.In the El Poble-Sec neighborhood is a small bar and tapas joint that has tables out in the pedestrian area. It was the end of February and in the low 60's so we were very comfortable sitting out there, but many locals were not. I went with my normal drink of choice in Barcelona, which is a Gin & Tonic. While Shelly ordered a hand-made Sangria. Both drinks were refreshing after walking around most of the day.Then, like most places I dove right into the tapas. Shelly and I split a total of 6 tapas - a nice late afternoon snack.We enjoyed : cream cheese and salmon covered in balsamic, a pureed potato mix with sesame seeds on top, spicy salami with a pepper, turkey with fresh mozzarella and paprika, jamon with gouda, and a spicy sausage all were on top of a slice of baguette.These were all really good.Besides all of the great drink and food, we were able to people watch since we were in the middle of a pedestrian street. Also, there was free wi-fi available so we could get in touch with family and friends.For more information and pictures check out our site : thegreatcubeescape.com",
