    "LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Disclaimer: I am a non-vegan/non-vegetarian but I am friends with people who are, thus, I try out all the places they recommend.The burgers, fries and hummus are excellent! I will definitely eat here again.Also, probably the best place I've seen with craft beer in Barcelona in the 9+ months I've been living here. Prices are more to American standards for beers, but it is definitely worth it! Occiasonally, there is even live music from some hippies in the back! Very good atmosphere. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I'm a student and on that kind of a budget, I can't really afford to come here that often, sadly.Good Food, Good Beer, Great Ambience & Free wifi too = Win Win Win Win!",
