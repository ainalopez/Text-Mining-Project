    "This was one of the best tapas restaurants we ate at in Barcelona. It gets very slammed at the busy lunch and dinner hours, people were coming in to make reservations for the weekend too. So make a reservation or come early. The sangria was great, the burrata and tomato starter was some of the best our group has ever had. \u00a0Potatoes bravas are the best we tried the entire trip. The lamb and skirt steak were really good too. Overall nothing on the menus disappointed and they have specials each day as well.",
