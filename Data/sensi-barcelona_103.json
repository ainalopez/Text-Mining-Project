    "The three times we ate here the food was amazing. \u00a0With a very helpful and friendly staff that speaks fluent English, French and Spanish just adds to the appeal of this fantastic place. Sersha and the rest of staff work their butts off to provide you with a great experience.The tapas choices are broad and not the typical I've found around town. They offer a Duck Timbale that was outstanding and shouldn't be missed. Tuna was perfect along with prawns, peppers and several other dishes. This place is a gem. A must for anyone. A quick note, the bar doesn't hold many people and I highly recommend reservations!",
