    "I loved this place! \u00a0This was our first stop on our food tour. \u00a0It has a totally local feel and from our tour guide, the locals love stopping here before or after a meal for a snack and drink or even for their main meal. \u00a0We had vermouth with olives, tomato bread, jamon, cheese, and two kinds of anchovies. \u00a0Loved it! \u00a0And I enjoyed the personal service with great surroundings of everyday and vintage local products with historical wine taps from the walls and above.",
