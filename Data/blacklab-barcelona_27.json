    "Really great beer and affordable, delicious food. At first I was a bit skeptical about an Asian menu at a brew pub, but it works! There's also traditional American style food, like burgers and fried chicken. The Portobello burger was AMAZING and I could have eaten a whole bucket of their beer battered fries. If you're sick of tapas and enjoy good beer, give this place a try.",
