    "Way way wayyyyy overrated! This place has like two things on the menu, so if you are hungry, just know this is a place to only have a snack. There is very little seating, so you may have to stand. I ordered these small little fried anchovies and they were cold and sitting on the counter for a while. I dunno, I don't get the reviews. Go to Sommorosotto for some amazing food.",
