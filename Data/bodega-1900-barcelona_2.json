    "We stopped in while waiting for their sister restaurant, Tickets, to open. \u00a0We had a few great tapas (croquettes and jamon ib\u00e9rico and sardines, all of which were delicious). We enjoyed it so much that we returned the next night for a full dinner (fried mini shrimp, cheese, a 2nd kind of jamon ib\u00e9rico, short rib empanadas, and the most exquisite chocolate dessert). \u00a0Definitely don't skip the dessert here! \u00a0The ingredients are all of the highest quality (like Tickets), but all in a more traditional style. \u00a0The staff were very friendly and happy to explain the menu.",
