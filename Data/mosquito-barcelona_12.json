    "This place seems popular among the locals and tourists. The restaurant is very small. Expect to sit close to strangers. They take reservations for large groups. Or you can sit at the bar.There is an English menu that has a variety of dim sums, dumplings, and some Asian entrees. Smoked duck dumpling is very good and flavorful.Xia long Bao wasn't soupy at all. Defeats it's purpose.Pork Shu Mai is very good.Kimchi is small but good.Wonton soup is small but good.Overall, I am surprised at how fresh everything tastes here. The only con for me is that every dumpling tasted too salty for me after I kept eating.",
