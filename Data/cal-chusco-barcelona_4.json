    "It was pouring rain as we strolled along Barcelonetta's boardwalk. \u00a0Looking to escape the series of paella-vending tourist traps on Passeig Joan de Borbo, we took a random turn away from the bright lights. \u00a0At the end of the block, about one minute from the main street, we saw Cal Chusco and decided to give it a try.Our first day in Barcelona, we wanted to sample tapas and still have money left for the rest of our stay. \u00a0At Cal Chusco, we drank beer, wine, horchata and soda and ate bread with tomato/olive oil, bacalao (cod), sandwiches, a salad and fried octopus. The waitress/chef was friendly and spoke to us in English, answering our questions about menu items. \u00a0It is worth noting, however, that there were no other tourists in the place. \u00a0There was a family celebrating their daughter's birthday, and a group of friends watching a game on television. It is a small place with a bar, good tapas and cheap prices close to the beach. Drinks averaged at about 2 euros and tapas were about 3 euros for good sized portions. A great place to sample local favorites.",
