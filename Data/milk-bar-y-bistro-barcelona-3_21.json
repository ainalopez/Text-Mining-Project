    "This was the first spot my hubby and I hit for bunch! And it was so worth it!! It was real easy to get to and was walking distance from our hotel in the Gothic quarter. It's a small place and a little stuffy so we chose to sit at the bar. I ordered the vegetarian omelette which came with fried potatoes and creme fraiche. My husband got the French toast. We washed it all down with a Bloody Mary and a freshly squeezed glass of orange juice. The eggs here (all over spain) are so fresh that they taste creamy and the fruit tastes so flavorful and sweet. Loved the orange juice. If you happen to be around the area, you must give the place a go:)",
