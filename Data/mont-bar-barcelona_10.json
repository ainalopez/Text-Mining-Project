    "The best meal we've had in Barcelona four days in (with four days to go). \u00a0Probably the first place we've been to that didn't cater to tourists.- Attentive service that was nicely paced- Enjoyed the outdoor seating on the street corner. \u00a0Lots of people watching- The olives were the best I've had. \u00a0The spice added a little something extra that we enjoyed- The burrata salad was an amazing start. \u00a0The freshness of the tomatoes, the perfect temperature of the burrata, combined with the nuts, dried fruit, and olive oil was the perfect start- Next came the tuna belly. \u00a0Just seriously wow. \u00a0It came out on a plate that had been recently covered and injected with smoke. \u00a0Tuna belly by itself is amazing, but the smoke, the large crystals of sea salt, and the touch of sauce (I couldn't identify it) combined to form one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. \u00a0It was so good, we ordered another- The red prawn ceviche was light and had a slight fruitiness that we liked- The steak tartare was ok. \u00a0It was prepared well, but it lacked that special somethingOverall, we really enjoyed our meal here and will long remember the amazing tuna belly.",
