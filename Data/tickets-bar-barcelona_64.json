    "We've been talking about going to Tickets for a year and 6 weeks ago I made the reservations and finally got to experience it last night. \u00a0We were led to the bar, which was a little disappointing on one hand because I wanted a more of a restaurant experience and not looking at a television for 2 hours, but we did get to see them assemble some of the dishes and that was worth it.Since it's all tapas for two we pretty much ordered one of everything. \u00a0Most everything was three bites for each of us, which was about perfect. \u00a0The majority of the dishes were beyond flavorful. \u00a0The first bite would always cause the reaction, \"Whoa?! \u00a0What did I just eat?\" The second bite was delicious. The last bite of everything was a little slice of heaven. \u00a0Since everything was so flavorful I think larger portions would have been too much.We both agreed that the tuna tartar was the superstar of the night. \u00a0The kimchi and crunch texture added it to list of best things I have ever eaten. \u00a0There we parted ways in how we ranked the tapas after that. David loved the oysters and I adored the manchego \u00a0miniairbags. \u00a0The reconstituted olives are the signature tapas for the place and a little more on the gimmicky side, but worth the experience. \u00a0The Liquid Baileys and Chocolate was the perfect finish.The only disappointment in the bunch was the crab, avocado cannoli. \u00a0Disappointment? Well, anywhere else it would have been amazing, but in comparison to everything else it was positively bland. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't think twice about eating it again, but I'd rather have a second helping of the tuna tartar.",
