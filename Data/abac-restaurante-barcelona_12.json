    "This does not feel like a 5 star experience. I dine and travel all over the world, eat anything from the top Michelin starred restaurant in Paris to street food in Honduras, and did not feel like this was an exceptional experience. The host was extremely rude when we were ten minutes late for our reservation, which was the result of holiday traffic, and made us wait out of principal as the restaurant was empty and our table was ready. Ambiance was blah, and the only person that had a pleasant demeanor was the assistant to the sommelier. Food was presented and done well, but the overall experience was not one I would recommend to friends.",
