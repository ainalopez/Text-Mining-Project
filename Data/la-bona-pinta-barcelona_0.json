    "At first I felt a little out of place. The owner spoke a little english, but enough to help guide me to some local craft beer. It was awesome. Yes. I spoke little spanish, but I felt so comfortable in the place I felt at home. The selection of beer was amazing. And I loved talking to the locals about places to go for wine or beer. Sure it doesn't have high end tapas, and it's not the largest place in Barcelona, \u00a0but it's intimacy and selection, not to mention the beautiful women who visit, gives it a 5 star in my book. Try it, if you don't like it, oh well....go to the Chinese deli/bar on the corner. For me, it's a diamond in the rough.",
