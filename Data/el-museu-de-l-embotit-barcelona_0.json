    "This place was close to our hotel and we walked by on a Friday night and saw how many people were eating there so the next night we chose to go there. We didn't know what Tapas we wanted cause we couldn't read the menu so the cook made us about 8 different dishes and it was fantastic!!! It really did amaze us how fresh the seafood was and the selections we received. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria and it was small and costly compared to other places we've been, but the quality overall was good!",
