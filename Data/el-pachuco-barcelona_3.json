    "I was born in Southern California so I know my way around Mexican food. El Pachuco is the real deal. It's been years since I've had Mexican food this good. We ordered the nachos, three tacos, and two quesadillas and that was more than enough for two people. The chips for the nachos are not bagged but made in house. Tacos were piled high and had a nice crunch from pork rind bits sprinkled on top. Portions are large and quite welcome in my opinion. We did not drink but watched a few drinks being made. Everything was made with quality ingredients and most defiantly strong. They have a massive collection of mescal sitting above the bar.I honestly think I've had the best Mexican food in my life here at El Pachuco.",
