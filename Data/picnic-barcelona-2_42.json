    "High end tapas for the same price you'd end up paying for considerably lower quality at any of the tourist trap locations along La Rambla or other places in Barcelona.We've \u00a0just had their Spring Roll and it was terrific. The Spanikopita is also great but ours could have used a touch more salt. Our next tapa was beef loin. Talk about the best reason to come here. Cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing. We finished of with a strawberry crumble. At this point, the place is going strong and teaming with patrons. Both locals and english speakers all enjoying the atmosphere and food. The dessert was spectacular, needless to say. Bathrooms (2 of them) are clean. Seats roughly 30 inside and 12 our so outside.The owners are a pleasure to speak with. If I lived here, I'd definitely return again and again.",
