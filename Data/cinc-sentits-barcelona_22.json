    "Greater than their single michelin star would suggest. Quality of ingredient, preparation and service were all flawless. Not molecular, avant garde, or experimental, but just flat out delicious well executed food. Highly, highly recommended and a pretty decent value for the quality of the experience. We ended up spending $300US after all taxes and service for two of the longer tasting menus and with a bottle of very nice Grenache. I can easily see spending closer to $500 for the same experience in a major American city.",
