    "I've eaten here twice since I've been abroad in BCN, both time equally enjoyable. The restaurant is exceptionally small with only a few tables inside, the sushi bar, and some outdoor seating so its highly suggested to make a reservation.Since I've been there ive been with a decent sized and hungry crowd so it made the most sense to order the \u00a0Nakashita Sake Maguro-24 assorted pieces and there was 2 pieces of Gunkan Sake in the middle which was an asbolute party in my mouth (favorite roll on the platter). We also got the Bluefin roll for the 2 of us which to date might be my favorite roll of sushi ever. Order the seafood fried rice as well, you wont be disappointed.Good, attentive waitstaff, prices were on the expensive side for what I'm used to on a students budget but for the quality/freshness/uniqueness of the rolls I'd say it was worth the money",
