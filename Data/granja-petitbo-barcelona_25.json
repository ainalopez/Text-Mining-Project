    "Whatever city I'm in, I try out cafes until I find the one that clicks. Granja Petitbo is that - its a charming ambience (Including a map that I want to steal so badly), the baristas are friendly and make you feel like you're in their home, and... the coffee/juices/food are all great! Even the hamburger is delicious - which (in my experience) is difficult to find in Europe. I do schoolwork here a lot... and I'm going to miss it when I go home. Please open a Granja Petitbo in Chicago?Timmy",
