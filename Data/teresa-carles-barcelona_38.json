    "Wow, amazing. I only eat chicken, but besides the point. Walked in and thought it would be okay but boy did it stun my eyes and taste. I got a great lunch special with a 3 course.Wonderful Quinoa salad w/ avacados and then went into a vegan meatball with verde sauce which was really tasty and great texture, last was a chia coconut cake that was spongey but a good taste and stunned it all off with a \"Virus Killer\" juice which was way beyond expectations. Def come back here and would reccomend to all eaters, no matter if you eat meat or not. Full of surprises and great choices that change by the week.",
