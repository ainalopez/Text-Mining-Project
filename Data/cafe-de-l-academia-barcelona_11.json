    "Went here for my birthday dinner while in Barca. I was not disappointed. Nice little restaurant tucked away on a little side street. The wait staff was great and even brought out my desert with a candle, turned down the lights, and played happy birthday on a saxophone. All my wife did was ask for a candle. Good selection of wines at reasonable prices. All the entres looked good and very traditional. I had a steak dish and wife had squid but in the style of pasta. Had the soup traditional to the region as well. All in all a real good find. Thanks Rick Steves.",
