    "Well, let me start by saying that when you go to the same place more than once during your 5 day stay in Barcelona, it is clear that this is must visit place. Seafood was very tasty, service was great, waiters are by accommodating and speak multiple languages. \u00a0We had the paella one day for lunch \u00a0and grilled sea bass the other day for dinner. I am trying to convince my family to go there one more time. Got so much more food to try. They also give you a free dessert and a digestive after dinner. Make sure to ask for a plate of their olives at the start of your meal. HIGHLY recommend it.",
