    "A very popular spot for Paellas, i dont want to say this place was overrated, but i think that people need to realize that our taste buds are all different and that our expectations of ones paella will be different from the usual paellas you would have in your city/country. We only had the black ink paella because this was something we were craving for. The rice was cooked to perfection. Although i do have a problem with the missing squid and seafood in it, the rice was the main feature. The portion was a decent amount, we came here at 4pm, just for a snack, so we werent planning on feasting here. Paella was 22euros, which was doubled of some local joints but this is 7 portes, and it is in a prime location, right at Barceloneta. We had the house white wine, which was only 6 euro for half the bottle, which i thought was fair of 7 Portes to charge for the cheapest wine they had. We also had the suckling pig, which we thought would be a bit bigger since it was over 20euros but it was a few pieces. An interesting point, the waiter would not serve the paella and the suckling pig at the same time, stating this would ruin our taste buds. I agree to a certain point because the suckling pig had a nice crispy skin to it, but it isnt like the ones you would have at a spanish neighborhood. \u00a0A bit disappointing, not something i would order again. The next time we do go back, i would try other paellas, as this is their strong suit. Food: 4/5 Service/price: 3/5Ambience: 5/5",
