    "ROMANCE!!!Everything; from the service to the food to the impressive background made this a magical night to remember.The menu selection was inventive although portions were a bit small for Barcelona. The staff was friendly from the beginning to the end. The background included candles, mutted colors and enough \"trompe d'oeil\" to keep you throughly entertained.",
