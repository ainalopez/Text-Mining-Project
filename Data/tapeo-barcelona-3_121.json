    "The beef cheeks were fall off the bone tender. \u00a0All we needed was a fork. \u00a0The cannelloni was delectable and rich. \u00a0The sauce was delightful. \u00a0This place is small so you can see them cooking with quality ingredients in the kitchen. \u00a0The only downside is that this place is a bit expensive.",
