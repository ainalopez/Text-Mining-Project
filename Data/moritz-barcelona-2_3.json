    "When a place is called a brew pub you expect a good selection of food and brew. Regrettably Fabrica Moritz only delivered on the variety of food - and wow, there is a ton! On the beer side not so much. Just a typical Pilsner type and a more amber version. I had frankly hoped for more. That being said, the amber was pretty tasty! I was able to force down a couple glasses!My food was uninspiring. Ordered a burger (had been craving one during this trip) and thought \"where better than a brew pub to get a burger?\" \u00a0Well, there clearly are better places cause this burger was quite red inside (not my favorite way to eat hamburger) and it was dripping all over the place. I'm \u00a0always a little concerned when I see that much red but it turned out ok. It didn't have a lot of taste but it served the purpose. Service was borderline terrible. So any hope of sending the burger back was nonexistent. My burger arrived a good 10 minutes before my wife's sandwich so we got to watch each other eat. Atmosphere is ok although I wish there had actually been a bar there to sit. I much prefer sitting at the bar drinking a couple and ordering a sandwich. I'd rather not wait to be seated at a table. They have NO bar. On the whole it's just an ok place. Beer is good. I'd try something different from the menu next time.",
