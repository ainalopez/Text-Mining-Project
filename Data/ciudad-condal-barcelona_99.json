    "Oh boy. Where do I begin?Everything's just perfect here. From the interior decor, to the service, to the price, and most importantly, the food. Assuming you do not follow typical Spanish eating times (I for one, visited at 6 PM, which was early for Spanish standards), you can get a seat. I was alone, but since there was no empty seat at the bar, I was seated at one of these tall circular tables good for 3 people. I ordered a small bottle of Vi\u00f1aSol (white wine, very potent); the Filipino server brought it out and stationed it in a small chiller. I began by ordering some Andaluz-style baby squid. Oh boy, what is this? You squeeze lemon, and pierce them with a toothpick, and a miracle erupts in your mouth. You do that over and over again, over white wine.Next, I asked for a recommendation from the server. I asked him if he can recommend something from the tapas list for the day. He brought me a skewered codfish, together with a tomato and a mussel, as well as a small sliver of a baguette drizzled in pesto oil (?). I loved how everything just went together perfectly. Finally, I ordered a flauta with foie gras and roquefort. Flautas apparently are small warm sandwiches, they're overfilled so be prepared to use your utensils, or lick your fingers. After all, they're finger-licking good. Anyway, that was a great dinner. By that time, I finished my wine, and I ordered an espresso to finish it off. Should I also say something about the service? It was great; they weren't intrusive, they don't press you into ordering immediately after finishing your previous plate. It was also a coincidence my server was Filipino, something I didn't expect.",
