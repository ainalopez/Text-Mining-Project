    "Yeah, this place was excellent. \u00a0It's located in a very clean, local market, Mercat del Ninot. \u00a0Much smaller than La Boqueria but way better maintained and nicer. \u00a0It felt like a local market (which it is) and not completely overrun with tourists. \u00a0The seafood was SO fresh. \u00a0Everything we ordered was cooked in such a simple way, but the flavours were absolutely fantastic!Service was definitely friendly, welcoming, and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. \u00a0Please keep in mind, this is not a typical restaurant. \u00a0You're sitting at a seafood bar. \u00a0Order a drink, enjoy watching the preparation of your food, and savour.At one point, our chef asked to take a photo with the lady next to me. \u00a0I was wondering who that was and found out it was Carme Ruscalleda, a Michelin 3 star (total of 5 star) chef! \u00a0She has 3 stars for her restaurant in Spain, and 2 more for the one in Tokyo! \u00a0How cool is that???",
