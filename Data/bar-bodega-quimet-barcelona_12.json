    "I cannot recommend this place highly enough. The food is very interesting, the decor charming, and the prices just right. The only caveats are that the menu is slightly adventurous and not available in English. \u00a0For example, the \u00a0the piquantito cheese is extremely \"piquant,\" meaning smelly, not \"picante\" meaning spicy. \u00a0However, there is a printed menu in addition to the chalkboard. I highly recommend the variety plate (slightly adventurous) and the skewers of pickled vegetables and chorizo-stuffed olives.There is a small selection of desert wine by the barrel that is also available to take away, though there is a small charge for the take away bottle.Stop reading and go.",
