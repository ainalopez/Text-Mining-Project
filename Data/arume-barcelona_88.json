    "My wife and mother in law do not eat seafood. \u00a0I spent 20 minutes with the hotel staff working on a dinner reservation. \u00a0I guess that work paid off. \u00a0This was our best meal after 3 days and 4 nights in Barcelona. \u00a0There are choices if you want carne and choices of you want seafood. \u00a0The paella was amazing. \u00a0My father in law, a seafood lover, said it was the best ceviche he has had in his life. \u00a0It's a quaint place with plenty of personality. \u00a0The kind of place you dream about visiting when you go to Barcelona. \u00a0We were so happy with this meal.",
