    "Beautiful food. Everything is amazing. We went for weekend brunch and sat outside. I had such a hard time deciding. In the end I got a fresh juice, and the stuffed squash blossoms. It was to die for. The cashew cream inside was swoon-worthy. The peas were little bursts of green sunshine in my mouth, and the red gogi berries were a sweet surprise. I would go here again and again and again to try everything. I had bites of the kale salad, and the mushroom tacos. I say again, everything is amazing.",
