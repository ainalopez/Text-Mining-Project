    "Hey Yelpers! The food is excellent here, and you really can't top the view. (I'll ask my hub to download some pics.) We went September last year, so the weather was sunny and great, and it's off the coast (\"beach\") which gave it a laid-back beachy feel, and our servers were really quick, and helpful. \u00a0Patrick H. of Santa Cruz, Cali is correct in saying this is a local place, and I could taste why. This is not a tourist trap, like half of the places we tried. The pork-stuffed squash flower appetizer was delicious! (my hub didn't like, but more for me!) The seafood is soooo fresh, and not overcooked; the prawns were perfect. \u00a0Since we had arroz negro at another location (Xaica:, delicious! review to come), we chose the fideu(sp?), noodles... which is just as good, but the flavor we chose tasted like file used in gumbo. \u00a0It was still really good, (My hubby's fam is from Louisiana, so you understand why I mention this?) \u00a0but If we had more time, I would of liked to go back and try the arroz dishes. \u00a0If you go, let me know what YOU think! I got lucky picking this place based on the few reviews on Yelp. \u00a0(Thanks for your cue, Patrick H.)",
