    "Everyone should try this place at least once in their lifetime - if they can get a reservation. From the creators of El Bulli, this is molecular gastronomy at its best. Each mouthful, each bite will tickle and/or caress all of your senses. It's art + science + cuisine + love = culinary ecstasy. The cocktails are also out of this world, although in it. Each creation at 41 is a masterpiece and it's worth the price. You'll have an orgasm in your mouth, and that's no BS.",
