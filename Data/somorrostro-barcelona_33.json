    "We stumbled into this rustic local restaurant - close to the tourist trap of Little Barcelona and we feel so fortunate. \u00a0We love Victoria - part owner/server and the chef and suzie. We loved everything that we are there. Their Slow Cook - everything is all ingredients locally grown/caught- are fresh and delightful. \u00a0Their garden heirloom tomatoes with sea salt was my staple. We have been there 4 times in three days and brought friends to them and they all agreed. All of their seafood is freshly caught and prepared. Loved them all. Desserts- their cheesecake in a mason jar with fresh strawberries Amd cucumbers is light and refreshing !!! We tried a one 1 star michelin restaurant and left their and went back to somorrosto for desserts. The decor is rustic and authentic. \u00a0Loved it.",
