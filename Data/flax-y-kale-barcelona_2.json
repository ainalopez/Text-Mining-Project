    "I expected much more from this trending restaurant which every foodie in Barcelona talks about. They have different menus depending on the time of the day you go, you can have breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner or a simple snack at any time of the day. The food is mostly vegetarian and vegan but they have a few common dishes, too. I got to know Flax&Kale some months ago when I was looking for a cool place to have a snack and hide from the sun of August in Barcelona and I felt attracted by the look of this restaurant. I did not left with a good feeling but I thought it was just me that went wrong with what I ordered. That was when I started searching more info about them and reading more reviews (most of them excellent or very good) and some time later I decided to give it a second chance. The experience was not so different from the first time but it was slightly better thanks to an overloaded a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl that I had, but the service was too slow and not specially kind. Also, I think their products are a little overpriced due to the popularity they are getting lately. So, I would say that the best thing about this place is the ambiance and decoration, which are very important but not as much as the quality of the food (or at least how it tastes) and that's why I cannot give it more than three stars. I think it just turned into a meeting point for hipsters more than a place of reference for all those vegans out there. It is not a bad restaurant but I don't think it deserves all the hype around it.",
