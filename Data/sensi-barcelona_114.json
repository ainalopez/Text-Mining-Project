    "We went to Sensi during our vacation in Barcelona. We found it on yelp based on the good reviews. We tried all different types of tapas - tuna, duck, paella, potato, baby chorizo, etc. the food is fine, we liked the potato, duck and baby chorizo; however the paella is not that good comparing to the other restaurants we went to. The price is a little high and they charge for bread 1 euro per person, which we don't find in any other restaurants in Barcelona. It seems people eating there are mostly tourists, English speaking people around our table.",
