    "Lovely place!Really efficient service and the tapas were simply yummy! I loved every dish even the tomato rubbed bread!I was with a bigger group and as soon as we sat down, the restaurant brought us each a glass of cava- on the house! Definitely felt welcomed and made me feel so happy to be there.I do want to especially call out the garlic shrimp- Gambas al ajilo: the shrimp was fresh and so nicely sizzling in the garlic oil... The garlic pieces were nicely fried and while I am typically fearful of having the garlic odor linger, these garlic pieces were prepared right that the pungent odor transformed into salivating inducing \u00a0aroma! Loved!The place is nestled in the Born and very close proximity to the Picasso museum and within a 5 minute walk from the barcelona cathedral. I'd go back if I ever return to Barcelona!",
