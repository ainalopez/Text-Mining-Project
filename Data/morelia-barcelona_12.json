    "our first dinner in Barcelona. \u00a0i wasnt that hungry so i just got a warm goat cheese and arugula salad - it was amazing. \u00a0Hubby got pasta - he loved it. \u00a0and they brought us yummy little teaser samplings of their soup of the day, which was delicious. \u00a0great service, cool vibe and sweet locale.",
