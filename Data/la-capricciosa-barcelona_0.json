    "Anything you order in this Italian restaurant is a good choice. All pasta plates are delicious and you can combine any kind of pasta with your favorite sauce, so you basically make your own plate. Pizzas are also nice (and big, like the original ones!). Totally recommended but make sure to have a reservation because otherwise you won't have a seat!",
