    "Hola a todos! I will write this review in English so more people can enjoy this place. Hands down the best creative tapas I have tried. This is NOT your traditional tapas place, this is something different and very surprising in a positive way. They have won the Mejor Tapa de la Ruta de Tapas prize for their Foie tapa, a smoky, rich, slightly sweet, velvety tapa made with foie gras with caramelized onion and cherry preserve- this is a must try. There is a lot of stuff to choose from and its all fresh, even on a rainy Monday evening. Best friendly and funny service too. Highly recommended.",
