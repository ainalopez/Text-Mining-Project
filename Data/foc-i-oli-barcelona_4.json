    "The chivito at this charming hole in the wall is truly a.ma.zing. Warm, melt in your mouth deliciousness on a super pillowy bun. I have no doubt that their other burgers are also quite yummy, but we're in Barcelona for a month and I will be back for the chivito. \u00a0P.S. Super kind staff. They have menus in English - just ask. There are only 6 or 8 stools at two counters. We scored two by the window for great people watching.",
