    "I have eaten in this place a couple of times over my 3-week stay in Barcelona. Overall it is a good experience. The staff are friendly, the atmosphere is quite nice, and the food is very good. I have eaten the pizza, ravioli w/ amatriciana sauce, veal w/ four cheese sauce as well as balsamic reduction, and some of the salads. Keep in mind I went with family and tried a little bit of everyone else's food and did not eat all of this on my own. \u00a0The ravioli amatriciana in my opinion was just delicious. A tomato based sauce w/ onion and bacon... WOW, that bacon stands out and gives it \u00a0a wonderful deep, rich meaty taste. I would definitely put this on my list of good Italian food if you find yourself in the neighborhood. Apparently they have a couple of locations around the city. I cannot speak for the others, but the one I went to was delicious. Good appetite my friends!Came back to visit summer 2013 and my review stands. The food is delicious and the service is great. Bon a petit friends!",
