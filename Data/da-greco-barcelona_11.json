    "Best. Meal. Ever.Not an exaggeration. It's in our Top 5 for sure.Recommendations:- Prosciutto with figs, if it's available/in season. The figs were divine.- The pasta sampler/trio, in which they basically bring you a \"small\" plate of whatever they're making in the kitchen at that time, so you can try a bunch of different things. We ended up with 2 creamy mushroom sauce dishes, which normally we don't like, but the food here is so good I devoured it all.- The ravioli. My favorite, and just incredible.- Risotto cooked in parmesan wheel. My boyfriend felt like he was eating heaven with every bite.- Tiramisu. I'm not normally that big on tiramisu, but this was the best I've ever had.As if the spectacular food weren't enough, the service is also very good, the decor upscale and quirky, and the prices practically \"cheap.\" (HOW?! I don't know. I would have easily/willingly paid double.) Another nice touch: owner/chef comes out to take your order himself.Do yourself a favor and dine at Da Greco. You won't regret it.",
