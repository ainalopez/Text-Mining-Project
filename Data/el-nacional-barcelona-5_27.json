    "Really cool place in the center of Barcelona. We had dinner at the tapas restaurant and it's highly recommended. Cold tapas can be ordered from their menu, but the way to order warm tapas is totally different, innovative and fun! Waiters walk around tables with whatever comes out fresh from the kitchen. Customers can check out what they have and if they want to eat it they have to waive their hands and be the first ones to get it. You basically compete with the rest of the customers. You have to be fast. They serve beer in mason jars!",
