    "Great hybrid between a traditional Spanish menu with a modern artsy feel. Good place for a casual brunch or to do some work (wifi is free).Beautiful decor of rustic wood, stone and brick, and hanging copper lamps and in the trendy Barcelona neighborhood, Gracia.Salmon Tartare, in house made brie with truffle, and the bread are all amazing.Place has an authentic feel and not too touristy, but still has an English menu option.",
