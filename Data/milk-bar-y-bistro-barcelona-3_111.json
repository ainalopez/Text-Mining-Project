    "I love brunch more than most people, so I was obviously very excited to stumble upon Milk while in Barcelona. The space is eclectic and cozy and the food was fantastic. I had the huevos rancheros - the eggs were PERFECT - and my boyfriend had the fry-up (he ate the whole plate). Serving portions are generous, similar to American brunches, and prices are comparative. I also remember the coffee being exceptional. Definitely stop by if you're looking for a brunch fix!",
