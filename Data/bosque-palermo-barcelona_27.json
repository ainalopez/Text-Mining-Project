    "After a lot of research for local paella spots I settled on Bosque Palermo. \u00a0Solid paella, brisk but efficient service and a lively atmosphere made this a good neighborhood spot but not the mind-blowing paella I was originally hopeful for.We walked in around 930pm on a Monday and waited 15 minutes or so for a table for two. \u00a0I knew we'd definitely be ordered a seafood paella but after seeing that it takes about 30 mins to cook scanned the menu for appetizers. \u00a0We ordered their appetizer sampler which came out in about 3 minutes and contained various slices of cured meats (sadly no jamon) including buttifara (white sausage), a spicy sausage and what looked and tasted like American deli ham as well as slices of white Spanish cheese, some Russian potato salad (very mayonnaise-heavy), a croqueta, and some really good friend squid. \u00a0The platter was ok but I would have happily had none of the ham or the potato salad and still been fine with the price. \u00a0We also ordered pan con tomate which was toasty and tomato-y with a light drizzle of olive oil.After a couple of glasses of house sangria (which were pretty strong and sweet but solid) our paella arrived. \u00a0Great presentation, with lots of seafood and shrimps who were playfully plated to seem like they were looking at us, and a very generous portion for two people. \u00a0The paella itself was good but I wish the rice had a bit more of a crust - it was a little mushy for my preference. \u00a0The seafood was decently cooked - the mussels were a little overdone but the shrimp and squid were cooked very well. \u00a0We definitely had way more food than we needed and so for a bang for your buck standpoint it was a great value.",
