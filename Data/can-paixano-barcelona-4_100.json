    "Very easy to find, in spite of there being no sign outside marking the restaurant. Strict policy regarding drinking- must order food if you plan do drink AND for every three glasses of cava- you must order another item to eat. Pretty great, in my opinion.Food was glorious- I had the hamburguesa, bacon, y picadillos. It had yummy caramelized onion layering the bottom bun and gooey cheese melted over it. Was beautiful to look at and the cava rosa was out of this world. My husband and I each got a sandwich and glass of cava each and it was less than 10 euros. A win all around.",
