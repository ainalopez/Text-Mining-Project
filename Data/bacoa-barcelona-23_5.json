    "The burger was (pretty) good, it was well cooked and substantial. However, I wouldn't be convinced of the overall quality of the meat. The toppings I got on my burger (the bacoa) were delicious. The bun was terrible, I went for the 'integral' and for whatever reason it wasn't toasted, which worsened the messiness of the situation because of the slippy, soft bun. The patatas bravas were not great either, but not bad. I wouldn't ever hold it against a restaurant for me not enjoying the meal, but what made the experience largely unenjoyable was the misleading menu. The burgers are pretty expensive themselves and add ons like sauces or cheese are not given prices on the ordering menu. You could end up paying 13 Euros for a burger and French fries if you're not paying attention, which is far and above the quality of the food you're getting. I shouldn't have to calculate what I'm paying for a burger, it should be obvious from what I'm ordering.",
