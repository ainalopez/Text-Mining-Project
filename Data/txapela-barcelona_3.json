    "This place is awful - a total tourist trap (I counted 3 locations within blocks of each other)! I had an inkling going in, but I was tired from walking around all day and just wanted to sit down. My feelings were confirmed when we were handed menus with pages in a bunch of different languages including English, Japanese and Russian. Although the prices might seem cheap, around 2 euros, you are paying PER PIECE. Or maybe I should say per bite. For example at another restaurant I think we paid around 4 euros for a plate of 4 croquetas and at Txapela it was something like 1.85/each. Total rip off! The food wasn't even very good. Most everything is pre-made and sitting behind the glass on the counter and presented on a piece of stale toast. I will say, I felt bad for the girls working behind the counter. Not only were they taking orders from everyone seated at the fairly large counter, but they also had to fill the tapas orders for the entire restaurant! Avoid at all costs!",
