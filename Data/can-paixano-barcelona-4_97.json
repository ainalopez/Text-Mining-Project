    "This place is a must stop for travelers on a budget, sure is small, filled with people, hard to find but it's cheap and delicious. You should also appreciate the value and importance of a bottle of cava with your meal \u00a0for less than 10 euros (I recommend drinking it all and then walking around... the marina and Las Ramblas are nearby)Vegetarians be aware there is not much for you there \u00a0and the ceiling is full of hanging pieces of ham and with a bit of luck some animal \u00a0fat might drop nearby. It's an experience!",
