    "We ran into this pintxos place after Mass on Sunday at de Catedral de Barcelona. Love the way that you choose your items and then are charged by the number of sticks (Skewers) you end up with on the table! The wine and Basque tapas were delicious! They even had mini lasagnas to try. And lots of mini-desserts!A few days later we returned again it was so delicious the first time!",
