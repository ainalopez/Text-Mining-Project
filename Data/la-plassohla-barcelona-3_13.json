    "This was a great spot for food after seeing a show at the Palau Musica since they stay open a little later than other restaurants in Barcelona. \u00a0It's tapas with a fine dining flair that we enjoyed as a change up from the salt-of-the-earth food we'd been indulging in previously on the trip. \u00a0We had a great bottle of cava. \u00a0The pork cheek bacon sandwich, pan con tomate, and poached egg with sausage and beans were all really delicious. \u00a0The staff were professional and attentive and seemed to have good English. \u00a0Their menu includes a Spanish, English, and French version.",
