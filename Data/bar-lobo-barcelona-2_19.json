    "Absolutely the best dining experience we had while in Barcelona. AMBIENCE: First of all, the place is chic - chic in that new-age meets mid-century modern, 2014 takes on streamlined simplicity sort of way. Teak two party tables, sleek metal bars, and perfectly selected music (something like RJD2) all melt together to create the perfect ambience/atmosphere (at least to me). SERVICE: Although our waiter was new (it literally was his second day....who starts a waiter on a Friday night?!?), the service was still excellent. He flubbed our drink once, but quickly came to correct his mistake and promptly brought us new beverages. They even changed my mojito for me, just because I'm cheap and don't want a ton of ice (more drankkk pleaseee). Our waiter was sweet and friendly, as was everyone who served us.FOOD: The food was DIVINE - asparagus tempura (tapas) is amazinggggggggggg. We, being the greedy heathens we are, ordered like two extra orders of it. The Spinach salad (light dish) with blue cheese, apple, and bacon too, is perfectly blended. It's just...ugh. Delicious. I ordered the veal, which was quite interesting, as the mustard almost had a horseradish kick to it. All the meats in Spain are delicious (to me), so I was quite please (although it was a bit too heavy for me. Should have gone with the chicken or duck). DRINKS: Mad good. Enough said. We had an amazing night here. This place seriously became a highlight for me - good food, good drinks, great restaurant, good friends/company, and great weather - and Paige is a happy girl!",
