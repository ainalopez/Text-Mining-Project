    "I don't know what's not to like. The portions are really generous, the food is really good, and the cava is too cheap and free flowing. I situated my 5-feet-tall self at the bar in an effort to be assertive and met a lovely couple Canadian couple. An hour and a half later, I was full from a sandwich, chicken croquettas, a few glasses of cava, and great conversation. People were now ordering over me and spilling their ros\u00e9 on me. I guess in ten years, this is the kind of stuff I would pay a premium to avoid, but I felt great leaving this place. It's so full of life and character.It's magic how there are that many people packed into such a small space and yet the men behind the counter keep track of what each person has ordered without writing down a single thing.",
