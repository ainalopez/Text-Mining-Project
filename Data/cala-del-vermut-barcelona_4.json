    "Loved this place....the proprietress makes it special! Family-run bar with two other locations (3 total...just doors apart!) and House-made sweet vermouth! Who knew there even was such a thing! Delicious (add a splash of soda if you like) on a warm sunny Barcelona afternoon! The tapas are good (pre-made, then reheated) but the family, neighborhood vibe makes it great!",
