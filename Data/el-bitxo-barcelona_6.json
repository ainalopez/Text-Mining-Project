    "Nice quaint spot next to Palau De La Musica. Happened to come across this tiny Tapas place, down a small side alley near Music Palace and what a find it was!Friendly service, great food and drink, nice music to sit and enjoy and very reasonably priced.If you are in the area, I highly recommend stopping by.",
