    "Great prices and great food and friendly staff.This was the first place we ate after we landed in Barcelona after spending four days in Paris. We had delicious pizza, pasta, salad and sangria here, all for really good prices. Not difficult to find off passeig de Gracia, definitely worth the stop if you're in this area (like a block or two from la pedrera).Overall a great experience especially after dealing with some real assholes in Parisian restaurants, it was a welcome sight to see people being friendly and welcoming to tourists. Will definitely return when I go back to Barcelona.",
