    "Food was tasty, but I preferred Estrella beer to Moritz. Restaurant was very crowded. Our particular waitress was not very good. I asked one of the circulating floor managers to get me the correct drink since every time I tried to catch the waitress' eye, she looked away. The same floor manager brought us drink refills since our waitress never did.",
