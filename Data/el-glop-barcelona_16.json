    "This place was recommended to us by a local - it's way out of the touristy area and about 15 min from the nearest subway (there are two nearby) stations. Very hard to find if you don't know exactly where you go - it's small (on the outside) and well hidden. Inside, it's fairly large with several halls and plenty of people. Food was very reasonably priced - under 50 euros for a full dinner (appetizers, main dish, etc) for two with drinks. Service was impeccable as well. Food was very good too. Wouldn't exactly call it extraordinary, but well worth the trip. Salmon and sausages dishes were up to par. Octopus appetizer was nothing special, but reasonably tasty. Very good sangria - probably one of the best we've tried in Barcelona. Overall - recommend as a dinner place. Not extremely romantic as it's packed with tables pretty close to each other to fit more people and open kitchen making the place pretty noisy.",
