    "Came here right when lunch was over, but we were seated. \u00a0My fianc\u00e9 and I tried the paella for two people. \u00a0The paella was good, but it wasn't filled with much flavor as I thought it would. \u00a0The service here was really good and if you're looking for a nice place to eat this is it. Don't forget your glass of champagne when checking into Yelp.",
