    "I don't know if they are the best ham sandwiches in the world but they were certainly the best ham sandwiches I had in Spain - I tried 3 other places. \u00a0I liked this place so much I ate here twice. \u00a0It's just easy, fast, affordable and delicious. \u00a0My brother came back 3 times! \u00a0We always ordered the same thing - the mini flauta d'Iberic. \u00a0The warm fresh bread is crunchy outside and soft on the inside. \u00a0The ham is thinly sliced and perfectly salty. \u00a0At other places, the ham is too rubbery or overly salty, \u00a0or the bread is very hard. \u00a0Viena does it just right.The place is casual and filled with tourists from all over the world.",
