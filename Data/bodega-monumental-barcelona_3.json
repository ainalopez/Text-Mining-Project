    "The food was palatable but not extraordinary- I mean I've had better \u20ac50 meals for 2 before- but the rioja de mesa was CHEAP, CHEAP and plentiful. I drank myself into a stupor during this giggly 2-hour dinner with one of my best friends. The best thing about Spanish wine is it doesn't get you stupid drunk, just happy drunk.My friend ordered the swordfish which honestly looked kind of leathery and was perched atop a soupy substance that I think was pureed carrots. Kind of weird. I had the patatas bravas, the bomba and something else that I can't even remember. It was a lot of potato for one meal. If we had to do it all over again, we would have ordered the paella. You have to order for a minimum of two people which turned us off but had we known that this was pretty standard at all Spanish restaurants we would have caved. A few other tables ordered it and it looked phenomenal. If you are considering what to do around this area, we took the hop-on/hop-off bus to Plaza Espa\u00f1a for the fountain display show at 9pm (Fri/Sat in the spring and summer) up the hill near the huge museum. I expected it to be a cheesy tourist spectacle but even I, Courtney the Cynic, was impressed. \u00a0This was my favorite memory of Barcelona- cheese, wine, coffee with Bailey's, people-watching galore, witnessing the sun set from the top of a one of Barcelona's most beautiful monuments, and being around hundreds of others enjoying simple things. I liked it more than Park Guell, the Sagrada Familia, and the harbor front. After the masses dispersed, we walked the short hike to Bodega to cap off the rest of a wonderful evening. The metro is at the Plaza and runs late on the weekends.",
