    "This place is a great concept, that is if you go while the \"pintxos\" part is open. You have a full bar top filled with different pintxos, which by the way only cost 1.70 euro each one. Whether it's a fish type pintxo or a croqueta or even a dessert pintxo, you will not be disappointed. A great spot to stop at while you're walking the Gothic District of Barcelona.",
