    "I really enjoyed the food and the rustic atmosphere.Located by the Caterina market it a wonderful spot where to dine or simply have some delicious tapas with a drink!We did both and plan to be back.For lunch we had he turbot fish (amazing) and grilled calamari with asparagus. The gazpacho was good too.Even the bread is good.We ended our meal with one of the best Catalan cream I had in a while.For tapas I recommend fried artichokes, cod croquettes, fired eggplants with honey, pescaditto frittos and everything was delish!",
