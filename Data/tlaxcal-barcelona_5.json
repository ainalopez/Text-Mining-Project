    "The food was actually quite nice, if overpriced.we all had tacos: fish, carnitas, ternera.Unfortunately when we went there the service was really bad. The staff were rude from the moment we got in, like it was a hassle that we had come. They were also pushy about us ordering (which i can kind of understand if it was busy). It could have all been just a bad experience for us, but there are tons of plaxes in Barcelona that have good food and service.",
