    "Tasty spot! I just grabbed a beer and a quick tapa. They have a variety of different beers from all over Spain and some from other parts of Europe. The beer I had was delicious, it was a Spanish one, I can't remember the name of. We had some potatoes with a spicy sauce. They were very tasty. The bar itself is very cute, very eclectic and pretty hipster.",
