    "out of all the food research I did prior to arriving in Barcelona, I found that the places I found tucked away without a claim to fame were the ones I was immediately drawn and remember the most- Txirimiri was one spur of the moment find after a day of barcelona beach tanning.the set up:]tables or bar seating. I prefer the bar in a casual atmosphere, especially if we are there just for drinks -no sense in having a server run back in fourth to dispense drinks- just sit at the bar and get quick service. Plus it's always fun to banter back in fourth in my broken spanish with the bartender.to taste:]The tapas on the display are called \"Pinchos\" they are small bit-sized portions served on top of bread. each case has a variety of some sort so be adventurous and try the appealing ones first and always finish with a briny fish topped one. the situation is self serve for the pintxos, your tab is kept by how many skewers you have on your place, eat away and drink up! The sangria is a beautiful dusty mauve color, spicy, refreshing, and lovely following hours in the sun. In true Spanish/Catalan fashion we finished with a cafe con leche. This was a perfect place to unwind, hid from the sun and continue day drinking.",
