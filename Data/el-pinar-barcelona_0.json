    "We live in a global market, that tends to homogenize everything, accommodating places better to all different tastes. That means that lately it is difficult to find places with its own different flavour. In my opinion this is a pity, because we are loosing part of our history in this process, a history that may be gone forever. However, sometimes you can find hiding gems that makes you believe and let you think that there is still hope. One of these places is El Pinar. I didn't have the opportunity to enjoy their lunch menu, but I can tell you that the place is almost full during lunch time. I just have the chance to have some ice coffee and some beers there, and the place is worth it, from the vibe, to the music and the waiters. Also the decoration is eclectic, with posters of all movies hanging from the walls to a paint in one of the cabinets. Please, El Pinar, promise me that you will never change!",
