    "One of the best dining experience in a long time. I was there at 7.30pm and had no trouble to get a seat by the bar. By about 8pm people started pouring in and when I left, there was a long queue of customers waiting to get seats!If you are in Barcelona, try this at least once. The food is so good. The only disappointment was the wine. I could have given it 5 stars but the real rating is 4.5 stars.",
