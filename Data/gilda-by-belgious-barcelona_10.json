    "Not a typical spanish bar but definitely recommendable!We went here on our first night at Barcelona. We didn't have a clue where to go and everything else was either packed or entirely empty which is always a very bad sign.Tables and the bar are in seperate rooms which is good for the noise level while having lunch/ dinner. The bar is quite fancy as well is the food. You'll find traditional spanish tapas and main dishes at the menu as well as nice specials from belgium. The owner is from belgium. We had tapas that night but the main dishes people had around us looked very good too.The service was decent and honest that night. I appreciated very much, that the owner of the restaurant/ bar come to the tables to have a little chat with the people, give recommendation etc. For me this is the little extra thing that distinguishes a good location from a very good location.I'll most likely come here again on my next stay in Barcelona.",
