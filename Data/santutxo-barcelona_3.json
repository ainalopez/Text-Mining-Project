    "Good burgers. Small neighborhood hidden gem. The waiter working was an excellent multitasker, he looked exhausted because he'd been working a shift on his own. Cooking, serving, cleaning, stocking, and yet remained hospitable towards all the guests. The burger had lots of flavor. Patatas Bravas were piping hot and fresh.",
