    "My family and I were looking for a knock-out place to experience paella for the first time in Spain. Some quick googling and poking around on Yelp and TripAdvisor yielded Restaurant Arume as a supposedly unmissable destination. Alas, perhaps we chose our dishes poorly, or maybe the kitchen was just having an off-day...but the majority of the offerings fell short of my inflated expectations.For starters, we began with the goat cheese-spinach fritters, which were creamy and packed with flavor. The chorizo tacos, on the other hand, were highly forgettable. In terms of paella, we ordered both duck and seafood varieties. Firstly, we were a little disappointed at the portion size: two orders were barely enough for six people. The duck-topped rice was so-so, with meat that wasn't gamey but that lacked complexity and succulence. The seafood pasta was much better, with sweet, smoky rice infused with the taste of delicious shrimp, muscles, and calamari. We also ordered a pork dish, the details of which have slipped my mind. All I remember is that it was served medium to medium-rare and was a big hit. Besides food, the blackberry mojito is highly unique and strikes a tantalizing harmony between tart and sweet. At the risk of sounding contrarian, Arume's dishes were underwhelming, especially considering the quality of the culinary artistry we saw throughout our stay in Spain. While the service was pleasant and the winding, labyrinthine interior gives the establishment a timeless gothic feel, I can't help feeling there are superior options available at such a steep price point.",
