    "Stopped in here for some sangria and a few tapas before heading to anotherrestaurant to have desserts. I can't say the food was bad or the prices were outrageous. In fact, everything we ordered was quite good and the bill was very reasonable - but this place is run by an entire English-speaking staff and designed for tourists who want the \"tapas experience\" without venturing too far out of their comfort zone. To sum it up: it is good food, in a very touristy restaurant. Sure, every city needs this kind of place, but there were a few other issues that rubbed me the wrong way...1. Since we were headed elsewhere for a 5-course dessert tasting we were attempting to keep it light. When we placed our order for 3 tapas, we were informed there was a 4 tapa minimum. A tapas minimum, whaaaat? This SCREAMS tourist trap to me.2. We were charged a .90 euro per person cover charge/bread fee. 3. When they processed our credit card the server asked us if we wanted to add anything on to the total - a.k.a trying to scam tip-happy Americans that don't know europeans don't tip like we do in the US.Go there if you are not seeking authentic cuisine, otherwise find somewhere else in this city full of better options.",
