    "This is my favorite tapas place in Barcelona. It's located on a pedestrian street of the Ramblas that is not overrun with tourists. A myriad of tapas are on display. Take as little or as much as you want, and your bill will be tallied according to the number of plates on your table. Inexpensive and high quality. Organic wines also served.",
