    "LOVED this place! Was visiting Barcelona with my father who is Argentinian and we were looking for a good place to eat some empanadas. Rekons is very casual and it was full of locals - always a good sign! They have an incredible selection of empanadas - we both got the deal where you get 3 and a salad plus a drink. The portions were very generous and the food was really tasty! Great to be able to drink Argentinian beer too :) The staff were super friendly and we had a good laugh with them. Would love to go back here next time I'm in Barcelona!",
