    "I LOVE this place...Its hard to find... small, a little dingy but not dirty, and super packed. \u00a0But the cheap bubbly and great vibe have me and everyone else coming all the time. \u00a0The epitome of cheap and cheerful... bubbly is fun but you have to order each round with some food. \u00a0Decent sized pours (not huge) with each round. \u00a0After a few rounds you should leave very happy... I think there's 4-5 types of bubbly to pick from so its not a hard menu. \u00a0Each pour is a little over a euro or 2.It can be intimidating but you have to get in and find a spot. \u00a0Get to know the people around you it will be very crowded the entire time. \u00a0And don't wear your best shoes, napkins are tossed on the ground.",
