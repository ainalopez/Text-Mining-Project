    "Great for drinks and appetizers. We stayed nearby for about a week and this was by far our favorite place to hang out for mojitos, long islands, and snacks. We had brunch here and the eggs Benedict and omelettes \u00a0were great. The fried plantains, fried green tomatoes and nachos were amazing for snacks. Negatives: Potatoes did not seem fresh and pitcher of mimosas had ice in it (very weird) which watered the mimosa down. Coffee was not hot and not strong enough for us either. Mojitos have too much sugar in them so we asked for light sugar in our drinks. Overall this place has great brunch, snacks and drinks and I would definitely come back the next time I visit Barcelona.",
