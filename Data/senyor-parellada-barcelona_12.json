    "After a long day of walking, this restaurant offered just the cozy, classy atmosphere that we needed for a warm, relaxing dinner.We waited in line for about 20 minutes to get a table, but it was well worth the wait. \u00a0Everything we ate was delicious. \u00a0My husband had a tuna steak, and I had the canneloni. \u00a0For dessert, I had the creme catalan, which set the standard for us for the rest of our trip around Spain. \u00a0The decor is cozy, with great lighting, warm colours, and a mix of styles that makes anyone (of all ages) feel welcome. \u00a0Definitely recommend!",
