    "This was our favorite meal in Barcelona. Great house made white wine and loved the dry pink Cava. Food was excellent, our server was really sweet, and the manager (maybe owner?) helped select all of our food for us based on our preferences. We never even saw a menu. Also pretty affordable!We're definitely going back.",
