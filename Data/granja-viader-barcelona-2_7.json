    "We loved this place. Unfortunately we went there only one time because it was always crowded so we did not want to waste our time standing in line. After the holidays early in a morning we stopped by (our hotel was not far away from this place) and there was no crowd at all. So we were \u00a0able to enjoy their wonderful food in a hectic free environment. They have menus in different languages. I had gotten one in English and the waiter looked at me and brought me one in Spanish. \"The one you've got is in English?!\" he told me. I was all flattered and felt like giving them a five star review on the spot!!!Food and drinks we ordered were very good. Mato with honey (Mel i Mato) was very fresh. Absolutely delicious. \u00a0My chocolate with whipped cream was excellent. It seemed like it would be too sweet but the whipped cream on top had no sugar in it whatsoever. \u00a0So it was just right.",
