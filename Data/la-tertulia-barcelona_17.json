    "On our first day in Barcelona, we crashed in our place in Poblenou and hit the Rambla de Poblenou for some grub. \u00a0We found this place on Yelp and it did not disappoint. \u00a0We had the fried fish, mussels, grilled prawns, chorizo and spicy potatoes w/mayo (yum!). \u00a0It was all definitely worth it...and the price was great as well!",
