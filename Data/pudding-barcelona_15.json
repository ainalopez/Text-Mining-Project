    "Adorable place to visit if you get the chance. We, unfortunately, were only in Barcelona during the week, so we didn't get to try their brunch. But, my sister and I both had a big slice of the mouthwatering sky-high tortilla. Neither of us could finish! This is a very sweet place just a tiny bit off the tourist track.",
