    "One star because it is a place that serves food to people. After 5 years of eating tapas regularly all around Barcelona, I was forced to eat here when a friend from NYC came to visit and had been hearing all the rave.It's basically a tourist trap with a cleaned up ambiance. The bread was dry, the cheese was below average, the fried peppers were cooked in bad oil, and I can't even remember the other forgettable plates. My friends tried the small hamburgers and said they lacked flavour and were just plain bad. Perhaps we were there on an off night and can only hope it gets better because I can't imagine recommending it to anyone. Not a true tapas (relaxed+delicious) experience.",
