    "Out of all the meats and all the cheeses and all of the wine in all of Barcelona, none even come close to holding a candle to the marvelous smorgasbord offered at Recasens. Don't believe me? Then consider this: during our 10-day stay in Barcelona, Recasens is the only place we went to more than once, and still think about and crave to this day. The place is gorgeous - rustic European charcuterie and cheese shop meets romantic bistro with low lighting, exceptional service and a drool-worthy menu boasting flat breads, hearty salads, house-cured meats, cheeses and fabulous local vinos. Look no further than the tasting menu, friends. There is no need. You and your companion split a generous and ample salad full of fresh greens, amazing stewed mushrooms (and I'm not a huge mushrooms fan), copious veggies and cheese. You then move onto The Board - piled high with various chouricos, cured sausages, jamon and even lomo (lamb) complimented by even more variaties of cheese (one even was even flecked pepperoni spices) that are all sinfully delicious and unique. With the food, you get a bottle of wine that they thoughtfully select to pair with the board you get. All of it is heavenly, and comes to a grand total of 46 euros. Seriously - a house-made, purley delicious and totally authentic Spanish meat and cheese fest for two for under 50 euros. Total. How can you not love that?Since it's a pretty popular spot and it can be tricky to get a table, we immediately made a reservation to come back later in the week, and we looked forward to going back all week. Everyday. And no other meal in any other restaurant measured up to either of those we had a Recasens. Don't miss out, kids - it's sensational.",
