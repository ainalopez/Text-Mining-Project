    "The highlight of my trip to Barcelona. \u00a0Gaudi and La Rambla were great, but sampling the local food is what it's all about. \u00a0The place is standing room only, and as you can see from the pictures and from other reviews, it gets pretty crowded. \u00a0The tapas and cava are priced low enough that you can be here for hours sampling all that they have.All their tapas were great, had the xistorra, cheese plates, along w/ a foie gras sandwich, of which they gave a pretty generous portion. \u00a0The atmosphere and food of this place is one-of-a-kind, truly a destination spot if you're in Barcelona.",
