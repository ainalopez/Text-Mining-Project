    "We had a terrible experience here. We read the reviews and instantly cued in line. There seemed to be no system for keeping track of who arrived when. The waitress came out, asked our name and told us it would be 40 minutes. We eagerly waited and made friends with some of the other people around us. After 40 minutes everyone we were originally standing with had been seated inside. A new wave of people started to arrive. We thought we must be next. We patiently waited another 20 minutes, and we started seeing people that arrived after us go in and be seated. This continued again and again. We confronted the waitress and asked her where we were on the list. She became defensive and said she hadn't had a table for 3 people (and clearly she wasn't making any effort). After an hour and twenty minutes waiting, we were hungry, frustrated and ready to leave. We asked her how much longer it would be. She got defensive and then could not even give us an answer - as if it could be longer! Even other people in line realized what was happening and offered their place to us. I'd hate to think it was because we were American but she clearly had some issue.",
