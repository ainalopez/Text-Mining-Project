    "We ordered a mixed platter of local specialties, a tenderloin sirloin and some cava. All was obviously tapas size, but tasting excellent. Particularly the sirloin, which is a delicatessen in Spain. Decoration is cool, music in the background, waiter are youngsters dressed in black and atmosphere is quite relaxed, full of tourists. If you are looking for a good tapas bar, it is worth the stop.",
