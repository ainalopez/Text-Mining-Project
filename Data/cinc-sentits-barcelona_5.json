    "This is a great activity dinner...you must be a foodie to appreciate. \u00a0Really interesting presentation of everything with a huge focus on Catalonia wine and food...Lorena is one of the unique wait staff in the world that is so passionate about her job it's inspiring. \u00a0The service was outstanding...if you've never seen a napkin perfectly folded using only a spoon and fork, you're in for a treat. \u00a0You'll also get a history lesson on Catalan food with excellent presentation. \u00a0Our only complaint and reason for 4 stars was the wine pairing. \u00a0Almost exclusively wines from Catalonia, they were definitely underwhelming with the sherry not really drinkable (I admit I'm not a sherry guy). \u00a0Not cheap but definitely unique.",
