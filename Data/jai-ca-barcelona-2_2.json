    "Been there a couple of times and I like the blend of tourists and locals. The portions are of a good size and you have the option of ordering a full or a half portion. Prices are reasonable too. Meatballs were outstanding but the seafood tapas were OK. Customer service needs a bit of improvement.It is fun for a vermut and few tapas.",
