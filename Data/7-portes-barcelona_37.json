    "Our hotel was situated not to far from this restaurant so we decided to come in for dinner. I am absolutely glad we came, the building itself is very quaint and beautiful. We came on a Tuesday evening around 9:30pm and it was very busy. They had a bartender making cocktails outside while we waited so I ordered a cucumber henderick's gin and my boyfriend ordered a beer. My drink was nice and strong, around 8 euros, which is reasonable for a cocktail. The bartender carved out a piece of cucumber skin and put into the glass, the attention to detail while he was making the cocktail was impressive. We waited for about 30 minutes and got seated outside their patio dining area. We really took our time here and enjoyed each and every dish, the portions are large so we shared everything. We ordered 3 dishes which consisted of the noodle paella, roasted chicken and a fish dish, I can't remember the name. Everything was delicious, seasoned just right and not overbearingly salty as what I am use to here in the states. We probably would have been fine ordering two dishes to share, 3 was a bit much, which left us too full to order dessert, bummer! Our bill came out to around $100 with 3 dishes and 2 cocktails and a small bottle of wine. We both agreed this was probably one of our most enjoyable dining experiences while we were in Spain. I will return here if I ever visit Barcelona again. :)",
