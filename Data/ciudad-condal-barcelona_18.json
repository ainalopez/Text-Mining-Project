    "We were a bit skeptical bc there were some mixed reviews, but thankfully we were very pleased with our meal. This place is definitely worth a visit. \u00a0As other have mentioned, the lines move fairly quickly so don't let the lines turn you away. We went as just a party of two, which helped us get seated quicker as well. We got an English menu, but they don't really highlight the daily specials on there, so make sure to ask about them because there are some good eats on there as well!Between my husband and I, we shared our dishes. The bravas potatoes were very good, with a crisp outside and soft hot inside, with a lot of aioli mayo on top and another red dipping sauce that was the best part. The croquette was ok but nothing great, as were the mushrooms and asparagus. But our favorite was the seafood! Grilled cuttlefish was perfectly lightly seasoned with a butter sauce and lemon. We also got a daily special of octopus, the \"tapita de pulpo\" with perfectly done octopus seasoned with paprika. Great! We topped it off with dessert with chocolate cake and their version of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e - these were good but not the best I've had. Service was pretty good - don't expect top notch or anything, but our waiter was perfectly fine and spoke English well. Overall was a highlight in our trip!",
