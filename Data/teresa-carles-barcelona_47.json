    "After an enjoyable experience at the sister restaurant, we were looking forward to try Teresa Carles. As a party of 2 adults and 1 child, we arrived at 12:30 on Sunday lunchtime. Got told there would be a 15 minute wait: ok, no problem with that especially given the day. After that time, we get offered a shared table (ok again) and are brought to an absolutely empty dining room (so why make us wait in the first place?). We have no problem with a shared table but it was directly under an air vent blowing cold air (on an already chilly February day). Before being seated, our daughter complained about the cold. Since dining with jackets wasn't our idea of fun, we requested another table and the response, with a lot of attitude, was only if we promised \u00a0to finish in 1hr15 (clearly some tables were marked with reserved birds but many others were not). They didn't want to seat 2 adults and a young child (who would also be eating) at a normal table of 3 or 4. This was the least family friendly experience we have had in Barcelona.",
