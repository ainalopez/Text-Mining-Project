    "My best friend and I came here 'cause it was cheap. We were visiting Barcelona for Primavera 2014 and came across this place on yelp. Coming from Vancouver, BC CANADA where there are barely any Mexican eateries (that are really good) we were really looking forward to this place. As tourists with an agenda and schedule we specifically planned to come here on the only day that we could, however, they closed earlier than advertised with no hours posted or notice of early closure. Very disappointing. This is in a high tourist area with good reviews, therefore, you would think that they would want to inform current and future customers. I get it, sh*t happens, just let us know what is going on. If you've changed your hours than update this and your web page.",
