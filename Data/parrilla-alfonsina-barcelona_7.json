    "First, the level of service -- even for Barcelona's standards -- is much to be desired. The waitress was kind, but it took over 45 minutes for a simple salad to be served. We also ordered a short rib, which was tasty, but it took close to 50 minutes to be ready. And a 300 gr (probably with the bones) for around 15-16 euros doesn't offer much value for money. There are way better options and much more value for money spots in Barcelona for these prices.",
