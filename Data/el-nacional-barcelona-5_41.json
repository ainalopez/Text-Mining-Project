    "I liked this place a lot! The ambiance is good. Its just packed. You must go to La Taperia. Its very nice, they are not the best tapas I've \u00a0had but they are fairly good and its a good experience to eat there. The whole mercado is beautiful! The staff were great! Have the pan con chocolate, sal y aceite de oliva!",
