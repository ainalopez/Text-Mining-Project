    "Awesome lunch spot in Barcelona especially if you need a break from paella and tapas. The burgers are huge, full of flavor, and really messy. I had the La Bacoa burger which has smoked bacon, Irish cheddar cheese, Manchego semi cured cheese and artisan spicy mustard. Every bite was pure heaven. My wife had the Manchego burger which is a Manchego cheese burger with caramelized onions. She said her burger patty was under cooked and too pink in the middle but I was so into my own perfectly cooked burger I basically ignored her and kept eating.",
