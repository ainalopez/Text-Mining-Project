    "The pulpo and tuna tar tar were great. The drinks were ok. The service was awful. But that doesn't surprise me in Barcelona, staff can be rude and inattentive more often than you think. Servers seemed bothered by people at the bar. A few of my orders went ignored. Cute place, didn't love the neighborhood. I wouldn't come back but the place was jam packed with Americans who were probably in Barcelona for the first time.. If this is your first time in the city you might enjoy it...",
