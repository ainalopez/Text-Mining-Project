    "Call ahead for reservations. Good service. Nice people. Steak with Roquefort cheese was decent. Seafood paella (the only paella I had on my vacation) was way too salty. Wanted it to be good. Had the Sangria and was also disappointed. Wanted so much to love this place. I've had better paella and Sangria in Vegas.",
