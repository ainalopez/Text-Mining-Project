    "Good place to have drinks, the tamarind margaritas are delicious especially with the rim mix. The food is ok nothing special, I had the nachos and the enchiladas Rojas. For the nachos they use a cheese sauce which isn't bad but it's too much. The enchiladas Rojas come with salad, rice, beans and guacamole but the red sauce has a strange taste and the guacamole needs more seasoning. The servers are nice and the place is nicely decorated. The prices are affordable, which is differently a plus in Barcelona.",
