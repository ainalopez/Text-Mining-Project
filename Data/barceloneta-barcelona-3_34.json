    "This bayside seafood eatery was recommended by a coworker, much to my wife's and my own delight it was absolutely delicious. We booked our reservation a mere 45 minutes before arriving on a Thursday night at a quarter to 11 with no problem whatsoever. The dining space is quite large with charming patio seating along the waterfront.For starters, my wife and I shared caracoles del mar (sea snails), a phenomenal appetizer (especially if you enjoy things like sea urchin) as well as the fried calamari legs. The lightly battered calamari was hands down the best I've ever tried (it's in another league altogether). For mains we shared a house specialty: Arroz Negro (rice in a squid ink sauce). Words cannot describe how good this dish was! It had a bevy of squid mixed in and was served with what was easily the best aioli I've ever tried! In addition we shared their bountiful seafood paella (how they cook their rice so perfectly I have no idea). The service was superb: when our two main dishes arrived, our server (in suit and tie) portioned out the plates delicately and with care, making sure to provide us each with a sizable langoustine or large prawn in the center respectively. He was highly knowledgable in Spanish wines and made a great recommendation on a bottle of white to compliment our meal.A perfect first meal in Barcelona, showing off what they do best. I will pay it forward and recommend this to any seafood lovers who find themselves in the area!",
