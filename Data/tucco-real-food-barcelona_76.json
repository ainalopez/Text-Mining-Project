    "A friend and I backpacking in Europe came here on our first day in Barcelona. It was so good we made sure to come back again before we left. Ravioli, beer, and dessert for under 8 euros. We tried the local Spanish food here and honestly this was still our favorite place we tried. The Argentian guys here really know how to do pasta right. This has become a must stop recommendation for anyone visiting Barcelona, you're missing out if you don't drop by.",
