    "Good for brunch/lunch, stay home for dinner. I went with a few co-workers for lunch and it was mind blowing good - as in Southern California Mexico flavor good. I was shocked, even my Spaniard co-worker who lived a number of years on the Yucatan side of Mexico was surprise on the familiar Mexican flavors that one just doesn't come across in Barcelona. Everything was perfect about it. They advertise as brewing their own beer, which was okay. Curing their own meat - that was good. And, bottling their own soda products - which tasted good but it all had a flavor of ginger in it. For that same reason, I then took my wife to dinner a few days later. Unfortunately, it was severely underwhelming. Tacos were cold, tasted lifeless, even the desert missed the same beat as during lunch hour.Recommend: Visit during the day time hours - the menus are different and the flavors seem to be on this menu (opposed to the night menu).",
