    "Great food. We had a party of four and had some fabulous dishes.mi started with the lobster salad. Simply delicious. Others had the white beans, beef cheeks- marinated in red wine for hours and slow cooked. Desserts included baked apple and other delectable items. Not cheap, but great attentive service and definitely a place to consider for a special night out.",
