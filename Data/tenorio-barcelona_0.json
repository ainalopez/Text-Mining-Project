    "Solid 4 stars. \u00a0Starting with the tomato basted grilled bread was great. \u00a0Mussels were on the good side of average... Dip the bread in the sauce. \u00a0Calamari was fresh and lightly breaded. \u00a0I like mine a little more flavorful, but if you like simple and fresh you will like this calamari. The soggy lobster rice was very good and the seafood paella was the best we had during our Barcelona stay. \u00a0Would easily go back anytime in the area.",
