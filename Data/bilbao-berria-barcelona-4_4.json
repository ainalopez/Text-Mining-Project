    "I love these types of tapas where you pick and choose what you want. Wish we had this here in Las Palmas. They have a beautiful selection of tapas for a really reasonable price. And a nice selection of wines. We were lucky to find a seat, as the place was pretty full. The food was awesome, I would happily come back here upon a return to barcelona!",
