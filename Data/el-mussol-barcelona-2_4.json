    "A friend that lives in Barcelona took me there and more than once during my one-week stay in Barcelona. It's a great place, prices are lower than what I'm used to pay for a good restaurant, the service is perfect and the menu is large enough for anyone to enjoy the place. The decoration is also super awesome. Go there if you're visiting Barcelona, they have 5 restaurants in the city and one at the airport!",
