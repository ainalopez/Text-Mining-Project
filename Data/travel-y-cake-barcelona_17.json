    "Hands down the best breakfast we had while in Barcelona. My wife and I are from California and were missing a taste of breakfast from back home after being away almost 2.5 weeks. Even though this wasn't exactly our typical breakfast it did not disappoint. We had the potato scrambled eggs with Iberian ham on focaccia toast, mimosa, vanilla latte and for dessert a chocolate crisp donut with cream filling. All I have to say is AMAZING!!!! This place is definetly a must when in Barcelona. Also if your into organic food most of their dishes are made from organic products",
