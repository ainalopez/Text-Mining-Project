    "Tapas 24 is a great choice if you're ever in BCN. One dish that takes the cake is the quail legs - perfection. Quail legs can be dry and game-y, but this was not the case. That salty sweet sauce is addicting! I also recommend the \"bikini\" - a black truffle, cheese and ham sandwich. Lamb skewers were well seasoned and well-cooked. The foie gras burger was essentially a plain hamburger with foie gras butter accompaniment. The burger itself was moist and flavorful, even more so when you add in the foie butter. On that note: I love foie gras, but the french fries topped with egg and foie gras can be skipped. The fries were soggy, and the dish overall was oily and lacked salt. They are very busy, but both times we came, we were able to be seated within 20 minutes. With that said, this isn't the kind of restaurant you go to for fine-dining service. The waiters are constantly running the food and taking orders, but we received everything we needed, and never felt neglected. Protip: if you're dining outside, in a table closest to the sidewalk, be aware of your wallets/ purses/ phone. The waiter kindly reminded us when we sat down. Better safe than sorry :)",
