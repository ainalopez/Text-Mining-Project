    "My best tapas in Barcelona! Of course the bombetas are amazing or as they would call them \"cojonudas\"! But there is so much more than that on this menu. Incredibly tasty Spanish dishes such as callos a la madrile\u00f1a, octopus a la gallega, pimientos, chorizo al vino, Spanish tortillas, gambas al ajillo etc. They also have lots of great Spanish wines as well as Ca\u00f1as (beers). The ambiance is super casual and authentic. Absolutely loved this place!",
