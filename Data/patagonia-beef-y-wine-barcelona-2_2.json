    "After searching high and low for a nice Argentinian steak house we came across Patagonia beef and wine and it certainly didn't disappoint! As it was around the corner from Catalonia square it was ideal and easy to get too. It was easily one of the best steaks I have had and was cooked to perfection, so if your struggling to find somewhere to eat I would highly recommend to go here!!",
