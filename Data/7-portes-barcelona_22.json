    "I came here for their paella and I was impressed! \u00a0 The ambience was old-school and traditional but very charming. \u00a0They have several big dining areas so coming here for lunch had no wait! \u00a0We had the house white wine and it was refreshing and crisp. \u00a0The steamed mussels mariner style were extremely fresh and each mussel was just cooked right and humongous. \u00a0The fish-only paella was heavenly with every grain of rice standing on its own and not mushy at all. \u00a0The sauce was not too rich or salty. \u00a0The seafood are all very fresh and plentiful. \u00a0 It indeed lived up to its reputation of having one of the best paella in Barcelona.",
