    "This was probably the best tapas experience we had during our visit to Barcelona. We tried their Papitu beer which was really good. The service was friendly and they provided great recommendations. Our favorite tapa was definitely their chicken croquetas. They were amazing! Perfectly crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The zetas (mushroom) croquetas were also good. Their pan con tomate was also yummy. My favorite pan con tomate out of all the tapas restaurants we tried. We had it with the traditional iberico ham and cheese. Also suggest for you to try their carne con tomate. We also tried a seafood platter that was amazing, but a little pricey. Definitely recommend this hidden gem.",
