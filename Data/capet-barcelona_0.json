    "So you're staying in the Gracia neighborhood and you want great food and great service- go to Capet. It's a Friday night and the neighborhood is busy. We've been here a week, and have walked by Capet every day on the way to the Fontana metro stop. We see the staff having a meeting one day and say hmmm that's a good sign! After a day of sightseeing we called for a reservation (we used Skype), and a Friday, no less. We had to sit at the bar when they opened at 8:30pm, but, yeah that's ok! Not many tables here! Do you want me to go in to the food? You'll be fine. English and Spanish menus. I uploaded my pics of some of the dishes we ate and a glimpse of the kitchen.It is important to note that the kitchen is probably 8x8. Three chefs. Two waitresses. But they are one intertwined machine! Awesome work! Small plate fresh cuisine that is easy to share.On a final note I'll add that the 10pm crowd showed up for their tables, and waited patiently. Another sign of good food.",
