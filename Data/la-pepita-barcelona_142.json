    "Best tapas we had while in Barcelona. \u00a0We left it for the last night as it is a bit more pricey than the other places we ate, but well worth it. \u00a0The atmosphere was great and some of the tapas were quite interesting and contemproary! \u00a0Of course, the pepita sandwhiches were a must as well, but loved the tapas. \u00a0Great place well worth the buzz.",
