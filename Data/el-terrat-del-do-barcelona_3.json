    "This may have been the only restaurant on the plaza that did NOT have a person outside working to drag you in. That always seems suspect. \u00a0This place is the terrace of a nice looking hotel, and we decided to give it a try. Our starters were fantastic (little bacalao croquettes and terrific foie gras terrine with an onion and sweet wine jam). \u00a0And now comes the lobster paella - which was really expensive and really awful - really overcooked lobster, chewy and dry, in a disgusting pasty rice. \u00a0I am sad that the lobster died for this mess. I would've rated this place 4 stars at least for tapas - but stay away from that paella.",
