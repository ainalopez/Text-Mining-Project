    "Was so sad I only found this place on my second to last night in Barcelona because it was just that good. The menu is happily simple - 4 items, 1 of each. So if you get the burger (delectable choice by the way), there's only one kind. The Chivou's kind. Better Philly cheese steaks than any I've had in Philly. The chivou's-style papas (aka covered in queso and bacon bits) are a must - even for the extra \u20ac0.90. Just do it. Don't shortchange yourself. Funky atmosphere with a signature doodled wall that's kind of trippy but cool. Would go again for sure!",
