    "True story. I spent a good 9 months in and out of Barcelona and found this place the first time and have gone back at least once every time since. If you like Mexican food \u00a0and cocktails you must go here. Everything is good; eat and drink it all. I suggest a michalada and a quesadilla and nachos to share. Tell Pepe Jack from Arizona says hi.",
