    "Wow! \u00a0My husband and daughters and I had the surprise pleasure of dining at Embat our last night in Barcelona. \u00a0Embat had been recommended to my husband by the wine shop where he had spent some time buying wonderful Spanish wine we can't find in the US. We were visiting our older daughter who was studying there and had had several months to find several great spots for eating that she had shared with us but even after 8 days of putting much emphasis on our culinary experience in Barcelona, my daughter exclaimed after trying her Salmon Tartare, this is now my favorite restaurant in Barcelona! We also had the starter of grilled octopus with an Asian influence( we loved it so much we ordered a 2nd one). \u00a0My husband had the wild boar terrine which was fantastic. They handled a nut allergy and special request very graciously and thoughtfully. \u00a0There were not a lot of people there when we were there on a Friday night and I truly don't understand why. \u00a0If you don't try it you will be missing out! \u00a0This place is a gem! \u00a0Go!",
