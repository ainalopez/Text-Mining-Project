    "House cava, Yes please !! Their cava is just mouthwatering and best I've tried by far. It's madness inside and -- to no surprise -- the place is packed within minutes their door opens. Located in the heart of El Born, on the same block as Picasso museum, it is definitely a must while in Barcelona. I can't even handpick anything from food because it's all pretty outstanding. You'll see dozens of pinxtos and marinated seafood variety, and there is a whole hot dish menu not to be missed, with Catalan specialties like snails and rabbit.",
