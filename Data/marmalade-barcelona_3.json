    "Arrived here for brunch around noon and the restaurant was nearly empty. We were immediately greeted and sat inside opposite the bar. We ordered from the brunch menu. My girlfriend had the triple whammy burger and I had the eggs Benedict. With this entr\u00e9e you can also get a drink and desert for around 9.50\u20ac each.We were both extremely satisfied with the meal and would go back if we had more time to stay in Barcelona. You can't go wrong here.",
