    "Amazing ambiance and food. Handmade pasta, fresh salads. Both husband and I ate a full blown 3 course meal under $20 dollars. Local hipsters, but all polite and welcoming. I can't wait to come back and tell my friends about this place. Their pasta is fresh, and really is setting the bar for my trip to Italy.",
