    "My wife and I both agreed this was the worst place we ate in all of Barcelona, and even perhaps elsewhere. We were quite bummed and are still in shock that it received as many good reviews as it has. The food was 1 star and it is completely overpriced. We ordered an entree with Salt Cod that was not only lacking of any real flavor, but was served in some type of sauce that would have been more appropriate for Chef Boy R Dee. Also it came with only a spoon full of white beans on the side, which we thought was a joke. The Apsaragus appetizer was also horrible. We think it actually came from a can which would be a first for us. The Spinach appetizer was ok but there was just no flavor in anything we had. The wine and the water were the highlights. A neighboring table got a salad which we noticed was 10+ euros on the menu and it was a pile of leaf lettuce. No color whatsoever. Our bill came to 65 Euros before the tip. By far the worst money spent on our whole trip to Spain. The service here was good but the atmosphere a little stuffy. Fyi everywhere else we ate in the city was great.",
