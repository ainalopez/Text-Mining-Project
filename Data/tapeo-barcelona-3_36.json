    "Very small establishment with extremely limited seating. Highly suggest making reservations. We had to wait about 2 hrs for a table after putting our name down so we went elsewhere for some wine to kill sometime.

I personally didn't care for them because I do like game meat and didn't want just batter. The Sardine Coca Cake only has two sardines on a long piece of bread so you may need to order more than one if you have more than 2 people. There was four of us, but we were fine with a small taste since we had planned on ordering a variety of dishes. We all did enjoy them tho. The eggs in the Truffled Eggs w/ Foie Gras & Mushrooms were poached so the runny yolk was great with the foie gras & mushrooms. Very earthy dish. The oxtail was the favorite dish because it was so tender and loaded with flavor. The Pork Ribs were on the sweet side and also tender. The Stewed Beef Cheek was also very tender and probably another favorite of the group. The Canelloni wasn't very memorable since it wasn't bad or good. Just ok.Service was friendly. Since we came closer to closing time, we didn't feel as rushed from our table (plus we were seated in the middle nook by the kitchen where people can't see you from the front so that helped).Great food. Doesn't beat El Xampanyet (in our opinion) since it is a little bit more expensive but it does have a wider variety. We also thought that El Xampanyet was more lively and fun. Still a great tapas spot! Our 2nd favorite of all the places we tried.",
