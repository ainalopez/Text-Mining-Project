    "There are lots of good things about this place and some not so good things, so while I'm putting down three stars, I'm verging more towards 2.5. Of the good things, right off the bat, I went in fairly late to have a nice dinner (around 11-12) and while there was a long line it actually moved forward fairly quickly and the wait was probably under half an hour. There was some debate as to how fresh the seafood was. My personal opinion is that everything tasted good and was seasoned well but that they tend to undercook (to my taste) slightly leaving things a bit softer as opposed to overcooking. Also, it might have just been that they were so busy they just tossed things on the grill until they were past the point of being raw. My advice is to ask for a menu written in whatever language you speak. They probably have it as this restaurant is situated near some hotels and a lot of tourists seemed to be there. Order product (fish, shrimp, vegetables, squid, etc.) as opposed to trying to wander through the menu unless you know what you want. It was very affordable. For 3 people with maybe 6-7 small plates tapas style it came out to around 60 euros. Everything was fairly average. The place is a little loud. It's not exactly fine dining. Everything's a little crowded. If you try and get up from the table to use the restroom or leave the restaurant you run the risk of being run over by a waiter. If you can deal with that, then this place is a nice, affordable choice.",
