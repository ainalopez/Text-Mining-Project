    "You could get away with just writing two words as a review for this place and everyone would know what to expect.\u00b4\u00b4 Mason Jars\u00b4\u00b4But you would be doing it an injustice, as much as my anti-hipster devil on my shoulder is pushing me to...Its what a modern city with such creative and artistic vibes running through the city needs, what arrives in front of you is much the same.I was there to experience the brunch menu and was fortunate enough to sit at the bar where all the food is cooked. The two chefs on show, working great together, hiding nothing, well... because theres no where to hide.The brunch staples flying out, huevous rancherous, eggs benidict, pulled pork, each with its own modern twist, the duck hash is on the list for next time.Its a \u00a0busy place, im mean rammed i spoke to the chef and he gave me an insight to an average days covers,how he keeps the continuity and quality i dont know,but if i remember right, he actually said, \u00b4\u00b4we dont forget to have fun! \u00b4\u00b4But get there early or book a table, i saw a lot of dissappointed faces walk away, dont be next !",
