    "My fiance and I ate here on a Thursday evening, based on the excellent Yelp reviews. We weren't disappointed. We had the ravioli special, which came with an empanada, the vegetable lasagna, a chocolate brownie, and cheese cake. Total cost for the meal was under twenty euros, and it also included bread and a glass of wine for each of us.The ham, cheese, and olive empanada was warm and yummy, redolent with tastes of the fresh cheese and olives. The home made ravioli had a blend of cheese and pistachios wrapped in \u00a0green pasta. It was light and airy. Quite possibly the best ravioli we've ever eaten. And then came the vegetable lasagna... House made pasta, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, walnuts, fresh tomato sauce \u00a0- those were the ingredients we could identify. And they worked wonderfully together. The walnuts gave the dish an unexpected crunch and added to the overall flavor. My fiance and I both agreed that this was the best vegetable lasagna....ever.The desserts and bread were great, too. But we left our second stomachs back in the hotel room \u00a0and couldn't eat them all. The brownie is definitely a \u00a0keeper.The service matched the food. Very friendly, lots of smiles, attentive but not intrusive. This gem of a restaurant is hard to find, but so worth the search. We'll be back when we visit Barcelona again.",
