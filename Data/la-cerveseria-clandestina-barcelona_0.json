    "Do yourself a favour and get the patatas bravas. Burgers are also delicious-- but be warned, if you're not from the area-- they will cook it rare to medium-rare.Gets super busy after 7:30-8 p.m. and I believe the cook doesn't arrive until around that time, so be sure to keep that in mind. Great location and great food-- get down here and try it out!",
