    "What can I say... If you believed some (most of) the ratings, you'd think this place was a 3-4 star. \u00a0It's not that it doesn't live up to those claims, it's that my experience was SO far off from them that it causes me to write a review (which I rarely do) in the first place. \"Steak\" (curiously tasting like boiled ham) was fatty, as in 2/3rds of it \u00a0and smothered in a milk/cream -based sauce. Not very appetizing. Dessert crepe tasted like a tortilla and our coffees (plural) was a singular (one). The lack of attention to anything caused us to leave the coffee on the table as we ordered decaf and, based on the rest of the experience, knew it wasn't. We wanted nothing more than to just leave. \u00a0My wife wants to make sure I add her input which had to be edited for the \"colorful\" language... \"Who brings you the wrong order, tells you they're sorry for the wrong item and still freaking charges you for the wrong order? \u00a0Who freaking does that?? \u00a0The look of confusion on the waitresses face. WHO WE JUST GAVE THE ORDER TO, was more annoying than the entire incident.\" \u00a0It was at that point where she decided the entire restaurant had it in for her and we decided to get the hell out of there before they poisoned her.***It's now an hour later, we're back in the hotel and she's STILL bitching about it. \u00a0She's telling me I better post this damn review or she's going to smother me in my sleep.",
