    "LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I know you are supposed to try different places when you go on vacation but my parents and I ended up going back here for breakfast lunch and dinner! AMAZING tapas. It is right off La Rambla but is not at all touristy or poor quality like a lot of the other restaurants around there. Great atmosphere with quirky and interesting decor. I particularly enjoyed the fried artichokes, the patatas bravas, and the fried eggplant with honey. They also make a great cappuccino.",
