    "This is a tiny tapas bar right near the Picasso Museum. \u00a0We were really lucky to snag a table way in the back of this place, as seating is very limited. \u00a0Service was friendly and they tried very hard to describe each item in english. \u00a0You order at the bar, and they will bring you your selections to your table. \u00a0The food was pretty good. \u00a0We had some tasty cheese, meats, and veggie dishes. \u00a0I particularly liked the roasted potatoes with garlic mayo and mini cheese stuffed red bell peppers.The food was good, but I'm not sure I can justify the prices being so high. \u00a0We were shocked at how much the bill came out to. \u00a0I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's a decent option if you're nearby exploring the gothic quarter and need a place to eat.",
