    "So happy I found this place. It reminded me of an LA breakfast, but better quality and nicer environment.I got the toast with almond butter and Chia pudding. At first I thought the almond butter was like peanut butter, but no, it's actually Almond. Butter. I thought it was a little too sweet, but still delicious.My mom got the Eggs Benedict with salmon on a hot dog bun and she said it was the best she's had. The flavors were perfect, one flavor was not overwhelming. Dad got the French Toast that he loved, but thought was also a little too sweet. We loved that they make designs on the coffee :)Hopefully I'll be able to come back at least one more time!",
