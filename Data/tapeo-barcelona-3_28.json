    "I let my husband choose-and it was so great my head exploded with jealousy. \u00a0My Spanish is a mix of jumbled English and French-so let's not mention Catal\u00e1-however the surly-at-first waitress was into speaking English-so I rolled with it.Cannelloni with truffled sausage-do it twiceFideua with sepia ink-do it and do it with the aioliSkirt steak with chimichurri-the doneness was terrific, the sauce was mehTortilla con chorizo-do it twice.Service was rapid as was turnover-sit at the bar...They made us, but it's the same great food!! No fotos bc you'll be stuffing your face.",
