    "This place is an experience! Fish market in front, full-fledged restaurant operation just behind. You first form a line leading to the counter, where you then buy seafood *by weight*, specify how you would like it cooked, then pay and sit at a table while your food is prepared.For four people, we ate for around 60 USD, which included:- Two larges plates of calamari- Grilled octopus- Alaskan Crab- Steamed clams- A large serving of prawnsand a few other basic types of fish.The food was fresher than any restaurant I've been to (I mean, you choose your own and they cook it for you, how much better does life get?) and full of flavour.",
