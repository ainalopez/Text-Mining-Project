    "My first night in Barcelona I had to have at least a beer with my cousin Jorge who lives there. My AirBNB apartment was just above a bar and restaurant called Tapa Tapa (Passeig de Gracia 44, 08007).Jorge met me there and we enjoyed conversation over a couple of large San Miguel beers in the sidewalk seating area. It was a perfect spot to chat and people-watch as the night grew later and later. The weather was great in late-November too.This is a great spot for drinking, relaxing, and enjoying a conversation.",
