    "Expensive tapas, yet many are made from canned food straight from the can. In the case of the tuna, \u00a0they just scooped straight onto your plate. Ditto the mussels. I could deal with this if they did something creative with the canned product, but often it was sit on top of ordinary bread with little fanfare. You can find much better in the area at the same price or less.",
