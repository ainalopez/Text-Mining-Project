    "Cozy place, nice ambiance and exceptional service! The food was very good too. They have pinchos displayed, but we went for the tapas on the menu. The best chorizo a la sidra (pork sausages cooked in cider)- highly recommend it. Plus, the price was reasonable (not high at all for the area it's located in).",
