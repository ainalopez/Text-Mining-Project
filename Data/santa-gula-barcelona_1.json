    "Wow, this was the best place I've eaten in Barcelona. I found this place while doing some research on instagram and this place did not disappoint. First was the Burrata cheese starter (this was gastronomically MIND BLOWING!), followed by the home made ravioli (shrimp and mushrooms were cooked perfectly), and because I knew I wouldn't have a chance to come again, I opted to get 1 more dish (the deboned pigs feet stuffed with shrimp). Yes, I was being greedy but if I had the option, I would do a couple of stretches, a bit of jumping jacks just so I could make room for another couple of dishes.",
