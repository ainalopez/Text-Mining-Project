    "Tapas were fabulous in Spain, but after many a tapas filled day it was nice to try something different. \u00a0I believe this is one of many locations in Spain (or at least Barcelona). \u00a0Staff was very friendly, lively atmosphere, and although the combinations of ingredients were a little strange to me (maybe more authentic? \u00a0not sure but definitely not what I am used to seeing in the US) the ravioli and the pizza we had were delicious. \u00a0The highlight for me was the homemade cheesecake - again, different from what I am used to when ordering cheesecake but so delicious. \u00a0It was the consistency of yogurt, served in a glass with some berries on the bottom and graham cracker type cookie pieces. \u00a0Our waiter spoke English pretty well and the bill for 2 including the pizza, ravioli, cheesecake dessert, and a glass of wine came to only 37 euros.",
