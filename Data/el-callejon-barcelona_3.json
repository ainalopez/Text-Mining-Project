    "I stumbled across El Callejon whilst absolutely starving on my first night in Barcelona. I arrived around 8 so it was quiet then the restaurant gradually filled up around me.I ordered a steak which came with a salad and fried potatoes which was perfect washed down with an Estrella which was perfect. Absolutely nothing was wasted on the plate. I even ordered a chocolate brownie for dessert which also came with ice cream and was also delicious. The service was good and the whole bill came (just me) came to just over \u20ac20 which was outstanding value.",
