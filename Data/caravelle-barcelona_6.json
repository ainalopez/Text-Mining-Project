    "Best brunch I've had in Barcelona, even over some of the other highly recommended places I've been. Dirty chai latte was out of the park, as was the Huevos Rancheros which was their own take on this dish but I was everyone else did it this way! Also had the avocado toast with tomato and a poached egg, which I would also recommend. Good service overall, would 100% go back",
