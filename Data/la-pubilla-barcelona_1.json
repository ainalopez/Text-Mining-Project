    "This casual little eatery in the Gr\u00e0cia district was recommended by a friend as a place frequented by locals. We arrived around noon, and the attendant informed us in decent English that a table would come available at 1:00 PM, though we would only have an hour to eat. No problem: we passed the time by exploring a nearby market. Lunch follows a prix fixe format, where a very reasonable 15 euros lands you an appetizer, an entree, a dessert, and your choice of beverage (beer or wine included). In a testament to its authenticity, the menu is entirely in Catalan...my high-school level Spanish was of no use here. Thankfully, the waiter was more than willing to translate the descriptions as best he could. The gourmet preparations were fantastic, and the artful plating blew me away. My first course was a layered potato salad topped with onions, arugula, and thick, buttery slices of salmon. My brother's garlic-parmesan spaghetti with bacon was quite oily but satisfying, though I think I made the better choice. For the main event, I ordered the grilled veal liver mistakenly thinking it was a veal steak. Oh well, good thing I'm an adventurous eater. The chunks of liver were thin and flavorful, the tougher texture melding well with the juicy caramelized onions. If you're not familiar or comfortable with the idea/taste of liver, I would recommend the burger, which looked quite tasty. For dessert, I selected an airy whipped yogurt parfait with fruits. It was decent, although some magrana (pomegranate seeds) would have been undoubtedly refreshing after a rich meal. La Pubilla boasts some great service, beautiful presentation, and fascinating food. Certainly a must-try for foodies and/or those tired of picking at miniature tapas and pinchos.",
