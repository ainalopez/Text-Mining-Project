    "Great place for tapas. Very expensive fresh seafood. Check the prices before you order. 7 Prawns in garlic and olive oil was \u20ac36 and the fresh squid was also very expensive. At \u20ac130 for a lunch for 2 that was closer to top end Michelin prices not a neighborhood tapas bar. Would go back here again as the food is really good and the wine list is extensive. Not telling your customers up front how expensive your fresh seafood is a bit cheeky and unfair. Not telling them is not on.",
