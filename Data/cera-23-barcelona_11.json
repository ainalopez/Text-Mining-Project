    "I hate eating where tourists eat when traveling as I'd much rather eat where the locals eat. That's how I felt when eating here as everyone seemed to be from the states. With that being said, this was one of my better meals on my 3 week trip to Europe. The restaurant is kind of hidden and not on a main street. We walked in and were told we needed reservations and it was impossible to get a table, but we could sit at the bar and order from the same table menu which we elected to do. We went with the ceviche to start with, which was something like I've never had before. The flavor was unbelievable and the ingredients were super fresh. Went with the beef cheeks and potato puree, foie gras ravioli, and volcano rice which was like a squid ink rice. The rice was great and maybe the best rice I've ever had. Service at the bar was slow as there was only one person behind the bar on a Friday night. Regardless if this is a tourist spot or not, if you want a culinary experience for cheap, eat here.",
