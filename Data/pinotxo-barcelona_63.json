    "Man this bar gets packed! \u00a0And rightfully so. \u00a0The food here is awesome! \u00a0And, it probably helps that Pinotxo is exposed to pretty heavy foot traffic right near the entrance as people flow into La Boqueria. It's not hard to get discouraged by the hordes of hovering people, but with determination and patience, you just may snatch a spot at the bar or one of the few nearby tables. \u00a0After finally grabbing a seat at the bar, my hubby and I ordered a plate of venison and chicken. \u00a0We pretty much ordered by eyeing what was currently being prepared and what others were eating. \u00a0The chicken was not just your ordinary chicken. \u00a0I'm not sure exactly how it was cooked, but it was super juicy, tender, and flavorful. \u00a0The venison was also seasoned nicely and cooked to perfection. \u00a0 It was served on a skewer with a small side salad. \u00a0Not exactly cheap, but definitely worth the quality. \u00a0Highly recommended for a quick bite when you're visiting La Boqueria.",
