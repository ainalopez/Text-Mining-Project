    "This place has a great location near the Sagrada Familia. \u00a0The paella looked good but was sadly undercooked. \u00a0This was odd, since I looked over at the girl next to us, and her paella had that lovely layer of brown on the bottom of hers. \u00a0For ours, the rice was still a little raw in the middle, and there was a puddle of water at the bottom of our dish. No crispy bottom layer of rice. :( \u00a0On the upside, the quality of the seafood was good, and the flavors were there - not too salty and perfectly golden in color. \u00a03.5/5Patatas bravas were not crispy and had a spicy red sauce on top. They were kind of like sad cafeteria potatoes. \u00a03/5Meatballs were flavorful, in a tomato sauce, and tasted so good with the polenta we ordered. 4/5Polenta with mushrooms, mozzarella, and truffle oil was tasty and perfectly fluffy, and decadent in flavor. 5/5Kind of a hodgepodge, as the things I liked were fantastic and the things I didn't like were surprising letdowns. \u00a0This place appears to specialize in paella, so it was disappointing that it failed at the basics. \u00a0It ended up being the only paella we had in Spain. \u00a0Too bad.",
