    "Fabulous. \u00a0Great combination for a weary traveler. \u00a0Quality food and ingredients and a menu small but diverse enough to satisfy the fussy kid, the adventurous kid and the dad eager to sample Barcelona. \u00a0Possibly one of the best waitresses I've seen who handled a busy room with comfort and ease. \u00a0Definitely go.",
