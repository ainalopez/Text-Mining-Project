    "This place was a 20 minute walk from where we were staying. When we got there it was 10pm and there were a total of 4 people inside at one table. Our party was 4 as well and we just wanted a quick bite to eat. There were 2 tables outside that were not occupied but had they said they were reserved. We said that the bar seating would be fine but they said that was reserved too. Total bs in my opinion. We were in the area for 15 minutes and no one showed up. My guess is that after 10pm on a week day they don't feel like working anymore. In that case they should just say they are closed. I doubt the owner was there. I come to Barcelona often but this place will never get my money. No need to deal with liars when there are other options around.",
