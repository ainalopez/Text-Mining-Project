    "I have been a frequent customer of Bar Olimpia, right next door, and had always peeked over to see all the cool hip young kids in BCN hanging out at Jonny Aldana. \u00a0Indeed, until I stopped a few days ago, I was under the impression that these two businesses were related! \u00a0It turns out that Jonny Aldana stands on its own as a sweet spot for food and drink in hip Sant Antoni. \u00a0I went on a rainy Sunday afternoon. \u00a0The place was quiet, the decor incredibly cool, and the music even better. \u00a0Awesome! \u00a0The bar/cafe has a relatively extensive menu of sandwiches, tostas, tapas, and other light Mediterranean dishes, many of which looked absolutely fabulous! \u00a0I enjoyed a beer and a most wonderful tosta with eggplant samfaina, goat cheese, honey, sesame seeds, and balsamic reduction. \u00a0WOW! \u00a0I could eat 10,000 of those and still want more!Service was quite friendly and the restaurant/bar/cafe also boasts a window-bar and a lovely set of tables on the street for al fresco drinking and dining. \u00a0Really, I can find absolutely zero reasons not to give this place five stars...I can't wait to go back to try another fabulous dish and even some of their cocktails! \u00a0If you're looking for yet another sweet spot in Sant Antoni, Jonny Aldana is *definitely* a good pick. \u00a0See you there :)",
