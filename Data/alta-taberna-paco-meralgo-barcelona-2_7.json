    "This restaurant was highly recommended to us and gets excellent reviews so we were excited to get a reservation. \u00a0Let me begin with the positive aspects. \u00a0The restaurant is open past midnight on weekdays, which was great for us since we were waiting for friends to fly into Barcelona that evening. \u00a0It is a very lively place that appears to have remained popular for years (it was packed when we arrived at 11pm on a Thursday). \u00a0We really enjoyed the pan con tomate and the zucchini flowers... Unfortunately, this is where the good ends. \u00a0It was a disappointing evening to say the least. We expected the expensive menu but the portions were way too small. \u00a0The food was tasty so we had no problem just ordering more. \u00a0The problem was that our waiter was either too busy to serve us or could care less that we were there. \u00a0We did not expect him to understand much English but he was not patient at all as we tried to place our order. \u00a0It just felt as though he had more important things to do. \u00a0We were lucky to have a fluent Spanish speaker at the table but even she could barely finish her sentence before he ran away. \u00a0It was almost impossible to get drink refills or order more food. \u00a0Even when we did order another bottle of wine, it did not come until the end of our meal. \u00a0Of course, at this point, it looked like they were trying to close the restaurant so we almost felt uncomfortable hanging around to finish the wine.I like to give places the benefit of the doubt but after spending so much money, you at least expect to feel satisfied after a meal. \u00a0We just stopped ordering because it was so difficult to get any service. \u00a0This may have been the only evening of our trip when I felt as though I needed another meal.",
