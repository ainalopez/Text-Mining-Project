    "So lucky to have such a place right next to the apartment we are renting for our vacation in Barcelona. \u00a0Great for a drink and small bite before dinner.The atmosphere is very nice, small place though, so you may have to just stand with your drink in hand.So far the best sangria I had and they also have a nice selection of tapas, delicious and all at a very reasonable price. They have a huge selection of wines, and I saw people come and buy big jars of wine (the type you can refill I guess.)This Bodega is not in a touristy area and seems mostly visited by locals.We' ll be back tomorrow night....",
