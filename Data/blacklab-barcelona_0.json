    "Amazing. I had a pretty good idea about how Barcelona was a craft beer hotspot, and after trying out this amazing brewpub, I knew I had come to the right place. They do their own small batches right next to the pub, and boy are they good. I worked my way through their menu over the past week and was not disappointed once. Great IPA's, Porters, you name it. Fantastic!",
