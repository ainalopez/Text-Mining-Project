    "Mosquito is great...once you're in the door. I'm not sure I would repeat my experience there only because Barcelona will always be a vacation destination in my life (unfortunately!) and I probably wont choose to sacrifice so many hours waiting on line on my next trip. Once we were dining though everything was great. \u00a0The duck was awesome and a way larger portion than we were expecting. Dumplings were pretty good, and I am well versed in dumplings. Staff was a bit disorganized, resulting in multiple servers asking us the same questions over and over but overall the meal was great. The space is actually larger than it looks, and we found tables in the back room to be particularly spacious.",
