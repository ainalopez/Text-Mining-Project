    "My experience at Terra d'Escudella was a little confusing. But it was kind of my problem because I could not speak or understand Spanish... It was quite challenging. We were hungry and it was late. After trying to drop by a few places in the area and nothing really open for business, we decided to give Terra d'Escudella a try based on the 4 star rating on my Yelp App.Place was busy, which was a good sign! We quickly grabbed a table in front of the restaurant and thinking we can get some food and beers..and then we found out that all these people at the bar were waiting for a \"restaurant\" tables at the back!We ended up just have a quick beer and off we go to somewhere else for real food...PS they do have an English Menu",
