    "I love this small spot in the middle of the city. You will have to wait a little to get in here but it is really worth the wait. I totally recommend this place if you want to eat some Japanese food, specially sushi. Innovative and modern flavors is what you are going to find here. The staff is not the kindest you will ever meet, but still I go to eat to this restaurant quite often with my partner (who loves sushi as much or even more than myself). Be kind to the lady saving the door and she will be nice too, she can be a bit rude sometimes but don't take it personally, she is just like that. Once you get inside, you will notice there is just one Spanish waitress. Ask her everything you crave for, she is really nice. Also, I recommend this place for small groups or couples so you are able to sit at the \"running train\" bar, which is quite short but you will never miss a plate because they are always filling it with tons of food. If you are a bigger group, they will invite you to sit at a table so you can be more comfortable, but anyway you can ask everything you want and they will just bring big plates filled with different varieties of sushi, maki, uramaki and gunkan.",
