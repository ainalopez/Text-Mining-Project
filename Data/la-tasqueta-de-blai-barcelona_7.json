    "This was our first & last meal in Barcelona-- a nearly picture perfect experience. Such a great value for really tasty, great food. Must try once, at least.They had almost the same spread of pintxos both times, which was great because we knew what we preferred the second go around but it might have been nice to have a little more variety to try some new things. Not really a complaint though, there are so many to choose from.The soft cheese and raspberry jam with mint-- pleasure explosion for my mouth & brain! I really think this was what brought me back for the second visit. Their fried prawn/shrimp pintxos were my second favs. I will say that I did not care for the slider pintxos-- they lose appeal and flavor after they sit out as long as they do... and if Americans don't have standards for sliders, what else is left...I was awestruck the first visit. The second visit, I couldn't help but notice the obvious in what happens to food when it sits out for a bit, which is that it gets cold and loses some of its life. But it is what it is, doesn't bother me much for giant bites of variety for 2 euro each. This is my favorite style of eating-- little bits of different things, and delicious cheap beer and Spanish wine. How can you go wrong with a perfect glass of Rose for 3 euro to complement the smorgasbord?",
