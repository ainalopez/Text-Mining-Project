    "I hate that I ate here. Mostly because I'm now an entire continent away from a rendezvous with my favorite steak in the world.It's not just the romanticism of traveling abroad to a place like Barcelona that I make a claim like that. It's the best steak I've ever had in my life. They do something magical to a pile of meat and it happens right before your eyes. The process goes as such:1. You order a steak2. You indicate you'd like foie gras on said steak3. You order something to drink - a beer is most suitable 4. A man in a white coat retreats to the kitchen and returns behind the bar with a slab of red meat, a foie gras patty, and a bevy of raw white onions5. Meat cooks, onions caramelize, foie gras sears 6. The process is complete and you're handed a plate of simple culinary brillianceThe steak is best paired with the nature fat drippings it comes with naturally that collect at the bottom of your plate. It's more than enough to pack a flavorful punch. This will be a stop I make every time I visit Barcelona again in the future. It's divey, has a rich legacy, and is bloody delicious.",
