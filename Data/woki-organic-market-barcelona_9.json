    "This place was just what we needed. After a couple of days with disappointing reastaurant experinces in Barcelona, Woki was just outstanding. The food came quickly, and it tasted absolutely delicious. In addition to the restaurant, this place is also an organic market and bakery. It's impossible to enter this store without buying anything. The design and look of the place and the food on the shelves just makes you want to open your wallet and buy. An absolute must, if you find yoursef looking for some great-tasting, cheap food around Placa de Catalunya.",
