    "I came here to satisfy my craving for churros con chocolat after visiting La Sagrada Familia and was not disappointed. They had different types of churros from those stuffed with nutella, chocolate dulce de leche, and crema to those dipped in chocolate. They of course offered the regular churros I sought for which were made fresh to order. These had the right amount of crunch on the outside and softness on the inside to absorb the rich chocolate they freshly prepared. Overall it was heaven in my mouth! Now only if I can find a place like this stateside.",
