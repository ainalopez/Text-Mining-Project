    "1. This restaurant doesn't live up to the hype. Honestly, the sandwiches are not that great. The bread and meat are dry. You can get a better sandwich elsewhere without having to push and shove and get cava spilled all over you by other exasperated customers. The food is cheap for a reason: the portions are small, you can't sit down, and the service is essentially nonexistent. And it's unbearably hot inside in the summer.2. This restaurant discriminates against non-Spanish/Catalan speakers. Speaking in English, we tried to order a foie gras sandwich. The server tersely said they were out of foie gras. So we ordered something else. Then another customer, speaking in Spanish, ordered a foie gras sandwich. The server gave the customer a foie gras sandwich. When I asked the server why he said he was out of foie gras, he just shook his head and ignored us. Please don't let this restaurant ruin your Barcelona trip. It's just not worth it.",
