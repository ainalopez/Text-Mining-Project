    "Tasty food, good service but VERY expensive for what it was. I'd give 3.5 stars if I could. \u00a0For 4 people, our total was \u20ac221 not including tip. \u00a0We ate and drank well but based on our many other dining experiences in Spain, we could've done it for significantly less and eaten just as well. \u00a0If you are not on a budget, I would definitely recommend this spot for local experience with traditional Catalan cuisine. \u00a0Otherwise, perhaps go for lunch time based on the other review, or seek out a more affordable option.",
