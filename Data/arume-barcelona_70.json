    "The food was ok. We had some lamb, vegetable cannelloni, scallops, chorizo tacos, and a really good crumbly chocolate hazelnut ice cream dessert. Cocktails were excellent - a blackberry mojito and a coconut martini kind of thing. There are about a million restaurants here, and this place is kind of different from those traditional places. But I kind of wish I had worked through more traditional places before I came here.",
