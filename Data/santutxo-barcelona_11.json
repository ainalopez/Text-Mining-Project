    "So the owner/chef really tries but it's diminished by the waiter! Rude, uninterested, he came back 3 times empty handed and we waited for our wines about 15 minutes because it was crowded. Yes, there were 8 of us in total!? Food was, compared with other places we tried, not great - quality, quantity and choice wise. The rating is because of the chef but there are so many better places to try.",
