    "This might be the best meal I have ever had. Barcelona is food, and Elsa Y Fred defines this.If you want to do tapas here, you have to make reservations in advance. We went in on a Wednesday night around 5 (way earlier than most people do dinner!) and afterwards we saw a flood of people try to walk-in and were turned away.Ok, here is a complete list of the goodness that we ordered:1. Sangria--GET IT! So sweet it's like drinking juice. They even let you keep the bottle as a souvenir.2. Patatas bravas - amazingly roasted potatoes with a wonderful seasoned sauce. The best potatoes I have had in my life--our table ordered this three times.3. Coca bread with tomato paired with the plate of Iberian ham - I honestly really don't need to explain this one. Just get it. So much ham, but you can never have too much.4. Green salad with crispy brie and tomato jam - the brie was on point. Great option for vegetarians.5. Octopus dish (not sure if this was just a special or on the menu) - the squid was very well-cooked and fresh! Gotta get seafood in Barca.6. Pumpkin ravioli - LOVE pumpkin, LOVE ravioli. My friends weren't the biggest fans, but I could've eaten just this for a meal. Very light but also packed with flavor. The cheese really complements the pumpkin.7. Mushroom risotto flavored with white truffle - This was my friends' favorite dish! They pour the cream of mushroom on top of the plate in front of you. Excellent.This has been my favorite meal while abroad, and possibly in life. GO TO THIS PLACE IF YOU ARE IN BARCELONA! You will not regret it.",
