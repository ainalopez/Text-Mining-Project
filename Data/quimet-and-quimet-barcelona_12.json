    "Quimet & Quimet is ridiculous. I want to hate it so, SO much, but I cannot. Let me tell you why.No matter what time you get to Quimet & Quimet, even if you decide to go before it opens, there will be a line. Quimet & Quimet has been hyped SO much on Yelp and other food blogs that there's constantly a wait to get in.The place already is pretty tiny so do expect to be packed in like a can of sardines at Quimet & Quimet, hungrily munching on tapas. Like most popular tapas joints in Barcelona, YOU NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE. Before you do anything, you need to find a place to set your food down in order to be served. Don't be shy - ask people with tables if they can let you squeeze in. When ordering, don't be a jerk, but don't be a complete pushover either. Try to make eye contact with one of the people making the tapas who - by the way - are extraordinarily talented. It's incredible how they manage to not lose their temper with rude customers and how they make everything so quickly. The process of getting in and getting settled was probably the most frustrating part. But the frustration dissipated as soon as I took a bite out of the smoked salmon, yogurt and truffle honey tapa. Amazing. Sweet, smokey, fresh. Then another bite - Iberian pork cheek with potatoes. Unctuous, fatty, savory. And more bites - pat\u00e9, foie gras with mushrooms, shrimp and caviar... I didn't want to stop eating at all. I was kicking myself for not having come here earlier, and then for not coming again and again and again. It was slightly surreal, being there. Originally, I absolutely did NOT want to deal with the crowd. But it was beyond worth it, without a doubt. Amazing beyond belief.",
