    "great experience. my wife and i went and got sat at what was equivalent of a sushi bar. sat right in front of a whole team of chefs creating certain dishes. very fun to watch.they are big on the server recommending a bunch of dishes and creating a type of tasting menu. we picked out probably 4-5 that we really wanted and he said he could work those into the tasting menu.i dont like olives, but those olive things were awesome. they take so much care in serving them also.watermelon sangria, pillows, razor clams, tuna belly, along with many other things were all excellent.would recommend this place to anyone.don't think about coming without a reservation.",
