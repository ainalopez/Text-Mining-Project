    "I could cry thinking about this place. It might be the best food I've had in my life. After I came here, I returned the next night and the next night. Save yourself the time and effort and just eat here. It's the best food in the world. The service is just lovely. Omg it hurts thinking about this place, it's just so good.The duck ceviche is everything.Best paella in Barcelona.The vermouth, got me drunk! :)",
