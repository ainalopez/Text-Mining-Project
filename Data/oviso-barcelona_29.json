    "Oh, how many days have I spent sitting outside at Oviso in Plaza Trippy (ahem, Plaza George Orwell), chatting with friends and people watching....This is a great spot for outdoor seating, though it fills up fast and there's often a wait. Be mindful that Bar Lisa next door puts out their chairs right next to Oviso's and often are not as full, basically cause their food is horrible compared to Oviso's. Oviso serves some pretty great sandwiches and salads with a fun staff. It's very laid-back and captures the mood of the Trippy area - perroflautas, art, cheap eats....",
