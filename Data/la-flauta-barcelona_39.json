    "La Flauta was one of our favorite meals in Barcelona-- probably the best if you ask me! We sat at the bar and were given great recommendations on dishes to try. I'm not a huge foie gras person, but my husband wanted to try it and said it was the BEST. We also loved the steak and this ridiculous dish (can't recall the name) that basically consisted of fries covered in fried egg, jamon, and sauce (similar to the kind usually served with potatas bravas). The egg plate was incredibly naughty but ridiculously good. We also loved the fried Camembert with almonds and raspberry sauce quite a bit. Definitely come hungry! I also had the best glass of rioja (or two!) we had on the trip at this place-- a good find.",
