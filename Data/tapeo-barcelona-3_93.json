    "Food was delicious. Get the beef cheek. We made a reservation ahead of time using The Fork app (if you are in Barcelona definitely get this app to find restaurants). We were seated right away even though the place was very busy. The hostess/server was a little rude but it was also insanely busy. In a really cool area - definitely check it out!",
