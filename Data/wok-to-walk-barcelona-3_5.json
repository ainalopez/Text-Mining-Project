    "Extremely solid fast food for a late nite either before or after the club. Nothing amazing, just quick tasty Asian stir fry with a fair number of ingredient and sauce options. Think teriyaki chicken and rice bowl or Vegetable udon noodle box. Won't knock your socks off but is a really convenient and filling meal when you want it.",
