    "Mosquito has great food and great beer. \u00a0It was slightly confusing to sit down on a table then get asked to get up, but then we realized we had to put our name in first. \u00a0We ended up eating at the bar, which was good. \u00a0The menu is in Catalan but they will explain in Spanish or English. \u00a0Very good experience.",
