    "You will wait in line of you're not the first 25 people but it is SO worth it!! Honestly the best food we have had in a long time. We had calamari, excellent, tuna tar tar, amazing! Omlet, fantastic and fried artichokes, to die for. We also had the 'pastry.' Do not pass this up, it is the best party you'll have. The service was amazing as well. The chef on the stove was adorable and Oscar the server made recommendations and chatted with us. Go here!!!",
