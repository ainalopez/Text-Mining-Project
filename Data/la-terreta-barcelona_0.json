    "Agree with reviewer who always has Pa en Oli y Sal. We didn't know what combo to choose so we asked our delightful waitress. The result was truly delicious. Also some meatballs in a Roquefort sauce, washed down with the house red wine. We were in Barcelona the end of August. Nice to find a place with A/C. Very clean and orderly place.We left happy. BTW, they played great music the whole time we were there. Wish there were a place like this in Baltimore.",
