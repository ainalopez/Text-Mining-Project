    "Kind of funny to give this place 4 stars. \u00a0I tried 3 different things and didn't really like any of them. \u00a0BUT, I loved the menu. \u00a0I love restaurants that shy away from the traditional and they had a lot of interesting stuff on the menu. \u00a0I'm hoping some of them I would have liked (not sure if I'll give them another try).I had a scallop/tuna roll (not sure of the names of any of this stuff) that was pretty light on the scallop. \u00a0A beef/eel dish that turned out to be basically meatballs with a teriyaki sauce and an ebi/shrimp fried in noodles. \u00a0The ebi was cold and raw in the middle, I told the waiter (not sure if he understood me) and he eventually said that was normal. \u00a0Not sure if it was but it took me by surprise.",
