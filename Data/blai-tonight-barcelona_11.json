    "My travel companion and I came here because it was so highly reviewed on yelp. This is seriously the first and only time yelp has disappointed me. We went around 9pm and it was busy, but the food was not fresh at all. The cold tapas were warm and the hot tapas were cold. There were a few that were excellent and if you caught a fresh plate coming right out of the kitchen, it was pretty good, but we were disappointed for the most part.",
