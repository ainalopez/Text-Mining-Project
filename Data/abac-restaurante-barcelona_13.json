    "3.5 stars, not quite 4 stars. \u00a0This is the first time I felt very disconnected with a Michelin starred restaurant. \u00a0I felt that 5 out of the first 6 dishes had some sort of ice-cream sorbet on the dish, which was kinda repetitive. \u00a0I had high expectation of this newly crowned 2 star Michelin restaurant but the whole meal was quite a let down. \u00a0As another yelper mentioned, food was by no means bad. \u00a0But the flavor was a solid 3.5, it was a lower energy kinda environment, hotel is super neat and hip, everything else is good but not great. \u00a0Again, I felt disconnected and lost. \u00a0After the first 5-6 courses of smaller plates, the portion did get more substantial and the meal picked up with more substance, less monotone and complexity. \u00a0But I still expected more from ABaC.",
