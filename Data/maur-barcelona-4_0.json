    "The best restaurant I visited in Barcelona by far. Unlike many of the tourist traps throughout the city, the folks at Maur understand that going out to dinner is not just about the food, but about the experience you have while you're there. Maur gets it right in both departments. Great food, great ambiance, helpful staff.My wife and I shared the Sword (a specialty skewer with sausages and vegetables), a mini fondue, two desserts, and a bottle of water for 34 Euro total. Cheaper than we expected, and everything was delicious.",
