    "I wandered in here while I was exploring the fisherman's village. Unfortunately, my brother and I were just killing time before lunch, so we weren't planning to eat or drink anything here. We randomly ordered the grilled mussels, which ended up being the best mussels I've ever had. They were simply grilled and topped with a garlic aioli, and they were so sweet and fresh. The owner was nice, and this place seemed like a local's joint. I wish I had ordered a glass of wine and some more tapas.",
