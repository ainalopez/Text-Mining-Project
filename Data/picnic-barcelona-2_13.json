    "Picnic was by far my favorite Barcelona dining experience. It was my brunch after visiting the (somewhat) nearby Picasso museum.Located at the intersection of what seems like 3 little streets in \"Old Town Barcelona\", Picnic was pretty crowded for a Sunday late morning. Locals it seems... that's gotta be a good sign.I sat at the bar, and ordered what looked good: eggs benedict. And boy were they! Nice and runny w/good sea salt on top. The only drawback was a slightly too crunchy/chewy bread underneath. I also asked for a \"Cortado\" as recommended by a friend - a fancy espresso... and onion rings for the hell of it, whose sauce was great.The waitress continued to speak to me in Spanish, which I appreciated as well. Just wish I could get some tap water instead of bottled water...",
