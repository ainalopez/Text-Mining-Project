    "Ate lunch here with my girlfriend. We ordered calamari, squid, and the scallops with half a pitcher of sangria. The food was delicious and the sangria was very tasty. The half pitcher was enough to share between two people, two glasses each person. The waitress was nice and the service was good. We waited for about 15 minutes before getting sat. Definitely would return to this restaurant again.",
