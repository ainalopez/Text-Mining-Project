    "Oustanding. It is a bit off the beaten path in El Poble Sec but absolutely worth the effort. Be sure to arrive 15 minutes before opening and try to grab a spot (standing) near the bar. Otherwise you will have to elbow your way back to the front to order. The place immediately fills up. The tapas are amazing.",
