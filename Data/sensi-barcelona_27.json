    "Best meal we had in our trip to barcelona. I don't remember the names of all of the items we split, but they were all delicious. We had the duck dish that has \"the great\" at the end of it (delicious), seafood paella (best of the trip), Norwegian casserole (incredible), potatoes bravas (best of the trip), and truffle ravioli. The drinks were made excellent and the service was spot on. Do not sleep on this place. It's very busy, so clearly others aren't sleeping on it either",
