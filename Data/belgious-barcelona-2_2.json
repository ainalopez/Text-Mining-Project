    "This place located in the Gothic Quarter is awesome. They only use all-natural ingredients in their creations. The waffles are so light and crispy you won't believe it and the smell of the chocolate melting is out of this world. They have sweet crepes like Nutella with strawberries, banana and fresh whipped cream, but they also have lunch crepes as well, like one that had tuna, tomato, mozzarella and oregano. They also have a large assortment of fresh juices from Brazil including the world-reknowned A\u00e7ai berry, which is a natural energy booster. And finally, they have an amazing assortment of ice cream, again, all-natural. The flavours will blow your mindflavours like Mango, Curry, Rosemary, Black Olive and of course all the usuals too.",
