    "Great, reasonably priced place for both food and drinks near Parel-lel metro stop. After a long trip of eating authentic Spanish food, I was in the mood for a pizza, and Domino Bar did not disappoint. Their selection was wide, and the pizza I ended up ordering (the Genovesa) was delicious. The service was friendly and good, and the house wine that they recommended was quite good and very reasonably priced (at 2.50/ glass). Would definitely go back if I were in the area again.",
