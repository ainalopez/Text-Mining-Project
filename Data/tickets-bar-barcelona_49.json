    "Our first meal in Barcelona, and we really loved it. \u00a0The wait staff helped us from tapa selection to wine/beer pairing, and it was a lovely meal. \u00a0We were fortunate to sit by the kitchen entrance and saw all the hard work that the staff had to do for every single plate coming out. \u00a0The presentation was thoughtful and unpretentious. \u00a0Decor was minimal, because food is everything but that. \u00a0The shrimp, razor clam, oyster were spectacular. \u00a0Yes, it was an expensive meal and my husband (yes, we just got married the day before) may need to sell his body for the next few days.",
