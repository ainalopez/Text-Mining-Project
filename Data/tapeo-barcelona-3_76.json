    "The truffled eggs are fantastic. \u00a0Very rich with a mild flavor. \u00a0You can't have too much of it so it works fine with the amount they serve. \u00a0Very expensive at 16 Euros but worth the taste. \u00a0The honey ribs were good as well. \u00a0The sangria was fresh though small for the 1/2 L. \u00a0Get the full Liter as it equates to other restaurants 1/2 pitcher. \u00a0Not standard units of measure. \u00a0The creme foam dessert wasn't substantial enough so pass on that. \u00a0There must be a better dessert than that that we didn't try on the menu. \u00a0Small space and got to watch the chefs in action. \u00a0They must have their processes executed exactly as there is not much room for four of them to work in that space.",
