    "The Mexican food struggle in Europe is real, but you can trust all the other reviews by proud Californians - La Taqueria is legit. After an oversupply of Spanish olive oil and tomatoes, this place was like heaven. It's literally 30 secs from La Sagrada Familia, but you wouldn't know it because it's tucked away on a super quiet side street.Tacos al pastor were juicy, flavorful, DELICIOUS. Bean soup was absolutely yummy. Agua frescas were solid, and the fresh lime & salsas were free. Service was not the best - they brought us the wrong dish, forgot the soup, then served said soup lukewarm. At 2pm, they almost didn't seat us because we didn't have a reservation (???) but in the end said it was fine if we stayed an hour max (easy). It's also pricey for the portions. But it's real Mexican and that makes it all worth it.",
