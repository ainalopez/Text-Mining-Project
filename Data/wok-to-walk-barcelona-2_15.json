    "this sounds bad, but other than sagardi, my husband's fave place to eat when we were in barcelona was wok to walk. \u00a0we had it once before heading out to granada, where we only ate sandwiches, b/c there were not many meat-free options. \u00a0upon coming back to barcelona, he insisted we get wok to walk again! \u00a0this makes for a good option when you're tired of spanish food and want some \"asian\" food to make you feel at home.",
