    "One of my favorite bars in Barcelona. There are two areas: the bar, always packed with groups of people, chatter and laughing and an area at the back with old sofas, where the usually nice people can hang out and have decent conversations about the important topics of our time. The toilet is nice and big enough to have orgies there and the drinks are modestly priced. Great place.",
