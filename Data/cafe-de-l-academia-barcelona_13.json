    "Exquisite service, beautiful and delicious food, and a lovely setting made for the perfect last night in Barcelona.We had numerous starters, and the care in preparation and presentation were clearly evident: vegetable timbale, mini toasted cheese wedges, and eggplant terrine.The entrees were just divine: shrimps, squid, and a gorgeous plate of thinly sliced, very rare beef.I highly recommend this delightful restaurant if you're in town. \u00a0Pricey, and worth every euro.",
