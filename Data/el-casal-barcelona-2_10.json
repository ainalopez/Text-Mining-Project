    "The food was very tasty and delicious. \u00a0I wasn't super hungry so I just ordered the ham and Brie sandwich and a coffee with milk while my boo had one of the breakfast specials which had toast and a potato quiche (a tortilla I think they called it). \u00a0The server and people there were incredibly kind and friendly in helping us with the menu considering my Spanish was not very good. \u00a0I was very surprised and somewhat moved with how kind they were to a few bumbling jet-lagged American tourists who stumbled into their cafe probably committing faux pas every moment we were there. \u00a0I will definitely go back again while I'm here. \u00a0Very quaint and great place.",
