    "This is not a place you will just happen upon. \u00a0It's off the beaten path, but worth finding. \u00a0This is very authentic in it's feel and food. \u00a0They have a nice wine selection. \u00a0The wait staff did not speak English, but we did very well understanding one another. \u00a0We had a variety of appetizers...Jubago cured ham (wonderful balance of saltiness and tasty flavor), rock lobster salad (spot on and simple), but, arguably, my favorite was the white beans (tender with a very flavorful sauce). \u00a0I had the Vizcaya-style cod fish. \u00a0It was surprisingly good. \u00a0The texture was great and it was cooked to perfection. \u00a0The sauce was also terrific. \u00a0I recommend this place, especially if you want down-to-earth, authentic cuisine without the glitz and glam.",
