    "I was really looking forward to visiting this place with 4.5star on yelp. \u00a0My husband and I had a bit of hard time to find as we got lost on our scooter and the entrance of Can Cisa had a different name on it for some reason. \u00a0I believe it said \"Bar Brutal\" and so did the menu. \u00a0So I wasn't even sure if it was Can Cisa until I looked at \u00a0the pictures on yelp. \u00a0The food is great. \u00a0No doubt about it. \u00a0However the service was questionable. \u00a0It took really long time until we were able to order for one. \u00a0Then we were waiting another 20 min to get our bill....we finally decided to get up from our table and went up to the waitress to pay. \u00a0Then she told us to wait at our table. \u00a0One minus star....I accidentally left my purse and walked out of the restaurant. \u00a0But fortunately I noticed a minute later and walked back into the restaurant. \u00a0The waitress we had saw me, took out my purse behind the bar counter and handed to me. \u00a0I know it is my fault to leave my personal belongings, however I was standing right in front of the restaurant so she could have just followed me and gave it back to me. \u00a0Instead she hoped that I wouldn't come back and she could keep my cash and credit cards??? \u00a0I know it is Spain and all but this place is not cheap and has 4.5 star....something like this shouldn't happen. \u00a0So for that, another star has to be taken off.",
