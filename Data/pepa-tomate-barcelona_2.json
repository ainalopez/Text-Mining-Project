    "We went here on a recommendation from our Airbnb owner and were pretty disappointed. We were really hungry and inhaled a bunch of fried stuff and felt icky afterward. We had a bottle of kava and olives and potato chips to start. The tapas I shared were the green lobster and lentil \"tacos\" (the combo didn't really go together), the fried spinach balls with honey aioli (kind of flavorless without the sauce), the fried potatoes, and the saut\u00e9ed truffles veggies. I wouldn't go back.",
