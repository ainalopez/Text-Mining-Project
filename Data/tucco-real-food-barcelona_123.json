    "This place is AMAZING. Best food I've had in Barcelona. The people at the restaurant are so kind and they explain the menu to you in detail. They always have smiles on their faces from beginning to end. The price is great for an entree, a drink, and a dessert (which was great as well). Highly recommend this place!",
