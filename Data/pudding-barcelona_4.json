    "So so so so cute!! The waitress/cashier is nice. She didn't really speak English but she was patient while I formed my sentences. The food is pretty good too and not very expensive. My friend and I ordered a Spanish tortilla for 5\u20ac. The only thing I didn't like was the food had to be reheated. Other than that, no complaints! It's a really pleasant place to have breakfast.",
