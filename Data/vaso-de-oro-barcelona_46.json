    "Nice atmosphere, nice bar, but overpriced and the food is a too greasy for my taste, and not worth the money. Get a beer and a little snack instead a lot of food.The room and the waiters are probably the most unique part of this bar,restaurant: It is a quite long room in which the bar goes from one end to the other. Especially when considering the width which is so narrow that one can only pass the people sitting at this bar if one squeezes - which is kinda cool.Food: stay away from the bravas: very small portion, expensive and not that great. Be aware that the chorizo is cut into pieces and deep fried - an unnecessary thing.",
