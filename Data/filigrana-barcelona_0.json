    "Best Catalonian ham EVER. I was on a mission to eat as much tapas as I humanly could before I left Barcelona, this place takes the cherry of the cake on my last day! It's located right across the street from the bullfight ring, not far away from the sants train station, but it's on the quiet side of the street, so it's not a completely crowded \"just another\" tourist place. The terrace settings are completely shady with amazing breeze, you face the street but not a lot of passerbys, all in all a perfect setting to spend a lazy spaniard afternoon doing absolutely nothing, while waiting for my train. I had the most expensive item on the tapas menu, the Catalonian ham, and it was worth every penny. It's a darker red color, the fat is crystallized and juicy, melts in your mouth, every bite gives intense pleasure ( and sorry but I really can't think of another way to describe it better!) I think even my toes were pleased with the the taste of the ham. Also had the grilled green pepper, hands down the best I've had, the tempera prawn, looks typical, but the prawn inside SO fresh and juicy. The traditional bread with tomato and garlic rub was also very good. The waitress was super warm and sweet, nice extra touch to the extraordinary food.",
