    "This is a Barcelona mini-chain, with four locations around the city. It seems okay, but possibly a bit touristy and pricey: you can probably do better by looking for places that are a little less glossy. Still, this location, on a broad busy avenue under trees, is an excellent place to grab a cold beer and watch the world go by.",
