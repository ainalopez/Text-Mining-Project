    "Wonderful place to dine in Barcelona! Just make sure to bring your appetite! The Chef was so friendly, welcoming, and eager to share his craft. He even recommendedanother restaurant for \"the best paella in Barcelona\" (which showed us how much he cared). He explained that his restaurant specializes in \"comfort food\". Everything was delicious here and the portions are more than generous (Honestly, an entree could easily be shared). I especially loved the mussels and my dessert of Catalan cream. A wonderful spot! Thank you for a great evening.",
