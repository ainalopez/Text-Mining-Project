    "This was the best tapas place in Barcelona so far! Everything from service to food was amazing! We got the asparagus which was lightly fried and delicious! The lamb was also grilled to perfection and beef with chimichurri was mouth wateringly good. They had specials where we got the tuna and that was also just as good. After someone else recommended the bread pudding on here, I got that too and that did not disappoint! I would definitely go back here!",
