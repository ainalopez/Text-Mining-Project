    "Sought this place out based on other reviews, and we were SO glad we did! It is tiny; a party of seven came in just before us and we (party of five) almost were turned away, but they made it work. The aesthetics aren't great; think \"unadorned diner\", but you're there for delicious food, not decor. Clearly a family-run operation, the small staff was very friendly and the food was, indeed, fantastic. We had tacos, enchiladas (a house specialty) and quesadillas, plus guacamole to start. Agua Fresca del dia was delicious, and fresh, hot, tasty food came out quickly, despite there being one cook in the kitchen at first. (\"Mama\" came to help out later.) No time for dessert, as we wanted to catch the magic fountain show, so I can't comment on that. (Note: Order plenty, as you'll have to wait your turn if you didn't ask for enough the first time. Count on four tacos pp.) We left full and happy!",
