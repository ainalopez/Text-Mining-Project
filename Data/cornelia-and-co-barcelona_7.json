    "Excellent interior, looked really nice and cozy. We had the spicy potatoes and croquetes for starters, latter were unusual but they were homemade and tasted good!Entrees were chicken with curry and half smoked salmon. Chicken was very good, spicy and rice with it was excellent. Half smoked salmon was perfectly cooked but the extra was boiled potatoes which is nothing special.For dessert had the apple tatin and ecleres. Latter was to die for!!Had a mojito as well. The ingredients were literally picked off of the plants growing there! It was very good.All the food there is made on the spot from 0. They grow their own herbs in the garden and everything is prepared every morning.Overall an excellent experience. Would recommend it to anyone!",
