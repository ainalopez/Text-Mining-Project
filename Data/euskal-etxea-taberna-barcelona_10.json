    "In Japan they have \"Tabehoudai\", all you can eat places. Euskal is similar, if you do the tapas you get to eat and pay by the sticks that you take. Interesting, saves the issue with the language when ordering tapas, but quite crowded. There are better places although for a large group might be excellent as you eat standing and there is no problem finding space.",
