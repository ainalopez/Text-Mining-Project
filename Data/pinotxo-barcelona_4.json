    "Every single thing I put in my mouth was phenomenal. \u00a0Not an exaggeration. \u00a0Ate several cold pintxos (cheeses, sardine, shrimp) and hot (shrimp, cod, octopus, beef, burgers). It was all amazing. \u00a0Stop looking for restaurants and make a reservation here immediately. \u00a0You will not be disappointed.",
