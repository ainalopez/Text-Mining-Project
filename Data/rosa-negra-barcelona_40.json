    "Delicious food and really solid prices for Barca. We all really enjoyed our meals. Service on the other hand was pretty crappy. They never brought some of our drinks and were never around so we could get their attention. In a comical moment, they brought us 4 waters that we ordered at the beginning of the meal literally as we were getting the check. I'd go again cause the food was great, but try to get there when it's not too busy.",
