    "Staff were very friendly, giving us a run down of the ordering procedure. Had the seasonal burger and thought it was one of the better burgers I've had. For 7.50, the burger was priced ok. Avoid the fries though. That was an unnecessary add on at 3.90. Still, great service and good food for 5 stars.",
