    "Excellent tapas spot in the barri gotic. Great tapas, good wine, good service. Convenient location, maybe a block off La Rambla. So if you're on La Rambla near the Liceu metro stop do yourself a favor - skip the touristy places there and come here instead.The only thing I didn't like is that there are no seats at the tapas bar. You have to stand.",
