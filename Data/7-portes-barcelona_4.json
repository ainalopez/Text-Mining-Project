    "Went with my boyfriend as we were referred there by a local for their paella. We ordered an appetizer and *one* serving of paella to share. When the bill came, we had been charged for two servings of paella, which we did not order. They also had charged us for bread, which we had not asked for but were given anyways. We spoke to the waiter who took our order, another who served us, AND the manager and explained there was an error -- but the staff all claimed that because there were two people eating the paella that they had served us for two, because that's how they do it. However this disclaimer of the double charge is not clearly stated on the menu. Not to mention that we were unaware they gave us two servings because it was given to us in the same pan all together to share. We explained their misunderstanding of our order (and mind you, there was no language barrier as my boyfriend is Latin American and speaks fluently in Spanish) but even the manager refused to budge on amending our bill. The paella was outstanding which is why I give three stars but otherwise I don't recommend this restaurant as they only care about making a quick buck off unknowing tourists who they know are never coming back.",
