    "The concept of this restaurant was kind of awesome.... like a buffet, but you pay \u00a0a small fee for each item (1.50 euro ish). There were some items that were incredible and others that were so so. We tried a ham croquette with a roasted pepper on top.... this was the most delicious thing... I could've eaten twelve of them. The grilled pork on a stick was yummy. The mini paella.... not so good. We had a few more items, but nothing terribly memorable. The bill was inexpensive. If you're passing by, this place is worth a stop.",
