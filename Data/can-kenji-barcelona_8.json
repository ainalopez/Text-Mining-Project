    "After you have all the paella, boutifara, cheese, and hams of all different parts of the pig, it can get a bit tiring. That's why I love Can Kenji. We come here at least once every time we visit (which is about 5+ times a year). Though I would personally never order the sushi because it's quite boring, the other menu items are creative and delicious. I highly recommend the monk liver tofu! It's better than foie gras. And speaking of foie gras, they also make a delicious burger topped with it. There really is a strange harmony in home-cooked Japanese meals and Mediterranean cuisine. Reservations are highly recommended, unless you get there early, which in Spanish time is 8pm and if you don't mind sitting at the bar.",
