    "This place is tucked away in an alley. Quite difficult to find and to my surprise when we got there....no seats available. Went back the next day due to the draw from the amazing Yelp ratings. Food: Everything had bread...I'm not hating on bread....but it was excessive. The food overall was decent but I didn't care for it. Service: Very friend staff who even gave us a sample of another dish. Environment: Love the wine cellar environment here. Price; Average price. Food: 3Service: 5Environment: 4Price: 4",
