    "As a tourist, you will be assailed by a variety of food places parading as some form of tapas, pintxos, small plates, etc. \u00a0Luckily in Barcelona even the worst isn't so bad, though it may be too expensive.What's great about Bilbao Berria is the combination of quality, value, and reliability. You'll always get good food at good prices, in a friendly place.But be careful of the comfort of complacency. You're supposed to be having adventures!",
