    "Delicious and healthy! Great spot near Plaza de Catalunya catering to health nuts. I loved everything we ordered with the exception of the BTT (Beet Tuna Tartar - it was a little fishy). All of the wines are organic and all of the food super fresh and tasty. It can be hard to make healthy food flavorful, but Teresa Carles does not disappoint!",
