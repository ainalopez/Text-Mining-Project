    "I've gotta admit, I'm a bit disappointed after the yelp raves. Maybe we ordered the wrong things? Service was friendly and the albondigas were good--very tender with a slightly sweet tomato sauce. Bread with tomato was good as well. The patatas bravas were a huge disappointment. Not crispy and borderline undercooked, worse than frozen french fries and I wasn't a fan of the bravas sauce. Grilled veggies were good but you can't go too wrong with that. Not a fan of the homemade croquettes either; they were cool on the inside and hard to distinguish apart. I'm sure there's better tapas out there.",
