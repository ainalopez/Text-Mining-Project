    "Had been eating tapas for every meal for a few days when my husband and I, roaming the streets at night, spotted the neon red \"Ramen\" sign floating down an alleyway! \u00a0We are diehard but critical ramen fans and vowed to eat there the next evening. \u00a0When we arrived, we were warmly greeted by the owner, almost as if we were old friends. \u00a0The waitress was also very sweet. \u00a0I forget which meat ramen my husband ordered but he thought it was fantastic. \u00a0More difficult to make tasty, I thought the vegetarian miso ramen was a huge success! \u00a0The local microbrews we had on the side were also great. \u00a0Would eat here again if in Barcelona and craving ramen :)",
