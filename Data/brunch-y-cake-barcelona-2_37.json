    "Everything on this menu is to die for. My favorite item on the menu is the \"Huevos Benedict\", which includes eggs benedict on a waffle with ham including a small delicious salad. The sweetness of the waffle and saltiness of the eggs benedict is a perfect mixture. \u00a0I am in love with eggs benedict and get it at every brunch I go to. This was the best that I have ever had. The originality of the waffle under the eggs benedict is the perfect touch to a creative eggs benedict. A must for brunch!",
