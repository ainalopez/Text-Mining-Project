    "Hubby and I stumbled across Pinotxo one fine morning and boy, I'm sure glad we did. Walking around La Boqueria, it's not very hard to miss. There was already a good amount of people there.I had tried the egg thingy (not the omelette, something flatter) and this small pastry that everyone seemed to order. WHOA - this was one of the most memorable food I have ever eaten. SO GOOD...that's what we kept saying to each other with a look of contentment. I wish we ordered more food or came back for another meal, but I guess that gives us an excuse to return to Barcelona. :)",
