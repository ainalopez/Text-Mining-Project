    "We now came here twice during our 1 week stay in Barcelona. The food is excellent and not expensive when compared with other restaurants item by item. It seems a lot of Spanish natives come here in groups in the evening. Gets full very very fast in the evening. You can easily catch a place at the nice bar before 8 pm if you are a bit lucky as we were or a table between 6 or 7. Reserve for later. The chicken and the arroz de sepia negro is great. The seafood salad is delicious and the best that we tried in Barcelona. And try the cake coca de Llavaneras for desert. You won't regret this.",
