    "Gopal is my favorite vegan eatery in Barcelona! \u00a0The sandwiches are super messy and delicious and the potatoes are delicious & positively drenched in yummy sauce. \u00a0Even though it physically pains me to do so, I eat every bite and STILL soldier my way through a donut afterwards. \u00a0The service is pretty slow for a deli environment but it's definitely worth it. \u00a0Bonus points for all the cool vegan posters & art on the walls.",
