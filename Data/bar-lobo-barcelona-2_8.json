    "We came here for late dinner on our last night in Barcelona and had the best octopus dish (pulpo Galeatano)! I still dream about it. The octopus was so fresh and tender and perfectly seasoned. We also ordered the Lobo burger and the arroz marinero and they were both pretty good. Don't expect a typical American burger if you order the Lobo burger, it's open faced and much thinner and it's seasoned differently. There was a note about the rice dish needing 20 mins but it was definitely less than that when they served it to us. They also had a nice selection of wine.Love the interior and vibe too, it's very modern/chic.",
