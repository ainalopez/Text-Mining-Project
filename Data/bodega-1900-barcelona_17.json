    "We were late to get tickets to Tickets... so we \"settled\" for Bodega 1900. And our socks were blown off, out the door, across the street, never to be returned. The Adri\u00e0 brothers (from El Bulli) have nailed it - from friendly, fast service to thoughtful dishes that play with molecular gastronomy. The drinks, the portions, the taste - it was all there and then some. We left with huge grins and full bellies. Highly recommended.",
