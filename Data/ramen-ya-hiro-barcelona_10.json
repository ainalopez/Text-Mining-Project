    "Very good quality for an affordable price. Went there on a Monday for lunch and found a 2 hours queue. During the week they have a set menu and it's very worth for the quality and price. Gyoza, ramen and drink for 10 euros. The ramen was almost as good as the one you can find in Japan. Excellent customer service also. I will defo repeat again.",
