    "We stumbled upon this restaurant on our first evening in Barcelona and it was amazing! After a long day of traveling it hit the spot. The appetizers, entrees, drinks and dessert were all excellent. The quaint modern atmosphere was hip yet relaxing. The staff was attentive and accommodating. We loved everything about this place!",
