    "I came here on my last night in Barcelona for some tapas, and I still remember the taste of the delicious dishes I tried here. I'm not so much a fan of the soccer games playing loudly here, but the place and the menu have more of a locals feel than most tapas bars in touristy Barcelona. Mario Batali loves La Clara, and I did too. I particularly enjoyed the patatas bravas, the best we had in Spain, and the Catalan specialty of sausage with white beans. The pan tomate also was outstanding. This is a great restaurant for experiencing Catalan cuisine and tapas just the way the locals would.",
