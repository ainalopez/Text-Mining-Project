    "By far one of the best Paellas in Barcelona. Great friendly staff, magnificent view of the beach in Paseo Maritimo. 2 Michelin Stars Chef. We ate so much and it was all so good. They start you with house olives and pickled garlic n tiny onions. \u00a0We started with Bomba Barracca, delicious fried croquettes, fried Squid with tartar sauce, steam mussels in Lemongrass and Szechuan sauce, delicious. \u00a0Another bowl of steamed clams, mussels and more in a delicious broth. Cod fritters, oh so good, and I do not like cod! Burrata salad with arugula, tomatoes and herbs; balsamic vinegar and delicious Artequina Olive Oil. The piece de resistance ; the Paellas, we shared two different ones. Both equally delicious. \u00a0Desert Crema Catalana , I did not like it, and pears with delicious ice cream. What a great meal. Try to go, you will not regret it. Bon appetit.May be a bit pricey but oh so well worth it.",
