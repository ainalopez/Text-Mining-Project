    "Excellent lunch spot if you are in the Gaudi houses area. \u00a0The pepitas are \"sandwiches\" that are absolutely delicious. \u00a0I had the beef, four and egg one that was yummy. \u00a0My wife really loved her tuna papita. \u00a0If you have not tried it, try the mato for dessert. \u00a0It's a smooth goat cheese drenched in honey, only served in Catalan apparently. \u00a0The waitress was very welcoming and friendly, and she was happy to give us recommendations in english when asked. \u00a0We also asked her if the place was popular, and she told us that because they are so highly rated on Trip Advisor, and near the tourist attractions, that their restaurant has really taken off. \u00a0Deservedly so!",
