    "Foreneria Tiana was an easy walk from our little AIRBNB in the Barri Gotic to the Metro stop, with enticing pastries and little sandwiches in the window as you walk by. We stopped in for two breakfasts as it was easy and under $6 (EU) for two \"Bikini\" sandwiches and two coffees. The sandwiches were quite delicious and filling which was a perfect way to start our mornings in Barcelona. They also happen to have popsicles from (I'm guessing) a Barcelona popsicle company that we grabbed after our breakfast for $2(EU) and out the door. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something cheap, easy and quick.",
