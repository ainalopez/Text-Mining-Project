    "Amazing view of Sagrada Familia. Food looked better than it tasted. There was rust on my bottle of sparkling water near the opening - ever drank rusty flavored sparkling water? Gross. I ordered the warm seafood salad and it was a major disappointment. Not only was the seafood overcooked, it was stale. I also found half a yellow maggot (cooked) in my salad, wonderful. My man ordered a seafood and meat paella and he thought it was average. One star for the great view but I would avoid this place.",
