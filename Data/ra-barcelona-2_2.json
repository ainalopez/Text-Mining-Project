    "Near Las Ramblas, Ra is a quaint little hipster haven with traditional Spanish fare...with an exotic and modern (read: Asian) twist. The men\u00fa del d\u00eda is a steal for only \u20ac10,99 -- per usual in Spain: two courses, a dessert, and a drink. Their Cream of Spinach soup was delicious, but ran a bit cold. However, the crispy cheese bits and charred onion made up for it immensely. The second dish \"entrama en salsa,\" a beef fillet with a fresh salsa/salad of peppers and tomatoes tasted light, but overall was nothing spectacular. The dessert of arroz con leche was a bit overly sweet, but was flavorful. Nothing a jarra de cerveza can't fix. Overall a great find in the heart of Barcelona for its ambience and unique cuisine.",
