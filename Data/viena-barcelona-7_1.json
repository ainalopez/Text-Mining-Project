    "Coffee & croissants on our first morning in Barcelona - cute little croissants that were shaped like scorpions......at first I thought they were more like a crab but then remembered crabs don't have tails....so whatever the little bug they were supposed to be, they were adorable............and delicious - there was a very subtle sugary coating on the croissant to make it a sweet treatLattes were on the bitter side & needed just a spot of sugar but they were still A-OK coffeesStick to the croissants & you'll be huge fans......nice atmosphere to sit around the counter & watch all the hubbub & chaos, as the place serves a lot of people!! \u00a0But being right on the Ramblas, it makes sense it'd be this way",
