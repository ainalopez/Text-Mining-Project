    "My favorite place for Spanish tapas. The Patatas bravas are out of this world. And my new favorite tapa is the San Fermin. Highly recommend this place. Their outside staff at their Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia location could be a little friendlier, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and argue it may just have been a busy hour.They also have free wifi, but you have to ask for an individual ticket and it only works inside.",
