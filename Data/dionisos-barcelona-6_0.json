    "Our first night in Barcelona (Sunday) in an airbnb apartment in Eixample \u00a0We initially walked down to eat dinner at Flauta - but they were closed on Sunday. \u00a0With a group weary from a 18 hour trip that started Saturday afternoon and ended with us hauling suitcases through the rain from Plaza Catalunya to our apartment, we walked past this restaurant, viewed the fixed price menu, and decided to try out the restaurant.Fortunately, a GREAT choice.Half our party of 8 ended up eating off the fixed price menu. \u00a0The other half ordered off the menu. \u00a0My wife and I had the Greek tapas for 2 and the meat assortment for 2. \u00a0Both the starter and main were excellent. \u00a0The meat balls with tomato sauce and lamb were superb and the other meats were very good. \u00a0We are cooking the leftovers this morning for breakfast.The server's wine recommendation was very much appreciated (even the double cork :-) \u00a0).Staff was very friendly and attentive.",
