    "I had high hopes for this spot as they were one of the few places to show American football games on Sunday. We arrived, they said due to rain, the satellite feed was down. We came back later, the bartender was the only positive thing about this place. She was sweet and helpful. We ordered nachos and the pork ribs. The nachos arrived, unspectacular. A bunch of stale corn chips with a few spoonfuls of chopped tomatoes and a spoonful of sour cream. No cheese, nothing. The ribs arrived. Not smoked or grilled, but boiled and then a squirt of BBQ sauce in the middle of one piece. And the French fries that came with the plate were disgusting. Honestly, if you read my other reviews, I'm pretty easy to please. And I travel Europe constantly as part of my job. I don't expect to eat American type food everywhere, in fact I'd rather not. I love all the unique cultures and flavors of Europe. But if you are going to call yourself a pub and have pub grub on the menu, get it right for crying out loud! I should have known better than to expect anything decent out of a chain restaurant. I feel like I had a Chili's experience in the US! Avoid this place, there are so many wonderful places to eat in Barcelona. This isn't one of them.",
