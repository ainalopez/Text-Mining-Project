    "We just finished our food. I had to write this review immediately...to capture the exact mood.We are both stunned. The food is absolutely incredible. So many flavors and so much authenticity. The nachos were absolutely to. die. for.We also shared the tinga tacos and the chalupas. The tacos were...well...tacos. Awesome tacos, but still \"just\" tacos. So if you want to experience something unique and special go for the chalupas. Mmmmmm deep fried tortilla. Also there are like 15 seats in the whole place so prepare to wait and/or be flexible.The ladies working behind the bar are super cool and charming.Please just come here!",
