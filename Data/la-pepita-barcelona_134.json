    "One of the best meals we had in Barcelona. Everything we had was creative and well-executed. Our favorites were the botifarra pepita (sausage sandwich), sea bass with strawberries, foie gras over potatoes and eggs, and the croquettes (covered in Iberian ham). The gin and tonics -- one citrus, one ginger-apple, and one grape -- were also as good as advertised. I wish we discovered this place earlier in this trip, because we definitely would've tried to go a second time. Highly recommended.",
