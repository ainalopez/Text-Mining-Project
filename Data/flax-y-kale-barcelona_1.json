    "Visited the restaurant for dinner on a Sunday visit to Barcelona. Sadly the experience was underwhelming to say the least. The menu and the interior promised a lot - hip New York influenced healthy food...the reality didn't really deliver.What worked:- menu in English - free wifi - couple of the dishes were tasty eg the curry What didn't:- no kale chips - food served luke warm- a lot of food eg hummus, sorbet were clearly prepared for service much earlier and then assembled before being sent out. For a restaurant that celebrates fresh and healthy, seeing food being obviously mass produced factory style is disappointing - and smacks of trying to fool the customer. As I said; underwhelming.",
