    "If we talk about restaurants, I have my own philosophy: \"if I look the place is busy, I have to try it\". Spanish, Bolivian, Argentinian, Italian, English, American, Canadian, and all different nationalities together in this place to taste the many flavors and scents that this restaurant can offer. As starters, if you are a fan of mojitos, you do not have to miss the cranberries Mojito. That beverage is AMAZING. And that is just the beginning! This roller coaster of food pleasure is just going up!! Continue your food journey with the best Tapa of the year (one of the many appetizer the house can offer): the fried octopus. If you could not try this appetizer in your last trip to beautiful Barcelona, please bother to go back to Arume again and fix it!!! Thus, if you think that you have reached an unapproachable level of pleasure and you cannot have anything that can surpass it. Well my friend, you are wrong!! Try any of the Paellas and you will fall from your seat!!In a few words, this restaurant summarizes the Wash Post article about how Spain ranks 1st as the world's most tourism-friendly country in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index.Ps., make reservations, the place is really busy!!",
