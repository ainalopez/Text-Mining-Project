    "One of my favourite vegan restaurants anywhere. Exceptionally good food, fabulous ambiance and just downright wonderful. Went for dinner - tried the lasagna (divine), plus one of their salads. Also excellent. Came back for breakfast and drooled over their seiten club sandwich. Also tried the chia pudding - very good, but a bit sweet for my taste. Regardless, an absolute must if you're in Barcelona. Enjoy!",
