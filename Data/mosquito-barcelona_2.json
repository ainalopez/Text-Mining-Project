    "Very solid Asian tapas place. All of the dumplings are amazing and the duck #2 is a must order. Classics such as edamame as well. The pork belly was very good but quite rich, a bit too much so for 2 peoples to split. The bang bang chicken sounded weird as it was cold, but glad we ordered it because it was only of my favorites. There was a 30 minute wait when we got there but it turned out to move very quickly and ended up being more like 10 minutes. Cool assortment of Catalan craft beers, my favorite was the Sitges wheat.",
