    "Went here last night. It was great! If you're in Barcelona definitely worth trying. The atmosphere was beautiful and the wait staff was amazing. For starters we had the scallops and chorizo tacos, we knew the entrees would be great after just eating the starters. For an entree I tried the sea bass with crab stuffed leaks and wow they were great. I was also able to sample some of my companions food, the lamb, the duck paella and seafood paella which were very good. The blackberry mojito was the best mojito I've had yet. To end the night were small copas of Orujo cream (yum).",
