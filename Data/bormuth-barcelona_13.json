    "First and foremost, the staff, particularly the floor manager was exceptional! My husband and I arrived at a busy time and while their is no waiting area (if so, very small) the person taking mental notes on names and the number of parties was on top of it. He let each person know when they would be next and kept them alert, even if there were no available tables at a particular point. When we finally were seated, we enjoyed a glass of cava, whiskey and ordered several dishes that were exceptional..namely, I really enjoyed the mussels and the meatballs. If you are in town or you're local (I apologize now for loud tourists) please stop by. You really can't beat the service here and the prices were on point. Note: large groups will be difficult to seat at high times.",
