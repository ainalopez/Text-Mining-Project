    "I was on vacation in Barcelona, and my girlfriend and I were craving some good paella. Bosque Palermo came up on our Yelp search, and we decided to try it.We definitely did not regret it. We ordered a salad and an order of their seafood paella. The paella is 10 euros per person, which I think is an amazing price for how much food you get.The salad was eh. They put too much dressing and it wasn't anything spectacular. However, the main star was the paella.It takes 30 mins to make, so make sure to order it early, and to order some wine or appetizers to hold you over until then. But when it comes...The aroma itself was tantalizing. The seasoning was on point, the seafood tasted sweet and fresh, and the rice had a nice creamy consistency. Overall, it was the best paella my girlfriend and I had in Barcelona and Madrid. It is definitely a must-try if you're in the area!!",
