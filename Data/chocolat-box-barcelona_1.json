    "Cute little cafe that has some sweet pastries that lean more on the American side but still has some traditional pastries. I call it the tourist comfort blanket with the familiar North American stuff, however, do yourself a favor and go outside the box. They made a really good latte. Prices are fair and customer service was decent.",
