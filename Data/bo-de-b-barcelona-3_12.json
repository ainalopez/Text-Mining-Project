    "This place may as well have a giant magnet outside for all the backpackers and budget travelers it attracts.The tldr; is this is where you go for CHEAP sandwiches.3-4 euros for a sandwich the size of most people's forearms. They don't skimp on meat or veggies, and I found the chicken sandwich to have a good balance of meat, veggies and sauces. (yes, *sauces*)The sandwiches are good, but I'd hesitate to call them great. They're certainly one of the best values in the city, and if you're on a tight budget you can't go wrong.",
