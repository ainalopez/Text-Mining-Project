    "I am no authority on Thai food at all but one day my wife and I strolled upon this place while looking for something non-touristy and non-tapas oriented. We decided to give it a try and we were glad we did. So glad that during our month long visit to Barcelona we ate here three or four times. The service was fast and friendly, the food was always delicious and fresh, and the prices were reasonable for the high quality ingredients that they use in their kitchen. \u00a0I would highly recommend this restaurant and we hope that you enjoy it as much as we did.",
