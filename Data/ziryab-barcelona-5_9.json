    "Came here for a late lunch, on the recommendations of my sister's friend. This was excellent all-around. Top quality hummus and babaganoush, the bacon wrapped dates were as good as anything, and the halloumi sticks were a find - so good! The prices were reasonable as well, just great all around.",
