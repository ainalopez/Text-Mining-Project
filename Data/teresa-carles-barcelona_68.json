    "Went there as a vegetarian with someone who isn't a vegetarian. Even he loved the food. Highly recommend a Reservation if it's a busy night as this place can get packedHad the croquettes (delicious) and some dishes recommended by the waitress: a Catalan style meatball soup. And a Aubergine dish. Never would have picked it ourselves. But there're surprisingly deliciousTeresa Carles has a surprisingly complexity that many vegetarian dishes and many vegetarian restaurants lack, making it a place that even non vegs can enjoy.",
