    "Great service and very friendly owner. He came by to tell me the names of the tapas I ordered and patiently explained the menu in English. Ordered the 7 tapas + wine special and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was! The amount kept me full for hours and food was clean, healthy, and homemade. I can tell the owner has great pride in what he serves. I came when the produce delivery person came by; to keep the ingredients fresh the owner does not order produce in bulks but daily. Also the owner opened the new bottle of Rioja for me to taste! Awesome!",
