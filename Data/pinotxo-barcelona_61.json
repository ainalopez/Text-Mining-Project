    "An amazing breakfast in Barcelona's Boqueria! \u00a0Juanito's welcoming smile and charm made us feel immediately at home. We were very lucky to have gotten a seat right away. \u00a0Because we didn't speak Spanish or Catalan, Juanito asked us a few questions on what type of food we wanted (beef, shrimp, clam, fish, egg, etc). \u00a0We ordered coffee all around and anxiously waited to see what dishes were going to show up. \u00a0The first dish was a rich and hearty beef stew with potatoes and peas. \u00a0Served with a small loaf of bread to sop up the gravy. \u00a0The second dish was grilled prawns, lightly seasoned with sea salt and olive oil. \u00a0The prawns were smoky, sweet, and PERFECTLY cooked. \u00a0The third dish, was Bacala (salt cod) poached in garlic and olive oil! \u00a0All I can say is OMG! The fish was perfectly cooked, luscious and decadent. I especially loved how Juanito kept urging me to dip my bread into the garlic oil and gravy. \u00a0Our final dish, gently cooked egg \"pie\" with toasted bread (rubbed with tomato). \u00a0Such simple ingredients, yet what a big impact in terms of texture and flavor. \u00a0Prices and Pinotxo are very reasonable. \u00a0Our breakfast cost a mere 49 Euro. \u00a0What a deal for such spectacular food! \u00a0Thanks you Juanito and Pinotxo! \u00a0I will never forget your delicious food and warm hospitality. \u00a0I can't wait to visit you again!",
