    "Really small and crowded, but the food was delicious. I came with a group of seven right in the midst of dinnertime (8-10pm ish) and we had to stand around for around 20-30 minutes before we were able to get a table. If you're just dropping in for a snack, though, standing at the bar and just ordering there is also an option. Get there early if you want to get a seat!Highlights included the goat cheese stuffed peppers, chorizo, potatoes (with some kind of mayo and cheese and chorizo on top - forgot what it was called, though!), and jam\u00f3n. Price adds up fairly quickly; we paid around 125 euros for the seven of us, including several glasses of cava (which is a must-try - only had a few sips of it from a friend's glass, but I definitely recommend it!) and beer. Not cheap, but reasonable.Overall - food is great, worth a try if you're in the area and don't mind getting real cozy with the rest of the people in the restaurant.",
