    "Wandering around the neighbourhood looking for food after a drink at Terra d'Escudella was not an easy task. I was so glad that my Yelp friend suggested that we go Le \u00a0Sants for some seafood.Le Paradea Sants is like a self served fish market restaurant. You would see fresh uncooked seafood displayed on ice and just pick whatever you like and how much you want and how you want that to be prepared. I was quite happy to try some of the seafood that I saw in the markets we visited!We shared:Ca\u00f1aillas - Sea SnailsGambas a la planche - Grilled ShrimpsNavaja - Razor ClamsAll I can said that they were all fresh and delicious. A good experience for any seafood lover!",
