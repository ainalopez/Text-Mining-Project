    "I thought I would never eat another sandwich as delicious as Ike's Place sammies in the bay area (still have yet to find anything as good in NYC), but the ham sandwich at Cafe Viena gets close.My boyfriend insisted that we come here after he read Mark Bittman's \"best sandwich in the world\" review. For such a simple formula - just ham with some mayonnaise on bread - the sandwich tasted much better than I would have expected. Definitely check it out -- maybe not the best sandwich in the world, but no doubt great for its simplicity.We also got some fries - nothing to gloat about. The ham sandwich is where it's at.",
