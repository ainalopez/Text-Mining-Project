    "Love this place! Live right next to it so it's super convenient for me. But that's not what keeps me coming back. Rather it's the friendly and Laidback staff, the chill vibes, and the amazing food. Being from the us I'm glad to find this place has hefty portions that fill me up. Anyways, would highly recommend.",
