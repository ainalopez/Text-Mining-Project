    "Cinc Sentits was supposed to be one of the best restaurants in Barcelona, and I was so disappointed... Especially after looking at the pricetag at the end of the meal. (I'd rather spend a lil bit more and eat at Alinea again, for almost the same price).We got the 8 course tasting menu. The amuse bouche was a maple syrup shot, and that was really good. Theres was a soup that was good, but it didn't wow me. The only other dish that I thought was amazing was the carmelized large piece of foie gras. I think my friends and I would all agree that the foie gras was definitely the best part of the meal. The desserts were forgettable, nothing spectacular. I heard great things about Cinc Sentits, but it just didnt cut it for me...",
