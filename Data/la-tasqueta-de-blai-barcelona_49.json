    "1E pinoxto? 1.50E glass of cava, filled to the brim? Count me in! This fun spot offers a good variety of small bites and drinks that won't break the bank. We came during peak dinner time so there was a lot of elbow to elbow dining, but I loved the hustle and bustle. Our favorites were the simple sausage with creamy mustard sauce and the salmon. This is close to Apolo, so get your grub on and go clubbing to work off those calories ;).",
