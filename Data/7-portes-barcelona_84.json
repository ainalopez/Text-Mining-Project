    "If you are looking for a restaurant service as you are getting in America then do not visit this place. This is a traditional Spanish or actually Catalan restaurant. You will have an experience of a good restaurant in Spain where waiters and service is kind of different. They will not come ask you how is your meal but they will not remove the plate off your table once one of you is finished with his meal. Paella is not one of my favorite dishes but after some years of trying it in several places it is safe to say that 7 portes serves one of the best. Very old place. Part of it has names of political figures, famous writers, actors etc that have been served. It is more than 200 years old and you see some names that are long gone as well as some current presidents athletes etc. There are also private rooms to dine for parties that want to be left alone.",
