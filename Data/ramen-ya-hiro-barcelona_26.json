    "Random find in the middle of Barcelona. Chef was definitely Japanese and he loves his 70's pop music. Lots of fun to watch him prepare his ramen. Everything is quite reasonably priced (see menu pictures). Flavor was excellent but broth was a bit thin for my taste - I had the miso so maybe the soy is thicker?Would go back again.",
