    "I'm always suspicious when I check the Yelp reviews for a place and find that barely any locals have reviewed it. But this place was wonderful.Firstly, a quick definition of pintxos stolen from Wikipedia: \u00a0'A typical snack of the Basque Country and Navarre, \"pinchos\" consist of small slices of bread upon which an ingredient or mixture of ingredients is placed and fastened with a toothpick, which gives the food its name \"pincho\", meaning \"spike.\"' For anyone not familiar with the pintxo set up: You take what you like, each individual toothpick you end up with will cost \u00a31.60 at the end. Straightforward enough. The range on offer here is great. We pulled up some stools at the bar and got down to business sampling everything that we cold find. As we were there before 10 it wasn't possible to order anything hot off the menu, but once it hit 10 we were told we could.I won't go into what's on offer, there's so much that I can't remember. The range goes from brie and mixed berry to blood sausage scrambled eggs and includes everything in between so you're sure to find something you like. As pintxos go it was s decent price for the quality of what was on offer. The staff were nice, clearly run off their feet and only a handful had English but often an explanation of the food would be given to us in catalan whether we understood it or not. The beer was served in a 'traditional' 330ml glass while my cidre was served at about 100-150ml per glass, but you don't need much more!Overall the meal came to about \u00a312 a head and we were stuffed so great value!",
