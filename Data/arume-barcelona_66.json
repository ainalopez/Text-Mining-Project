    "This is a sister restaurant to Cera 23 which we went to last evening. \u00a0Amazing food at a more than reasonable price. \u00a0If you are a foodie this is a must. \u00a0We started with the three (3) appetizers/tapas which included the fried octopus, Galacian tacos, and ceviche. We could have stopped there and had been completely satisfied but decided to take the plunge and each order an entree...red tuna and lamb. Whoa!!! Let me say, we didn't need dessert because each dish was a dessert in it's own right. \u00a0Now we hear, there is a 3rd restaurant that they have just opened (Viana). \u00a0So we may just make it over there before we have to go back to the US.",
