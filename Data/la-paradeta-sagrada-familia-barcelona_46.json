    "The best place to get,literally, fresh seafood! We arrived 15min before it opened and already there was a line! Highly recommend getting there early! The way it works is, you pick out your seafood (price is per Kg but can order less), tell them if you want it steamed, fried, in tomato sauce...then you sit and wait for your food to be cooked. Self service, reasonably priced and much cheaper than eating on La Rambla. We ate 7 dishes, drinks, bread and all the sauces for \u20ac95 which included a \u20ac9 service/tip (automatic based on your tab). This is pretty cheap in Europe esp for the amt of food we got.",
