    "My wife and I wanted something different after eating tapas for the past week and a half. \u00a0This spot was a few doors down from the apartment we were renting in the Gothic quarter, and seemed to have great reviews. \u00a0We weren't disappointed. \u00a0My wife had a Roquefort salad, that she really liked, and I had a nicely grilled steak with potatoes. \u00a0All in all, a great meal.",
