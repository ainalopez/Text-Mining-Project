    "We sat outside at a lovely table. \u00a0The food was delicious. \u00a0We had:BIKINI de \"CARLES ABELLAN\" - this was basically high end grilled cheese finger sandwiches with truffle and ham. \u00a0So tasty!Pan con Tomato- it was simply bread and tomato and it was so good I spent the rest of my time in Barcelona trying to find a similar version.Ceviche- very classic peruvian high end style. \u00a0Great presentation and very fresh.Fried canned sardines - so tasty and flavorful and not at all fishy. A little addictive. Jamon iberico - best version of this we had until we got to Seville. Ham croquetas - typical version of these. \u00a0Very good.",
