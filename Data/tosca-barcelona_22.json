    "With only 2 days in Barcelona, me and my wife wanted to enjoy all the Spanish food we could with such limited time. This place was just perfect. ambience is very nice and romantic. We started off with a pitcher of Sangria. I've never had a more refreshing and tasty sangria. The tapas were fantastic! The chorizo was very tasty and I personally don't like foie gras but my wife enjoyed the foie gras with brie. The goat cheese salad is enough for two and it was very fresh and filling. You can't go wrong with patatas bravas, crispy and delicious. The empanadas were my favorite with melted cheese and caramelized onions inside left me wanting more. It's not too pricey, the service was great and the food was fantastic.",
