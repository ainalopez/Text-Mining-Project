    "I went to this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 8 and though we were immediately sat at a large round table in the middle of a lovely, strange space, we all left extremely disappointed because of the length of time we waited for our food. We entered the restaurant at a regular time to eat and the place was not at all full. Yet we waited a while (10-15 minutes) for a server to take our drink orders and when we finally put in our food orders (appetizers to share and an entree for each), we ended up waiting literally 1.5 hours for our appetizers and another 45 mintues for the entrees. What was most bizarre is no one from the restaurant came to explain why the wait was so long or offered anything (like a tapa or a free drink) to appease our frustration. When the food finally came out of the kitchen, everything was pretty tasty, but not at all worth the 2-3 hour wait. I hope this was an atypical day at El Foro.",
