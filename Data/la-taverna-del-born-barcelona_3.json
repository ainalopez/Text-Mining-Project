    "Delicious patatas bravas, a welcome surprise in a location that could easily be quite the tourist trap. I've sampled a burger, some calamari etc. but I would stick with some pan con tomate and the bravas for an appetizer or afternoon snack because they have been consistently solid while the rest is decent to good. \u00a0Grab a spot out front and watch the tourists and passersby out in the Passeig de Born!",
