    "Before heading to La Sagrada Familia we stopped here for some classic churros con chocolate. The reviews were right - the churros were perfectly crispy without being too sweet. The chocolate was nice and thick, perfect for dipping the churros and even sipping! DEFINITELY get some breakfast here before visiting the basilica. My only regret was not trying the different \"versions\", especially the dulce de leche filled one. Then again, you can never go wrong with the original.",
