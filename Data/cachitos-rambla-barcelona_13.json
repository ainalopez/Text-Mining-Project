And setting, and setting, while we looked at her with that \"ready\" look. \u00a0I mean, we couldn't believe this, since we were her only customers. \u00a0Finally she came over to us...we ordered their \"chicken\" tapas, only to be served little round fried balls of God knows what-a slimy wet interior that was ice cold in the middle. The onion soup was ok, nothing special. \u00a0But we'll never forget the rude server (youngish, 20 something, long dark hair). This was on April 1, 2016, about 2 pm.",
