    "Service - waited 5 mins to be seated. After ordering, food arrived in 10 minutes. Server was very pleasantFood - ordered eggs Benedict and the Jackie hamburger - roasted potatoes as you would expect - crispy on the outside and very soft inside. Poached eggs cooked perfectly. You can taste the cheese in the auntie burger as well. Bloody Mary was exceptional. Definitely recommend.Atmosphere - lots of tourists but very energetic and cozy space with ample room to eat. Great decorOverall, a blend of American spanish flavours catered towards a more American style of breakfast food.This is like a little nook of Barcelona connecting you a bit outside of its traditions.The espresso was excellent too.",
