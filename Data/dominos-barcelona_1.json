    "I entered slowly with my yorkie and they welcomed me in to order. They helped me order since my spanish is not so great and gladly took care of me offering me to sit and wait. 10 minutes and I had my thin crust Hawaiian styled pizza. Nice and hot with a nice and cold pepsi. \u00a010\u20ac . I would go back if I wasn't leaving so soon.",
