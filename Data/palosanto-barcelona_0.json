    "This is the best tapas we've had in Barcelona all week. It was easy to get an early reservation, and there seems to be plenty of outdoor seating in the courtyard behind the restaurant, though we chose to sit inside. \u00a0This chicken croquettes were freshly fried and crispy. \u00a0My daughter, who claims to not like eggplant, actually enjoyed the fried eggplant with honey. \u00a0The burrata cheese and fig salad did not fail to disappoint; the pesto sauce was a nice touch. \u00a0One of our favorite dishes was the streaky bacon, David Chang-style. We are big fans of David Chang so we had to have this. \u00a0We were in heaven. \u00a0This dish is reminiscent of Peking Duck without the duck. \u00a0Don't miss this!!The tuna belly with tomato and cucumber was OK, not that memorable. \u00a0(The tuna actually tasted like canned tuna.) \u00a0Bread with tomato sauce was a hit; the bread was crispy and warm.We loved the salmon tartare. \u00a0By the time our last dish came, the cod confit, we were full but still enjoyed the dish. \u00a0We were not tempted by the dessert menu and decided to pass. \u00a0The house ros\u00e9 wine was a delightful complement to all the dishes.",
