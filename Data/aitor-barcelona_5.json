    "Great little spot just a spit away from the Sagrada Familia Cathedral, which if you don't know what that is, then you haven't been to Barcelona. \u00a0This place introduced me to Tapas. \u00a0I opted for the buffet, which was a bargain considering how hungry I was. \u00a0Some of the tapas included fresh fish which are housed in glass with temperature control to keep fresh. \u00a0Staff was exceedingly friendly. \u00a0And if your looking for good english speaking, stay home. \u00a0I visited three countries and tried my hand at Italian, French and Spanish and got everything I needed. \u00a0Top grade especially considering convenience to a tourist site, low cost relatively speaking (once again, very close to a major tourist site, think about it!) , and speed of the meal when you opt for the buffet!",
