    "very good service! yelp said it would close at \u00a02, but when we ordered they said they'd close soon (we were there 6min before 1). we were told not to worry, it was just for information, no need to hurry. only stayed for that one drink and a toilet visit (which was clean) but would recommend as it seemed clean and service comes with a smile :)",
