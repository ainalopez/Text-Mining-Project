    "Really 4.5 stars and really worth a visit. let me put it this way - if I come back to Barca I will definitely come back here.Ambience: Okay, so it's like a strip-mall Chinese place and you're definitely not going there for a date night. Service: Another reason for not getting 5 stars. Quite possibly some of the worst staff I've ever come across, but stay with me...Food: Absolutely incredible. This is pretty much all I care about at most restaurants and here it was second to none. The first day I dropped in for a quick meal because it was near my hotel and just had the dumplings in broth (Sopa de Jiao Zi). They were amazing, and looking at the menu I saw loads of interesting choices that made me curious to try it again. When I came back I tried the frogs legs (Ancas de ranas soja) and another dish with razor-back clams (Navaja Cebolleta Jen). Let me just say that if you've never had frogs legs this dish is where you want to change that. Really. Go there just for that. It was delicious. The clams were nice too - in a somewhat unexpectedly sharp vinegar/soy sauce but excellent.Price: You can get really and truly stuffed for 5-15 euro depending on what dishes you order.When you want a break from tapas this really is worth the visit.",
