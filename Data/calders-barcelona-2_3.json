    "Having been recommended this place by a local, I had expectations of a good meal, but was extremely disappointed by the food and lack of value for money. It seemed like most people around us were drinking not eating, and I guess we should have done the same. The worst example of what we ordered were the chicken nuggets special - 4 dry, small pieces of chicken for Eur 6.9. McDonald's would have been tastier and cheaper. You might say it was our fault for ordering chicken nuggets, but the waiter had effusively recommended them to us. Unequivocally the worst meal we had during our four days in Barcelona.",
