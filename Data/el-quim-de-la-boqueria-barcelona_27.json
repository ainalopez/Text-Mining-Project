    "My rating is more the overall experience than just the restaurant, because the two are inseparable. Overall this is a great place, just be ready for some chaos and to spend restaurant money on a meal at essentially a (albeit charming) stand. The food was delicious. service was friendly and helpful, but one of our main dishes came out much earlier than the other. Dishes were pricey, expect to pay 20-30 euros each. But drinks were reasonable. Getting a seat is a challenge, and people will cut in front of you so it's kinda a competition. While we were eating something hit the stand causing a glass to fall from the overhead rack right towards us - we found ourselves concerned about glass shards (!). A delicious, fun, mini train wreck overall. Lol!",
