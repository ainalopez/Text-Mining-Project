    "Touristy prices but the food is fantastic. The people who work behind the counters don't speak much English, but they are good with letting you know what is fresh and what you shouldn't get when it's not fresh. We went there pretty early in the morning (11:30am) so we didn't have trouble getting a seat. We asked for:- gamba con huevos (shrimp with eggs) because someone else got them and it looked and smelled delicious (6 euros!) Those eggs were the best!- stewed beef cheeks (12 euros!), - 4x croquettas (4 euros) (SO GOOD) - octopus (6 euros). \u00a0They throw you a small piece of bread onto the counter, which is a bit unsanitary bit i personally didn't mind. The four dishes worked out to be 28 euros after tax, which is not very cheap, but it was probably the best place in which i ate in Barcelona.",
