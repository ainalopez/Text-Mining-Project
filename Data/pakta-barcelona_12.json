    "Maybe I will be the only one but I have found Pakta a very disappointing experience. I didn't enjoy it at all. I was expecting a wow factor at every dish (as with the other restaurants of the group) and instead I have barely liked some dishes. I have found the Galician's beef carpaccio mixed with Ponzu sauce an horrible mix that didn't work at all. Most of the time waiters don't even let you enjoy your food cause they are taking your plate away with rush and then immediately clean the table. I understand is a menu, lots of dishes and little time, but this feeling of having a rush it is very annoying.",
