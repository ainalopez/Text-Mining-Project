    "Intimidating? At first. Worth it? Every damn time.If you want a less touristy place, this is more authentic than your average bar on La Rambla and cheaper than any on Passeig de Gracia. You can't really go wrong if you're here. But here's how you can go right: Go to the bar to order, since it's a rather organized chaos in this little gem. Have cava rose to drink, accompanied with platters of chorizo (my favorite in all of Spain), queso, and croquetas. If you're feeling for something more substantial, get a sandwich. So much nom.During the day you can buy bottles of the cava for CHEAP, so DO IT. Lived in Barcelona for a while and this place never got old. Sober up on a walk through Barceloneta, or sober up with more bread and ham. I don't care how long you're visiting: Xampanyeria is a MUST in BCN. I don't care how disorganized it looks. I don't care how bad your Catalan and/or Spanish is. I don't care how scared you are at the door. Go and conquer.I would give 1,000,000 stars if I could.",
