    "Highly recommend this spot. I went here twice in a matter of a week while in Barcelona. I recently lived there for six weeks and this was my favorite spot not only because of the excellent food but the atmosphere and decor as well. \u00a0The Burrata with pesto and tomato is delicious, as are the patatas bravas, grilled vegetables and steak tartar. Five stars!",
