    "This is a generic Cinco Jotas review as i went to two in Barcelona (one at the rooftop of a mall and another on a popular major street where you could sit in a terrace in the middle of the street). I enjoy Cinco Jotas. It is a nicer (but still inexpensive for North American standards) establishment serving solid food. i find food in spain can be a bit inconsistent (the romantic ideal of tapas doesn't always translate to execution) but Cinco Jotas does it consistently and I'm happy to pay closer to north american prices for the beautiful settings and enjoyable meals.And of course this is one of the venues (amongst many) where my love for Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico de bellota was born. oh the dangers of travelling ;)",
