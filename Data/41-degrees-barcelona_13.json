    "We stopped by during our last trip to Barcelona. Easily one of the best meals we had in all our travels. When we first arrived there was a huge line, so we sat outside at the counter, which was pretty awesome if you ask me. You get a birdseye view of everything inside an out, and you get to enjoy the cool evenings breezes as well. Best dish of the night, by far, was the Parmesan ice cream. So simple, yet so satisfying. Make it your business to get here if you're ever in Barcelona!",
