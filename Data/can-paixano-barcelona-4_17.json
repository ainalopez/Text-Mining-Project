    "This place rocks! Everything one menu is good and well priced. The CAVA, especially the pink Cava freaking amazing! Go early to beat the crowd and enjoy. Can be tough to order your food depending on how packed the place gets, so squeeze yourself to the bar. And if the bearded dude is there, avoid that dude...he gets easily irritated with too many people ordering.",
