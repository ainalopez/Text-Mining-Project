    "This is a fantastic restaurant and concept for seafood lovers. You enter to what appears to be a fish market. However you pick your seafood and they prepare it for you! \u00a0You pay for your meal and pick your beverage. You're assigned a number and you seat yourself. They call your number as the food is prepared. Seems a little fast food like in process, but it is nothing like that in reality. We had monk fish soup to start followed by lightly fried chipirones, which are like small whole calamari. We then had lightly grilled octopus and prawns. DELICIOUS!Accompanied by a couple of beers it was a fantastic light and delicious lunch! \u00a0Note - they close for siesta at 4pm. Enjoy!!",
