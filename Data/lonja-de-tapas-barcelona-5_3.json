    "One of the best food experiences I had in Barcelona. Stumbled upon this place while looking for dinner around 10 pm. Very clean and brightly lit, and fast service! Standouts:SANGRIA: we got pitchers of both the red wine and the sparkling (white). Both were delicious and very strong. Careful!BOMBAS: one of the BEST things I've ever put in my mouth. Meatball surrounded by potato, deep fried and with a garlic tomato sauce. OMG. We tried finding this in other tapas places but couldn't.. I want to go back to Spain just so I can eat this. SEAFOOD PAELLA: Outstanding, and a huge portion. We ordered the 2-person portion to share with 4 people, and it was still massive! I'm not a huge fan of rice but I couldn't stop stuffing my face with the paella. Wish it had more prawns/shrimp but overall it was great.CROQUETTES/KROKETS: Dutch staple done very well here. They tasted as fresh as a croquette could taste (after being deep fried.. lol) and I think they said something about the ham being handmade here (or something).PATATAS BRAVAS: We ordered this everywhere we went. Outstanding.Overall good service and great prices for quality food.. and convenient location in the Born district, near the Picasso museum. Wish I could come back sooner than later! Dreaming about this food every night. Much love from California!",
