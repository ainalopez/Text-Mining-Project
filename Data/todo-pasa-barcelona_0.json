    "We dined at Todo Pasa upon the recommendation of our hotel. It is way off the beaten path in Barcelona but proximate to our hotel on a rainy night. Several of the reviews on trip advisor claimed this to be the \u00a0best meal they had ever experienced. Expectations were therefore high and Todo Pasa delivered! It is a quaint little hole in the wall of the neighborhood adjacent to Montjuic, with only seven tables in the main dining room (there seemed to be a back private room also). We each ordered the specialty of the house -imported Argentine steak - mine a sirloin and hers a filet. We also had a bottle of Cataluyan red wine. The steaks were out of this world good. Not like those you get at high end steakhouses in US which are typically seared at super high heat and charred on the outside. These were succulent and flavorful throughout. Prices were 30 euros each steak and a mere 14 euros for the wine. That is before the 30% discount for reserving online through trip advisor.Please note, this establishment being primarily frequented by locals, it does not open until 8pm. Last reservation is at 11:30pm. Service was not particularly warm, but may have been only that our server did not speak much English... Nevertheless, This hidden gem was well worth the wait for dining late!",
