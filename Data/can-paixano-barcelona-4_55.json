    "Busy busy little place but once you have some cava (red!) and snack, you'll know why it's so popular. Currently there's construction on the street so it doesn't even look like it's open but don't worry, it is (as of April 2014). I would have stayed here all afternoon drinking the cheap cava (\u20ac2, I think?) and nibbling on tasty pork products if it weren't for my friend who made me leave. Don't know what else to say except def make this a stop when you're eating in Barcelona.",
