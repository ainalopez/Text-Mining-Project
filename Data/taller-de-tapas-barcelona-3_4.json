    "Best thing you can do for yourself is to not come here. Service was uncomfortable as soon as we stepped in. Guy who seated us thought he was being super funny saying \"Konnichiwa\" to me. I'm Chinese. Okay, honest mistake; he's just being friendly.On the other hand, waiter wouldn't let us order a larger main (paella) without ordering tapas first. We didn't want tapas. He literally didn't let me order my food until we ordered a couple plates of tapas. Then, after we finally get our order taken, and I get my paella order in, he tries to upsell us like a sketchy hairdressers' might try to sell you expensive hair masks while cutting your hair. We don't need bread with olive oil on it; sorry, not sorry.Tapas are tiny portion sizes, especially considering the prices. I am the exact opposite of impressed with this place.",
