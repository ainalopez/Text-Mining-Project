    "Solid pub experience just off of Las Ramblas. It's the perfect spot to view EPL matches while in Barcelona, and while we were there we watched Arsenal and Liverpool both blow it, which was enjoyable and only added to the experience as everyone was in to the game. I went with a group of eight, and experienced great service and filling portions of Irish fare. Prices were great in comparison to what you get on Las Ramblas just one street over. If I'm in Barcelona again and looking to watch the game, this is the first place I will check.",
