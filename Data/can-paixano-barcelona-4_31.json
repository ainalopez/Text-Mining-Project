    "Situated close to Barcoleneta beach, this cava bar is well known for its 5 euro bottles of cava, Catalonian champagne. Beware if you don't like crowds, because this place is jammed packed like canned sardines and you must gently nudge your way up front to get a spot by the bar. I found the tapas, mostly cured meats, cheese, sandwiches, and croquettes, offerings to be just average and none of the plates stood out. Having said that, I would definitely visit this lively bar mid-day for a couple bottes of dirt cheap cava and snacks.",
