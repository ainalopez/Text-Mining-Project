    "This is a place where you go because you're near the end of your trip and you desperately need something different. \u00a0If you go with the expectation of it being fusion then you'll be fine. \u00a0The pho ga has grilled chicken breast in it. \u00a0The broth is tasty enough and it probably would work better with the beef pho. \u00a0It's the same chicken you find in their rice vermicelli dish. But you pair that with a 4E margarita frappe (blended) and it's all good.",
