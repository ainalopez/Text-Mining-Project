    "Our host, a Barcelona-born native, brought us here for dinner during our one-week stay. It was truly the culinary highlight of our trip.I have no idea what I ate - Sergi ordered for us. The plates just kept coming, and it was all outstanding. The wine, the tapas, the interior, the service, all of it - outstanding.I would recommend, though, that unless your young children are extremely adventurous eaters, that you fill them up before you come here.",
