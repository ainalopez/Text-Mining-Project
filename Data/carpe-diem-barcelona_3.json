    "This place was fantastic!!! Despite its touristy rep.. Which I try to stay away from on vacation.. It was great. I had sampled some sushi from across Spain and the quality was good but not great except for here!! It was awesome! The ambience was nice and calm similar to the Buddha bar in Paris.... Dark romantic. With great music. My boyfriend and I being huge fish lovers decided to order in bulk, we got the 30 piece sushi. Which was great it originally came with four varieties of fish but we were able to mix the quantities to our liking.. Aka 15 tuna and 15 salmon. IT MELTED IN OUR MOUTH. We then decided to order things separately I got a bowl of miso while my boyfriend got Chilean Sea bass cooked to perfection. All the while there were complimentary massages for us while we ate!!! If that's not an awesome restaurant I don't know what is!!!!!! The massages are technically free but tips are apreciated between 10-20 dollars:) they were fantastic and I wish I had a place like this back home!!!!",
