    "We dined at Montiel our last night in Barcelona and it was the perfect ending to our time there! The restaurant is really small and cozy, probably only fits max 25 people? The food was amazing! Its served family style, but there was plenty of food for everyone (8 of us). One of the first dishes was Tuna Tartar, and I usually dont eat raw fish, but their Tuna tartar was amazing! Perfectly flavored.. Mmm! From what I remembered, pretty much everything was really good. I loved their desserts. One was a creamy dessert made from goats milk, and the flavor was perfect, not too pungent (sometimes goat cheese/milk can be overwhelmingly strong). Some of my friends still didnt care too much for it, so I practically had it all to myself! Mmmm! The staff was wonderful and made us feel right at home. This was definitely a 5 star experience, food and service! (I'd rather dine at Montiel three times over, than for the price of one meal at Cinc Sentits...)",
