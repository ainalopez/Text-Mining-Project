    "The fact that my friends and I came here for dinner for three nights out of our stay should tell you a lot. Such a cool set up, dark wood, open restaurant area with bar seating and multiple tvs showing world cup games... yeah... we loved this place! They have amazing self serve tapas for 1.50 euro each, which they keep track of by the number of sticks left on your plate. We ate SO MUCH FOOD and drank SO MUCH WINE (well, to be fair, I was drinking vodka, which is pronounced WODKA, and no... they really won't understand if you say vodka) and we only paid 20 euro each. I highly, highly recommend this place!!!",
