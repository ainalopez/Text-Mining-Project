    "This place was so incredibly delicious!! We got a few different tapas and they were amazing. We got a bottle of wine which was only \u20ac10 and was a pretty good house wine. We got the cheese croquettes which were blue cheese and delicious. We also got the fried mussels which were also really amazing. The fried peppers were also tasty. They were only slightly spicy and so incredibly tasty. We also had dessert. We got a delicious fruit mousse and a vanilla custard that was kind of like a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but a little thinner consistency. I would highly recommend this place!!!",
