    "The minute we landed and dropped off our luggage at the hotel, what did we do? We went tapas hunting. Found Cuidad Condal on Yelp and was definitely happy with the selection.It is recommended to go early or reserve because these spanish people hibernate during the day and come out at night. The line up was ridiculous and knowing the way tapas style works, you can order while standing and waiting. So everyone is rushing to the tapas counter and elbowing their orders. We managed to find seats along the tapas bar area rather then dining but that was what I consider a better choice. The wait for a table was going to leave me sleepless at night and plus I was hungry from a long flight. It wasn't until we had a few bumps and bruises from these ladies that were very aggressive and mean, when we finally got a seat. Wouldn't be the same without going through this anyways.Once seated we had to figure out what we wanted to eat. So what we did was just kept pointing. Had no idea what we were ordering. None of it was regretful at all. Be careful of what you order and how much you order. You may think tapas food are bite size but after a few you get full. I made the big mistake of letting my stomach think too large and order almost $80's worth of tapas. Not doing that again.One dish i will remember the most is the Foie Gras sandwich. It was literally a small 6 inch baguette FILLED with foie gras pate. Rich rich pate. It was good to start but almost wanted to hurl after almost finishing it. I failed! Their sangria was the freshes i've ever had but i don't know if it was the best since we were in spanish territory.Despite the pushing and shoving and big bill, i definitely enjoyed my experience there. Will come again... when i reclaim my patience.",
