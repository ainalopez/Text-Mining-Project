    "Was getting a little bit tired of the tapas bars here in the area and went to check out the place since it got such great reviews.Awesome service! She explained the entire menu to us and made several recommendations.They do all the cooking in house and from scratch.The food is very good and the portions are pretty decent as well.We had pasta and ravioli which came with a drink as well as a dessert as well. (Brownie and a Dulce De Leche cake.)We also tried an empanada (the owners are Argentina n's with Italian background) and they were pretty good as well.We also liked the interior and the feel of the place.The place is a little bit hidden and the alley ways are a bit dark and dodgy but the place is definitely worth the search!",
