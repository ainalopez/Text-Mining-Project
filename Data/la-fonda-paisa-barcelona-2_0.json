    "Food was amazing, especially if your looking for a good hearty, make you feel all warm inside meal ;). Portions were enormous which absolutely makes up for the higher cost, about 11-13\u20ac per dish. Also majority of the items come with a delicious soup and a side salad. We waited a bit for the food (which is the only reason i took of a star), but when the food came it was 100% worth the wait. A must try even if you need to travel a bit to get there!",
