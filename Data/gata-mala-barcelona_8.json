    "Our first night in Barcelona, and it won't be beat! The tapas at Gata Mala were incredible (special shout-out to the Chori, which was the highlight, but everything we had was fantastic) but the friendliness and accommodation of the staff was second to none. I hope we get back here in our short trip because it was terrific. Go here and make a reservation, you won't be sorry!",
