    "This place is a testament to the fact that Barcelona has no fire safety codes. \u00a0There is literally no place to walk without touching another person. \u00a0Over half the people eating there are eating standing up, but sharing tables is considered taboo as the owner explained when we offered to share one of the coveted tables we had awaited for over an hour. \u00a0\"People in Barcelona do not like this\". \u00a0And 5 minutes later he added a couple Japanese tourists to our table :)All that said, this place is completely worth the wait and hassle. \u00a0The house sparkling wine is among the best I've had. \u00a0There is no menu that I could find. \u00a0People order by pointing at each other's food. \u00a0So go ahead look and point at other people's plates without shame - completely acceptable!Some of the standout dishes for us were the peppers with pork, the sausage with chick peas, and the dessert sampler.",
