    "Not full of tourists, although there were certainly enough of them, but also locals! \u00a0Great service, tapas was fantastic and different and so many varieties.... I also had a salad and it was amazing. \u00a0Wine recommendation was perfect. \u00a0Fun place, either the upstairs where it is only tapas or downstairs with tapas and ala carte!",
