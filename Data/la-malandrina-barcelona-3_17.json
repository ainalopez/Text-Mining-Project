    "This could be a redundant review as I found this place on Yelp, and agree with the previous raving reviews.I knew this was the real deal when the LatAm chimichura was put on the table. \u00a0 Made me regret not ordering some grilled chorizos. \"I spent some time in Argentina\" to try with the chimichura. Great food for value. Sirloin in large portion was 8.50 e. quality excellent. However, expect to wait for a table. I waited in January. Can only imagine what July is like.",
