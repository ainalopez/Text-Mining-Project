    "You do kind of get tired of the tapas and the salivation for some red meat does take over. So what's better than steak prepared as if you're in Buenos Aires? Loved Parillas Alfonsina. Don't get concerned if you don't see too many tables filled inside - seems like they just don't eat big in Spain. But this is the place to have one of the best pieces of beef anywhere - including Capital Grille and The Palm - and at amazing prices. Food - Excellent. Service - Average Ambiance - average. For you Zagat'ers, it's a 27-20-20. Great value. You'll have one of the best cuts of beef (they serve filet mignon (tenderloin), ribeye and sirloin) anywhere. Oh, and a super reasonably priced wine list - not many selections, but enough Malbec or Cabernet to go perfectly.",
