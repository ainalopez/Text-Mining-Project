    "We ordered the Churro's and Chocolate. \u00a0The Churro's were still hot when they came out. \u00a0SOO GOOD! \u00a0I also ordered a chocolate milk shake. \u00a0I took a little sip. \u00a0It was like chocolate heaven. \u00a0Then a few seconds later I look down and it was gone. \u00a0I could have drank a gallon of it. \u00a0My family and I just laughed and laughed about the chocolate milk shake disappearing. \u00a0So obviously, I think you should order a chocolate milk shake!",
