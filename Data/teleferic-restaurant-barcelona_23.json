    "Our first dinner in Barcelona was this wonderful spot not too close to all the action but still convenient. The foie bite was one of the best tastes I have ever enjoyed. Choices that are great but just short of overwhelming. Polite and helpful staff. Very busy on an early Friday night. Glad we made reservations.",
