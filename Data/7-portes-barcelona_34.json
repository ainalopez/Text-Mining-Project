    "I had a very memorable dinner. Appetizers were amazing (Mediterranean anchovies, gnam gnam :) ) , langostines...everything fresh. Then I had paella and crema catalana to finish. It was absolutely superb and I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Barcelona. BN. Our waiter was very professional and attentive.",
