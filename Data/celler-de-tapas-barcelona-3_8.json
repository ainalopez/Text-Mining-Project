    "I popped in here for a late afternoon bite after doing some banking next door. It was not crowded at all yet we still decided to sit inside. The decor is wonderful, clean, modern, and flows throughout the dining room. The waitstaff were pleasant, helpful, and courteous. The offering was unique while holding onto some of the regional classics and delivered in fine execution and attention to detail. These guys really know what they're doing and a good value for the price. You will most certainly not be blown away but you'll not be disappointed either.",
