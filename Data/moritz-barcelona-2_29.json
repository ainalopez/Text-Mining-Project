    "Missing the hipster scene and want to be around the bright young things? Then Fabrica Moritz is the place for you. The food is pretty good if not the cheapest in Barcelona (tip get the smaller portions, not the larger tapas size portions if only two people). The location is great in a converted factory (go to the bathrooms downstairs to really see how amazing the space is-they have events downstairs sometimes).This place is hopping at night and there is a wait if you want to sit at a table. There are bars to stand and have \u00a0drink & food if you don't mind that (very common in Barcelona).Went with a Catalan speaking ex-pat who charmed our server. We had far too much food for two people, a plate of the jamon iberica, potato bravas, fried med. cod, the octopus which I love (I eat grilled octopus in about six places in Barcelona and all but one was excellent, sweet and tender). The pulpo (octopus) was great. We also had the gambas (tiny prawn) which I prefer fried in batter to these but the romesco sauce is great with these.The menu is huge with something for everyone from sandwiches,tapas, canas, pixintos, to fried food and more. The beer menu is extensive and it is a popular crowd with both visitors and young professionals.The service was some of the best I had in Barcelona which has a very relaxed service culture.",
