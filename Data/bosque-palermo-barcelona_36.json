    "Perfect. This place is just perfect. Sangria, grilled seafood, paella--they all hit the spot. It's a Saturday night, so this place was crowded and we had to sit outside. \u00a0It's still winter here, but it was okay because they big heaters near the tables. The sangria was probably the best I had here in my stay in Barcelona. It had the perfect blend of sweetness and spirits, without being too overwhelming. The grilled seafood platter is every seafood lovers dream. They were grilled to perfection and definitely not dry. And you can't complain about the price with it being about \u20ac16-18.The paella was loaded with mixed seafood and was so delicious.This place is a must-go for anyone visiting here in Barcelona.",
