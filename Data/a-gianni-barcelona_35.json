    "Buffalo mozzarella pizza is to die for. The caprese is divine and the staff is so friendly. Great pizza, pasta wine etc. My favorite restaurant in Barcelona during my semester abroad. Great place to go for a change from typical Spanish tapas and definitely the best pizza in Barcelona. GO! You won't regret it! Getting hungry just thinking about it!",
