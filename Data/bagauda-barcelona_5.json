    "4 tapas for 12\u20ac. Good quality, open on Sundays. Convenient to the H10 Rac\u00f3 del Pi hotel. Calamari, mozzarella, croquettes, good wine, locals present. A good find since most places are closed on Sunday. They are small and should really make better use of Yelp, like posting their hours and providing more info. First search never turned them up and they are right next to our hotel. Vegetarian tapas too!",
