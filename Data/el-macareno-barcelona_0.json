    "This was a random walkby restaurant choice on our first day in Barcelona. They advertised a fixed price tapas menu for \u20ac15. Included came 8 tapas items and a glass of yummy sangria. Included came: patatas bravas (fried potatoes with dipping sauce), fried calamari, chicken strips, fish croquettes (they were black from squid ink and wonderful!), eggplant with goats cheese, breaded and fried brie with jam and nuts, we also had the bread with tomatoes (a typical Catalan starter) but this was just average. The bread felt a bit stale and flavourless. Overall everything was quite yummy and a great start to the vacation! And reasonably priced. The service was also great. Very friendly. Definitely worth a try.",
