    "I will never forget this amazing dining experience.My advice? Make your reservations today. \u00a0Do it. \u00a0The Catalan food was so good that we stayed there until they closed. \u00a0My wife and I spent three weeks touring around Europe (France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain) and this was the best place at which we ate. That includes the incredible culinary delights of Paris and Burgandy. We ALMOST couldn't find the restaurant. \u00a0It's in a tiny square. \u00a0It's a very romantic place.If you go here, eat something with duck liver in it.",
