    "Oh how I long for the days when I could just stop in here for a late, leisurly lunch. \u00a0When my parents lived in Barcelona, I spent many summer afternoons at Tenorio. \u00a0It's right, smack on the main drag, Passeige de Gracia, which could scream tourist trap to some. \u00a0This place is very upscale and classy. \u00a0The decor speaks for itself, and you can see photo's of those who have dined when you walk in -- Spanish politicians, US Presidents, etc. \u00a0This is where the Catalonians come for lunch (or the tourist who won't sh*t bricks when they see the prices... and yes those are in Euro's).Everything we have ever had here has been delicious. \u00a0Most notable their seafood and chicken dishes have been to die for. \u00a0They have a warm goat cheese and spinach salad that I could eat everyday for the rest of my life. \u00a0They also serve sliced french bread with smashed tomato and fresh basil. \u00a0When you walk in, you will see a HUGE hunk of fresh parmassean cheese. \u00a0It's the size of a tire... you want some of that! \u00a0Ask for fresh parmassean to accompany your meal.The wine list is exstensive. \u00a0Those Spaniards are NOT messing around. \u00a0I found a new favorite while dining at Tenorio. \u00a0The Glorioso Rioja will compliment any meal here!!! \u00a0And you can find it at the grocery store inside El Corte Ingl\u00e9s to take a piece of this fabulous restaurant with you!Can't wait to make a trip back to one of my favorite Barcelona hot spots!!",
