    "We stumbled upon El Atril by accident one of our first nights in Barcelona. We got one of the last tables they had and we're excited to enjoy some Spanish tapas. We ordered a pitcher of sangria. It packed a pretty good punch and would definitely recommend it. We went with all the traditional tapas. We loved the calamari, potatas bravas, and tomato bread. Ordered quite a few more as well and we were happy with every other dish. If you want some traditional tapas I would highly recommend Atril. Much better than any touristy restaurant you will go to.",
