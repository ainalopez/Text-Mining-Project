    "Ate here on a recent trip to Barcelona. I read several reviews before going so that I could figure out how to order food. When you get there, you tell the employees at the front counter what seafood you want, how much of it you want, and how you want it cooked. We ordered some mussels, shrimp, and had a salad. The salad was very good. The mussels were pretty big and cooked in a tomato based sauce. They were good. The shrimp was cooked in some green sauce (similar to chimichurri sauce) and were pretty good as well. \u00a0Washing it all down with a glass of San Miguel made for a good lunch. This was probably the freshest seafood we have eaten. While it was not the best seafood I have ever had, this was a good meal. If you plan on going, I would recommend visiting in the late afternoon, right before they close for a few hours. Every other time we walked around (around lunch time or early at night), there was a line out the door. When we went at 3:00 p.m., there was no waiting.If in Barcelona, make sure to try this spot.",
