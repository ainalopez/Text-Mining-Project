    "The staff were great and welcoming. But quite honestly, I thought the food was just ok and I couldn't help but be slightly disappointed. It's basically fast food; you order by picking a pasta, a sauce and topping(s). And I hate to say it but taste was reminiscent of pasta from the grocery store and heated up jar-ed pasta sauce (not saying it was but reminded me of it). My tagliatelle was not al dente and was a bit gummy. It is freshly made however taste-wise it was just not there for me. The prices are very reasonable however. I would say this place would be a great option to take children.",
