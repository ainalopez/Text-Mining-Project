    "This place was great! We went here because we saw something about it online and loved the pictures on their website. We walked all the way from Casa Batll\u00f3 and got here at about 9:30 p.m. The dining area was completely full of men, which was interesting, so we sat at the long counter. This was fine because we wanted to eat pinchos anyway. At first we were not sure how to do this, but after watching for a few minutes, we realized we just needed to go for it, by reaching over people to open the little glass covers and take what we wanted. We didn't really know what everything was just by looking, but it was all good. They kept bringing out hot pinchos and people would take those too. It was fun. We had 12 total, including plenty of fish, foie gras, and blood pudding with red pepper. We are going back tomorrow for more!",
