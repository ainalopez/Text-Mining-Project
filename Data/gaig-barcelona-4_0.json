    "Clean lines...modern feel...the decor sets the stage for traditional Catalonian flavors with a modern twist. \u00a0Staff is wonderfully professional -- as they are in lovely restaurants in Europe -- knowledgeable, and charming. \u00a0On to the food...You can choose from a couple of tasting menus or do as we did -- build your own! \u00a0Tasting menus offer local/traditional options as well as a more robust modern option. \u00a0Both looked lovely but we wanted to taste other item on the menu so we did our own thing...starting with a traditional Catalan soup.Chicken stock with some pasta pieces and a meat ball may not sound very interesting but take it from me: \u00a0there was a lot of flavor packed into this simple amuse bouche. \u00a0That was followed by perfectly grilled calamari foiled with grilled artichoke -- simple, elegant, flavorful. \u00a0The cod croquette -- simple small but perfectly cooked -- packed a punch of flavor while offset by amazing texture...in just one bite! \u00a0Our next course brought tastes of trotters and octopus (both beautiful done) and cannelloni stuffed with beef/pork and staged on a rich truffled sauce. \u00a0Sea bass with aubergine 3 ways brought a full, earthy set of flavors to the table and finally a grilled sole with romanesco, sundried tomato and spinach pur\u00e9e -- beautiful! \u00a0Desert preceded by a cheese course completed a very memorable meal!Impeccable service...beautiful food...and a charming staff -- not much more you can ask for! \u00a0Find this little spot and enjoy the journey they entice you to join. \u00a0Cheers!",
