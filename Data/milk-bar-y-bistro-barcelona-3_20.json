    "Me and my girlfriend went to this place because of all the great words about it here on Yelp. We came with a pretty clear picture about the place; big brunch dishes with a decent price. When we arrived at 10 am the personal greeted us with great genuine smiles and loads of energy. I took milks fry up and my girlfriend took the yoghurt with granola and fruit salad. We where hoping for big plates and we got REALLY big plates. When we left at 11 am the place was very crowded.Over and all this was our by far best breakfast/brunch during our stay here in Barcelona.",
