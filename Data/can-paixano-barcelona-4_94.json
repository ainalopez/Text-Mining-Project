    "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. We were going here after it being suggested to us by a friend. Once we got there the place was so crowded you couldn't get anywhere so we went back outside and regrouped. \u00a0Coming all this way I wasn't about to let a crowd come between me, tapas and champagne with my friends. So we dove in. Ordering was a bit difficult but once we had started it was all downhill. We ordered cheese, ham, chorizo, rose and cava. My favorite was the chorizo. You don't get utensils but you can use toothpicks - true tapas form. All the food was great. The rose was good but I feel the cava is best. And all glasses are filled to the brim! This place is easily one of the favorites in Barcelona and I will be back.",
