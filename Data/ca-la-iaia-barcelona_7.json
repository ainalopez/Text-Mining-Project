    "After looking around Parc Guell, I came into the restaurant with two other people just before 5pm as they were closing. They kindly told us that they would stay open and serve us. The waiter was very nice. We are a group from Canada and did not speak much Spanish. The waiter translated each item on the menu for us and gave us his recommendations as well. The food was delicious. When we asked for waters, the waiter even insisted we get something more expensive as it was included on the menu (btw there is unlimited wine as well). They let us sit there are eat well past their normal closing time. After we left, we felt like we had a steal of a meal considering we had a three course dinner with unlimited wine for \u20ac9,50. I would highly recommend this place.",
