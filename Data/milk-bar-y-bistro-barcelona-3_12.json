    "First time here and I must say I'm impressed! Ordered Eggs Florentine but they messed up in the kitchen (which happens) and made Eggs Benedict instead. They asked if it was okay I got that if they gave me some extra spinach on the side, and it was so good! Asked for extra sauce which I got free of charge. Really service minded and friendly staff - not just to me but all tables. Great place for brunch and a Bloody Mary!",
