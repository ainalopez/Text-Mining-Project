    "Expected sunny weathers, but the clouds came rolling in. The Asian in me wanted noodles to stay warm, so I decided to check out this place. I ordered miso ramen with extra nori/seaweed, maize, and egg. The broth was so good, it was the first time I had a ramen with that much garlic. Since I had a lot of soup left after, I ordered a second serving of just noodles, nori, and chatsu and finished the whole bowl. The extras are .5 to 1 euro each, with the exception of the noodles which was 1.5 euro. The miso ramen itself was around 8 euros, so the pricing is not that expensive.",
