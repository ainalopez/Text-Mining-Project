    "I got the churros with chocolate. Churros were good; there were 6 on my plate and they were sitting next to the frier (though they weren't piping hot when I got them). Chocolate was thick, but I thought it was lacking chocolate flavor. Their silverware didn't seem too clean though! My spoon was definitely not clean before I used it. Average price, average churros. Wish they were freshly fried so they were hot! At least my chocolate was hot. Also, not sure whether quantity too small or didn't portion properly, but my last churro had to mostly do without chocolate. Sad!",
