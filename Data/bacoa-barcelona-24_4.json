    "I'll admit, I ate a lot of burgers while in Barcelona. It's the perfect drunk food.I visited this particular Bacoa location since it was by Plaza Catalunya and close to my hotel. It is also pretty much located on the university campus. It was probably about 1:00am when I stumbled in here after several gin tonics at Bobby Gin. The first thing I noticed is that they have English menus. Yes! Because the last thing I need after several cocktails is to try to translate Spanish. I ordered the La Bacoa burger with grilled chicken substituted for the burger. I also ordered a side of fries. Both were delicious, but I really, really enjoyed my burger. I would have preferred if the bacon was crispier though.Note: They also have all different types of sauces that you can use on your burgers or potatoes as well, not just your regular ketchup.",
