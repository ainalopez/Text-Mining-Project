    "Great spot to come in for a coffee in the front during the day in the must-see category....plaice is well maintained and of course it was the place of Picasso's first exhibition....where the surrealists used to hang out in the late 1800s. However, it was closed for most of the 20th century - it's the bottom floor of a cool buliding. Then, dinner was so-so. Our food came out in about 5 minutes after we ordered, and the duck was barely warm - seemed odd. The Catalan monkfish casserole with mussels had a less than appealing presentation...but all in all the food wasn't bad and our server was pretty good. Makes for a good one-timer when traveling in Barcelona.",
