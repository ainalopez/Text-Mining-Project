    "I like cats and vegan food. Put them together and you get the Cat Bar. Just so you know, there's no actual cats here. The space is tiny so if they're full, they don't allow people to come in. That was the case for us on our last night in Barcelona, but a large group left and we were let in. My boyfriend ordered the spicy \u00a0Mexican vegan burger (not spicy at all but still good) with patatas bravas and I had the special which came with a pumpkin buttersquash soup and a mixed greens and beet salad. \u00a0So good. We topped it off with a beer as well.",
