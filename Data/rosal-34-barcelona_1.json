    "Great Tapas Bar.We found this place wandering around El Poble Sec, and I'm so glad we did - this. place. was.phenomenal and worth every Michelin Guide sticker on the door - tapas wise. The staff - lovely. The wine list - on point. The tapas menu - phenomenal. The tapas were a beautiful blend of traditional tapas and expertly re-imagined dishes. Every single dish we had was so fresh, so vibrant, and absolutely delicious. Rosal34 is a beautiful example of what I love about Spanish food - they let the food speak for itself. Even their tuna tartare, which had an Asian fusion interpretation to it, was expertly created in such a way that the Asian spices did not detract attention away from how fresh and good the star of the dish- the tuna - was. Another highly recommended dish - the asparagus with goat cheese. If you're like me and a diehard fan of goat's cheese - you will love this dish. The asparagus is blanched to perfection and perfectly balances the creamy sharp flavour of the goat's cheese. Absolutely delicious.My one gripe with Rosal34 was unfortunately the dessert menu as it was not up to par with the tapas. As much as I love the innovation in these tapas dishes, I felt the interpretation of some classic dishes like the Cheesecake or the Tiramisu was a bit too liberal for my taste. The cheesecake concept tasted more like a mousse in my book, and the tiramisu lacked that texture that comes from soaking the lady fingers in espresso and amaretto. Overall, great place for tapas and wine - not so much for dessert.",
