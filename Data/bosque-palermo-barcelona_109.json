    "My son and happened to be staying at a nearby hotel, and luckily walked by this fab restaurant. \u00a0And thank goodness we did, as it was the dinner highlight of our short stay in Barcelona. Although neither of us ordered the paella, we loved the grilled and very fresh seafood platter. \u00a0We also tried a Spanish steak of some kind \u00a0(neither of us speak Spanish but trust me delicious!)) cooked perfectly alongside a side of garlicky greens. And of course the house wine... A bargain and a perfect compliment to an outstanding meal!",
