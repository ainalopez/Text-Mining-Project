    "Excellent place, ambiance and food. They were packed the whole time we were there and the service was excellent. Food was awesome. We had the eggs with chorizo, trikini (It was a delicious Sandwich) and croquetas. We are tourist so we had no clue about the menu but the server was very nice to let us not order more than we could eat. And the beer we had was the Peca 3/4 blonde and 1/4 dark)...excellent!",
