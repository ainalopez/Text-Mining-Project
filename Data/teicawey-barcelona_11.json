    "Awesome place. And here's the thing: it's awesome even by New World standards, not the \"I'm so desperate for Mexicali/ TexMex/ Mexican (however you want to call it) anything with spice will taste good at this point\". I've been there. I know.No. I just had a truly great burrito, the Supercarnes, and a bite of another great which I will go back for, the San Pastor. For about 8 euros a pop, you get a huge burrito with all the salsa you want, including a perfectly done guacamole. Most of their salsas seem to be imported, but they are good. The shop is fun as well and full of goodies. Here's a new one: wooden Teicawey silverware. In the end I had a 30 minute burrito high followed by a 15 minute nap.",
