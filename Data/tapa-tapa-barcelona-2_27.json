    "Not my favorite Spanish dining experience to say the least. Got sucked in based on sheer proximity to our hotel alone and needing to pass an hour's worth of time. Sadly, I think the hour would have been better spent doing almost anything else. It's clearly a tourist trap with the prices to match, but unfortunately, not the quality.We were all disappointed by tapas overly saturated with mayonnaise and fillers, seafood items served at room temp and sangria that tasted like Hi-C. And what exactly were we thinking ordering raw oysters here? Shame on us.Ramble a bit further down the Ramblas. Tapa Tapa is a No No.",
