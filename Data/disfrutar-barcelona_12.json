    "This restaurant is an amazing experience. The staff is welcoming, efficient, friendly, professional... I could go on and on about how terriffic they are. And then there's the food. It is not what I would ever prepare myself, but that makes it even better. See other reviews for details on the various courses. Complex flavor that challenge and delight. It is a taste experience that was well worth the 100 Euro price. This made our time in Barcelona memorable",
