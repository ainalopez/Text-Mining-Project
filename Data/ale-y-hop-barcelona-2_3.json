    "The one thing I love about Ale Hop is that they do their own brew! A bit harpy but great beer and lovely environment with some mates!Great variety of choices and if you're like me and can't make up your mind on what to have. Order lots of samplers instead of glasses of beer. I think it might be a little bit of work for the bar tender (so make sure you give a good tip), but at \u20ac0.5 per sample, it's actually not a bad deal to try all 10 beers at a reasonable price (you ended up drinking more than a standard serve anyway).",
