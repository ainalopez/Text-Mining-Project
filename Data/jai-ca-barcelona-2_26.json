    "Great tapas selection- razor clams, breaded mussels, gambas, giant gambas, salty grilled chillies, croquettas, aubergine, whitebait etc etc.. Sangria was way too sweet. Perhaps they could have been a little quicker to clean up after previous diners, but otherwise service was fantastic- multi-lingual, Spanish, English, French, Arabic... The atmosphere is wonderful- locals, and a handful of smart tourists from around europe made for a cool, friendly crowd of all ages. Good value- 06-2011 dinner and lots of drinks for 3- 56Euro! Closes early for BCN- dont try to arrive after 10 and expect to eat...",
