    "I don't see what the big fuss is about this place. \u00a0Yes, you get a huge sandwich for basically nothing it's so cheap. \u00a0But the actual sandwich wasn't all that impressive. \u00a0I got the chicken with all the sauces and toppings, no lentils. \u00a0Was not the best sandwich I've ever had and honestly not worth the wait in the line. \u00a0Yes, the two ladies that work there are very nice, it's true. \u00a0I think the sauces need to be stepped up, they seemed bland to me.",
