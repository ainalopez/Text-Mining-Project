    "A \"running of the bulls?\" That's how crazy crowded the streets get for a spot inside El Xampanyet...Because of it's popularity , I encourage you to arrive early or prepare to wait. I arrived at 6:52pm (they open at 7pm nightly) and the security gates were still locked down and no one was in sight yet, but when I returned just 10-15 minutes later, the bar area was already packed with people (locals always know better) and luckily, one single table left for me and my group to occupy. Within minutes after my arrival and all throughout the evening, stampedes of people surfaced, eagerly waiting for a smidgen of space to dive into some divine tapas and delicious, delicious cava.Must Do's:- House Cava (similar to Champagne)- Prawns (Gambas)- Razor Clams (cannot get these in the States!!)- Spanish Tortilla (actually their name for an omelette made with eggs, potatoes, onions..and so good!)- Ham (Jamon)- Olives stuffed with anchovies- Canned pickled white asparagus- House Dessert w/shots of MuscatLocated steps away from the Picasso Museum...this place can appear hidden during the day....but by nightfall...El Xampanyet is a pleasantly lively, chaotic zoo...in a good way.A \"must try\" when visiting the Born district.",
