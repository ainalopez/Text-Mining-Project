    "We stopped here during a day of shopping in the area and I fell in love with how cute the lay out was. Very Alice and Wonderland! I ordered the Jasmine tea and a slice of apple cake, my sister got a digestive tea and the husband got an Americano (most places we learned here do not have drip coffee so you just order an Americano) and a slice of lemon cake. The cakes were a little on the sweet end but the teas were delicious. we sat for a while and relaxed before we regained more energy to shop around again. Just a side note: we paid at the cash register since most places here accept payment at the table or register.",
