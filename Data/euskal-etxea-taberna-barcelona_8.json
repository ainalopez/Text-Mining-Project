    "Sad to see people complaining about eating here. Do your research on pintxos! To make it clear - pick what you want and save the toothpicks. That's what you're charged for at the end.We came here in the late afternoon and after researching pinxto places to eat at in Barcelona. This one comes highly recommended and it's not hard to tell well. Well located and definitely packed in the evenings. In the early afternoon, not crowded at all. We got our pick of the menu and there is a guy who will walk around with warm croquettes to eat as well.Pinxtos are a little less than 2 euros each and along with cava, it's a nice meal. Recommend to get your pinxto craving.",
