    "I thought it was great! Meats are really fantastic! I had the ham sandwich with melted cheese, now it sounds very simple but man oh man it was delicious! The only thing I was disappointed in was that the only drink to get was what they were serving at that moment which was champagne: red or white. But come to think about it it makes sense as the joint was incredibly packed and to serve everyone a different drink request would be chaotic. Oh and the price was really REALLY cheap me and the hubs ate well WITH champagne for like 8 euros!",
