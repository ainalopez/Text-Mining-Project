    "Came here in search of some paella and were a little disappointed. The decor is very pretty and modern. Our servers were very nice and attentive; however, the paella lacked flavor. The texture was wonderful, but with all the seafood sitting on top, we would have hoped for more shrimp and calamari flavors through out. I am happy we stopped in on our trip, since it is just off las ramblas, but I would not recommend this restaurant to my friends as it wasn't all that memorable.",
