    "We stopped by for a late lunch on our way to walk around the waterfront and head to the aquarium. When we arrived around 3:00 p.m., the place was packed. As we were waiting in the front area, I saw that several plates were being microwaved before being sent out to customers. There was clearly a kitchen in the back, so I don't know why they had to microwave food. Not a good sign.After a bit of a wait, we sat down. The place is small inside, so the tables are tightly packed. It was loud and hard to hear when we were talking to each other. We started off with an order of Bombas. These were very good and the sauce that came with it was a bit spicy, but flavorful. We also ordered the calamari a la Romana, patatas bravas, and chorizo en vino blanco. I think they messed up our order, because we never seemed to get the chorizo dish. Additionally, the waiter gave us a plate of squid that we did not order. All of the food was fried and overly salty. We barely ate any of the other dishes aside from the Bombas as we both started feeling sick from the fried food.I have had plenty of fried calamari and other seafood before. However, it has not previously made me sick. This is definitely not the best seafood place to eat at. If you want some Bombas (which were microwaved), you'll like this place. Otherwise, I did not think the food was very good.",
