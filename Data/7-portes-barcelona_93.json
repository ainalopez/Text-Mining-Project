    "This is the first place i have tried paella, and they have set the bar. \u00a0The paella was great, but what I liked the most was the selection of olive oils that come with the bread. \u00a0They are some of the most flavorful olive oils I have ever had. \u00a0They charge 2 Euro for the bread without asking, but it's for all the bread you can eat. \u00a0So I ate about 4 baskets worth, after my meal of course. \u00a0I don't need to look at the menu, the seafood only paella is where it's at!",
