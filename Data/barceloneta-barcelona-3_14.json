    "Not so impressed expected for the final check. Food was good to ok but not WOW. The beer was really good!!! They were nice enough to \"let us in\" with no reservations. Service was good but not great. We knew it wasn't going to be a cheap place so we had higher expectations. We had some seafood and I had a grilled fish. Don't get me wrong; food was good but not for that price. But after reading a few reviews I was hoping for a nicer dinner and better service. Few times I don't agree with the reviews but this time I have to disagree!!! Oh well... You can't win them all!!!",
