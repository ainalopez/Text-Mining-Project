    "This place has doughnuts! I decided to try it because of all of the amazing reviews on Yelp! and found out that it really is pretty great.It's a really small space, even though it doesn't seem like it because of the decorations. The walls are beautiful white linoleum tiles in brick shape. There are two small bars with tall chairs to sit at if you need to sit at a bar, and a communal table. That's it (now you understand how small it is). Like I said before though, you almost don't notice how small it is, because it is incredibly charming, like they've found the middle ground between classy and homey. The AC is not too high, but a little low for super hot summer days.I had a strawberry sprinkles covered donut, and honestly it wasn't very donut tasting, but it was good. You can't really blame a caf\u00e9 shop in Barcelona for not having super authentic donuts, I mean it hasn't been popular for that long.The lady who was working when I went in was incredibly nice, and helpful. She didn't mind me asking probably a few too many questions than I should have.For all you studiers, I couldn't find any electrical outlets, but the table is perfect for putting a computer on, on laying work on top of. It also seems really safe in terms of leaving your computer on the table, although to be honest, I would never do that anywhere.The music is not too loud or too quiet, it's just right, and also it's good music in and of itselfPeople who come in here are both people who live in Barcelona, and tourists, which gives it a great ambiance, especially since the pricing charts are in friendly Catalan.All in all, satisfactory place, I approve.",
