    "Great place. Great food.Nice workers.Long line at opening time.Good ramen.Broth was deep and made me instantly smile. The noodles were well done, though it wasn't to ultimate perfection, but for Barcelona? I'd say it was perfect. It's hot inside though. Beware. Bring a fan or something. It'll get a little crowded and jammed. Gyoza was great. Miso ramen was awesome. They did complement each other very well. Try the Japanese beer. Sapporo :) No need to explain more, the place sells itself.",
