    "This is an old school kind of restaurant. \u00a0Wait staff is super courteous and accomodating. \u00a0Food is exactly as it should be. \u00a0We had rucola and goat cheese, aubergine and roasted peppers, rich man's paella and meat & vegetable paella. \u00a0All were perfectly executed and tasty. \u00a0We were relatively early in (7:30) and got table immediately without reservation. \u00a0It is October....",
