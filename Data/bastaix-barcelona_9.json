    "Bastaix means \"porter\" in Catalan and is named after the workers who carried stones on their backs from Montju\u00efc to build the Santa Maria del Mar Church right near the restaurant (flickriver.com/photos/ta\u2026). The restaurant is a retro multi-level space (we ate in the basement dining area) with plenty exposed brick and ancient building charm. It's definitely a bit off the beaten path and we ended up here while getting lost trying to find another tapas bar (yelp.com/biz/cal-pep-bar\u2026) in the Gothic Quarter, but we were definitely happy with what we found.All our dishes were delicious from the crisp flatbread topped with sardines, to the Spanish sausages, to the assorted cheeses. We ordered way too much food and threw them for a loop when we asked for our leftovers to go. There was much hushed talking and pointing and eventually they decided on wrapping stuff in aluminum foil. I guess it isn't that common a request?And they have a pretty good wine list compared to a lot of the restaurants we visited in Spain.",
