    "Came here for dinner - 1 Canadian, 1 French, 1 American, 1 Icelandic, 4 Finnish members to our party. \u00a0With this diverse array of food tasters we ordered several tapas - Octopus & potato (wow!), shrimps with garlic (wow wow!), patatas bravas (we ordered twice after the two servings disappeared), and the classic tomato bread. \u00a0We then ordered a lobster paella (counts as 2 portions, best anyone at the table had sampled so far on this trip to Barcelona), grilled fish plate, catalan sausage, and veal with roquefort sauce. \u00a0Two bottles of white later - we all tumbled out of the restaurant more than satisfied with the food, the service, and the company.This is a relatively inexpensive restaurant if you know what to order and eat in a family style manner. \u00a0We all sampled all the plates to maximize the experience. \u00a0Then we wandered the streets (walking distance from pretty much everything) to enjoy the La Merc\u00e9 festival.",
