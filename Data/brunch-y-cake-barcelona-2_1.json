    "Ugh, we were really excited to try this place so we braved the brunch crowd on a weekday morning. It was pretty busy but we were seated in less than 10 minutes...The restaurant was cute, service was quick for Spain, and there's an English menu, and some fun stuff on the menu. However, everything was way TOO sweet for my liking. The salmon eggs benedict was almost inedible because they drenched everything in sugar...and the hollandaise sauce was bright lime green. The food was presented on a shovel, and though I appreciate the creativity, it was a like a preschool project gone wrong. My husband I couldn't finish our meal because we hit our sweet \"bliss point\" after a few bites.Great place to people watch but if you want brunch, try Flax and Kale.",
