    "Underwhelming tourist trap. \u00a0Nice exterior and nice decor when you walk in with clear display cases that give you a sense of freshness and cleanliness. \u00a0That's where the positives end. \u00a0Duck on the duck skewers was overdone and greasy; all the salads were greasy with too much mayo and the bread didn't seem fresh. \u00a0Would not recommend.. Unless you're the type that needs to order off of a picture menu and has zero sense of what decent food should taste like. \u00a0Super disappointing, and a waste of perfectly good stomach space in Barcelona. \u00a0Unengaged waitress who didn't seem to enjoy her job much.",
