    "This place is amazeballs. \u00a0I have eaten at many restaurants all round spain including couple Michelin restaurants and Bar Mut is what I still think about and tell others about. \u00a0Whats best about this place is you can do half orders on many of the dishes if you want to try many things. \u00a0I didnt get to try everything, but im sure they are all good here. \u00a0But I must say...The absolute must get is the Carpaccio d'Ou Ferrat and the Braised Octopus. \u00a0I'm not an egg freak and when I do eat egg, its usually the whites and I discard the yolk. \u00a0But this dish is all about the Yolk...Raw. \u00a0I was just Mind Blown by it.The braised octopus is hands down the most tender octopus I have ever had in my Life. \u00a0The fork could rip through the flesh with little to no effort and when it enters your mouth to be chewed, you are practically swallowing it already because you feel like the chewing process is already complete.I also got the Filet Minon with Foie Gras on top, this dish can essentially be found at most bar/cafe in Barcelona so it wasn't anything that stood out to me and could be skipped and tried elsewhere.Just when you think this place is amazing, you get the bill and I was surprised at how cheap it was for the Mind Blown culinary experience I just went through. \u00a0Be grateful you came across this restaurant or heard through word of mouth of this place and go eat here asap!",
