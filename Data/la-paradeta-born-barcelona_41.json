    "Cool place. It is clean, nice on your wallet and the food is fresh! When you enter, you see a varied selection of seafood on ice (just like in a grocery store). You pick what seafood want to eat, pick your sides (salad, bread), add some bevies (you can get a bottle of wine or cava for \u00a37-15), pay, sit down (cool your bevies in those little nifty cooling buckets that are conveniently placed at each table) while you wait for your food cooking and wait for your number to be called. It is a fun experience.The sagrada familia locstion is great. They are open for lunch from 1-4pm (unlike the other locations). Their staff are extremely friendly and their bathrooms are super clean. Bonus: they have highchairs and a separate baby change/people with disability bathroom (just ask for the key).Just minutes from Gaudi's Sagrada Famillia. Great place to grab a bite to eat.",
