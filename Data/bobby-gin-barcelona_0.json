    "Great place and amazing selection on gin. My British friend loved it. Thanks for the birthday shots!!! Loved that you had wifi too. Also I hate Yelp and think Yelp is not trustworthy. Customers make sure to read throughly through reviews on Yelp. I only go online to post my reviews. Find where the wifi is and let people know to be aware of Yelp bad business practices. Loved Bobby Gins for my friends birthday!",
