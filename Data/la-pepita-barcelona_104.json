    "Would not be the only visitor to return for a second night in a row. Consider it a great value for the quality and atmosphere. A happy stumbled-upon at the end of a long walk. Sat at the bar. Our very cute, friendly waiter steered us towards his favorite traditional tapas: tomato toast, homemade mackerel escabeche in a tin (it's fish with pickles (carrot and red onion) over pur\u00e9edveggies (carrot, I think)), marinated sea bass, grilled artichoke with crispy potato and some sort of perfectly smooth creamy artichoke brown stuff, and suuuuper fresh lightly fried calamari. Winner- escabeche.Wine: a light Pinot-esque red (something extravagant like $5 a glass and super delicious)Dessert: traditional Catalan creme..: essentially creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with lots of nutmeg and less vanillaFor atmosphere, a bunch of knick-nacks and graffiti over every inch of wall and window... Including a solid gold gnome flipping the bird. Packed on a Tuesday night with locals and tourists alike.",
