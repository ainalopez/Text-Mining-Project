    "Wow! \u00a0This is the best meal we've had in Barcelona so far. \u00a0We came here on the recommendation of a friend and were quite impressed.We ordered the following and really enjoyed everything:1) mixed salad (a mix of lettuce, tomato, carrots, olives, corn, and tuna) - quite flavorful 2) black noodles - amazing!3) seafood paella - delicious, apparently made in the \"traditional\" style tooWe also shared a bottle of white wine that complemented our meal quite well. It was a white Rioja. The service was good, though they did not check on us mid-meal (however this seems to be a common theme here in BCN).The ambiance is elegant and traditional.Overall, we really liked this place. \u00a0The food is truly outstanding!As a heads up - this place was pretty empty when we arrived at 8:00pm, but started filling up after 9:00pm. \u00a0We'd suggest getting a reservation if you plan on eating after 9:30pm.",
