    "Best tapas I've ever had! Hands down.Brother told me to come here so my two friends and I decided to go here. After reading online that you needed to get here early we heeded their advice. Service opened at 7:30 and got here at 7. Too late. We missed the first round of service and had to wait until the first wave was over. (Stomachs grumbling)After another hour we finally sat down at the bar and were asked what we wanted, any allergies, how much we wanted, and what we wanted to drink. There is no menu and there really are no choices. They brought us out six or seven different dishes with each better than the last. Our favorites were the deep fried anchovies, grilled white fish, and fried artichoke hearts.The owner is a great guy who walks around the bar talking to the customers and taking pictures with everyone. If you ask nicely they even give you a place mat to take home. You obviously get what you pay for and I was glad to fork over what I did. For the three of us, tapas, beers, dessert, it was \u20ac50 each. Like I said I would gladly do it again, I'd just show up earlier.",
