    "Its right off the ramblas. Its small so you could miss it easily. Its next to the St. Josep market so that should help you find it. Obviously we had tapas. We ordered just about everything and it was all very good. Oysters were fresh. The pan con tomate, jamon pata negra and the tenderloin with french fries were very good. We also sample ham and cod croquettes. The scrambled eggs and ham were also very good. The service was good and so was the house wine. We sat in the back alley which wasnt the most picturesque place to sit but it was a cool night so that helped. Overall you cant go wrong and everything was priced well.",
