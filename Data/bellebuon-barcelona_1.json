    "Amazing Italian restaurant. The chef is also the owner and always comes out to check on the guests. The service is great, good wine recommendations. We have been in Barcelona for one week and have been to BelleBuon twice because it's our favorite. Handmade pastas and lasagnas. Everything weve had has been fabulous. My favorite dish had been the rigatoni with speck and tomato and a rocket salad. The burrata was fresh and creamy.",
