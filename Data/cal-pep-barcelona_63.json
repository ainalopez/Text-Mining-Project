    "Patience is key. There is always a line at Cal Pep. I heard of this place from another foodie friend that visited Barcelona, so I decided to check it out. Cal Pep is located in the old gothic area section of the city. \u00a0Narrow streets and stone buildings. Love it.So Cal Pep is known for the chef choosing what you eat. Yes, you can order off the menu, but trust Chef Pep. I did and I was not disappointed. Lots of seafood! Delicious. \u00a0Can't wait to return when I go back to Barcelona.",
