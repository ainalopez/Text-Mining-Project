    "Ended up here after a long day of walking around in the city. We were a bit early, so the kitchen wasn't open yet. But we could order a few cold dishes and some wine. We ordered a plate if cheese, tomato with ham and figs and croquetas. The dishes were excellent so we decides to stay and wait for the kitchen to open so we could try the main courses. We ended up with three different kinds of main courses, salmon (whiskey marinated sashimi-style), cod and veal. I think each and every one of us felt like we just came to food heaven! It was excellent! To finish we ordered white chocolate mousse, and it was the perfect end to a fantastic meal! Staff is very friendly and helpful! Don't get fooled by the minimalistic interior, this is by far the best meal I have had in Spain so far! Price wasn't to bad, we ended up paying about 200 euros for 6 people, with 4 bottles of wine. Main courses are around 15 euros.",
