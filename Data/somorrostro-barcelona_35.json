    "Absolutely love it. This was the best culinary (well, gastronomical, more accurately) experience during our time in Barcelona, a city so renown for stellar food.We saw a little writeup about this place in a Catalan food magazine, and figured it might be a special last night out.Definitely no disappointments here. Opted for the 5 course meal, but looking back, should have opted for the whole 8-9 courses!Among the top contenders, the mussels, freshest I've ever tasted, and the boar \"lasagna\". So, so good. Stellar service to boot, definitely a big step from serio, friendly, good suggestions to boot.Oh, and the wine suggestions, what in the world, how on point, perfectly priced, and oh my goodness, did we drink wine. Best meal we had in Barcelona.Highly, highly recommended. Not to miss while you're in Barcelona. If you live here (in the city, not the restaurant), I envy you!Thanks for listening!",
