    "I went there in July. I had to taste Chinese food in Europe! I am from China living in the states. I thought Chinese food in the U.S. was mediocre but this is really bad.I ordered duck which had a funny taste. I don't think it was fresh at all. The chicken stir fry had big lumps of chicken meat. The only thing good was the fish. I know the restaurant has all the famous people on the wall but sorry the food is terrible. I am scared to try any Chinese restaurants in Europe now.",
