    "Tucked away in a corner behind two massive ornate wooden doors, LilliPep is perfectly cozy. Their selection of old books for sale, mini chess sets, and comfy couches implies that you should stay a while. And they're generous too! The Carajillo, espresso shot with rum, comes with a DOUBLE shot of rum for \u20ac2. The cappuccino is extra foamy, too.They also sell longanisa sandwiches (1/2 or full size), beer and wine, and tapas.With its inexpensive prices, warm cozy atmosphere, great service and free wifi, it's a perfect place to curl up with a coffee and a book.",
