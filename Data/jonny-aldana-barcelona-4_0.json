    "This tapas bar is in any case worth a visit. The staff is very friendly and helpful in explaining some dishes on the menu and they have an English menu. No matter if you sit inside or outside you feel like it's a nice place to have your dinner or lunch. Also I think it's a very good value for money, what you get here. The taste of the dips with the tiny bread to it was very delicious. Additionally I had \"Tosta de Berenjena, sanfaina, queso de cabra, tomates secos y miel\" which was very yummy and made me full in a good way.I would visit Jonny Aldana again anytime!-The food (65%)taste ***** (5)look ***** (5)ripeness ***** (5)price ***** (5)-The location (20%)cleanness ***** (5)ambiance ***** (5)atmosphere ***** (5)-The service (15%)friendliness ***** (5)flexibility **** (4)attention ***** (5)total: ***** (5)",
