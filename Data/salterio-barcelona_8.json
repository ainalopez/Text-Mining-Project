    "The best sangria in Barcelona...no contest! \u00a0And it's organic. \u00a0The place is small and authentically quaint. \u00a0The menu is entirely vegetarian and delicious. \u00a0The sarda four seasons is a 'best ever'..the use of olive oil and sesame seeds is really delicious and I wish I could take this place home with me. \u00a0A great place to lose yourself for a couple of hours in the middle of the afternoon. \u00a0The music is great and totally chill. A true gem!",
