    "This place is awesome. I don't know if we were just starving from walking around being tourists all day or what but this was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. Tacos were good, but the tostadas and the chips & guacamole were excellent. It's a casual & fun bar environment. It's also tiny so push your way in and find a seat. Yes we ate here twice and yes I'd go tomorrow if I was still in Barcelona.",
