    "L'Angolino was a wonderful place to eat breakfast. It's a small, family-run cafe with a small menu. I spent a week in Barcelona and ate breakfast there at least 3 times. The staff was super friendly and accommodating, the food was delicious (as was the coffee) and really well priced. It is mostly a breakfast/brunch restaurant so the one downside is that it closes early.",
