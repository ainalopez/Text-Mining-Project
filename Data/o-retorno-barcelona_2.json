    "My absolute favorite restaurant I went to when I was in Barcelona. We came really early around 5pm, and were seated right away . \u00a0they have a bar style seating in front of the bar, and tons of seating outside, my dad and I got a seat deep inside the restaurant near the kitchen. Fortunely they have English / Spanish mix menus here so we were able to order from that, the people whom work here are very friendly and welcoming. We ordered the razor clams, prawns, patatatas bravas, and the veal with the potatoes and shishito peppers. The prawns and razor clams were my absolute favorite dishes, super fresh and tasty lightly salted and they cooked them just under the point of being cooked all the way so when it reached our table they were soo tender and yummy, oh my god. Only 8-9 euro per dish, even the meat dish which was massive. The meat was really chewy though and more than 50% fat do not much to eat. \u00a0The serving of patatas bravas was insane as well, the next time I come to Barcelona I will make it a point to come eat here but will only order the seafood. The owner also gave us free shots on the house ! It was a great ending to our trip .",
