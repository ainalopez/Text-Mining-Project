    "Pretty unique find in Barcelona amidst all the tapas bars and bakeries. \u00a0Very much of an American/English-speaking restaurant, playing American indie rock music during my whole time there, and they were open early (12:30pm on a Wednesday) for lunch - a rarity in Barcelona. \u00a0They had about a dozen craft beers on tap, with three made in-house. \u00a0I opted to try their Asian dishes: xiao long bao dumplings and a pork-pate banh mi sandwich with fries. \u00a0Both were tasty, but the fries were a bit too salty for my taste, especially when served with the pate in the banh mi.",
