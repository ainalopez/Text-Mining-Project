    "Great place for tapas! No tables you stand at the bar. They bring out trays of different tapas and you grab what you want. They are 2 euros a piece ( can be a bit addictive They count your toothpicks at the end to figure your bill) but are very good. Can be crowded and a little loud but very fun and great food. One of my favorite places.",
