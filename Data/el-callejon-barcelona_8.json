    "So I was going through my pics on the phone and came across these from Barcelona. This was the most delicious place that I ate at in Barcelona hands down. Believe it or not, I had a hard time finding good food. I ate here 3 nights in a row it was so good, I could not get enough! They had the juiciest tastiest estrana cut skirt steak that I've ever had in my life. I was running to this place every night ! No other steak has beat that steak since. Every time I eat a steak, I compare it and bring up this steak in conversation .. Hahaha I still remember it like it was yesterday. Served with chimichurri sauce, the best Papas Bravas with a spicy tomato sauce on top, and a side salad lightly dressed with a vinaigrette . We also ordered a side of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms with parsley Yum! Great Mojitos, awesome Sangria! We did order other small things, I can't remember the names. My friends and I were usually having a blast drinking so.... U know how that goes:-) I just have to say again, Great Food, Awesome Friendly service! Not too many friendly places in Barcelona along with a handful of other European countries. I won't leave them out either.. But u definitely will find awesomeness here! It's a bit tricky to find.. It's in the side streets , don't give up.. Look! It's so worth it.",
