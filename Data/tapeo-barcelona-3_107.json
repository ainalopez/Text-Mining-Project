    "A friend living in Barca took us here and it was fabulous-the best tapas we had and went back on our own for the delicious sangria after visiting the Picasso museum. Tapeo is a bit pricy but they have generous portions. It's a neighborhood with plenty of options to hop from tapas bar to tapas bar.",
