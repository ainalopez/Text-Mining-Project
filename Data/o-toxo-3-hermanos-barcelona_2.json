    "This place was recommended to us while we were visiting. This is off the beaten path a bit, but well worth the walk. The staff was friendly and spoke enough English. Wish I had brushed up on my espanol a little more! We came here for some tapas & sangria for lunch. We had the garlic shrimp, papitas, and l forgot what the last thing was. Everything was delicious. Just wish we would have tried the pallea here. It gets really busy for dinner so reservations are highly recommended.",
