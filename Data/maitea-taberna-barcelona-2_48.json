    "Went on recommendation of our hotel desk. \u00a0Great selection of cold tapas in the case in front of you (all on slices of bread). Highlights were white anchovies with olives, creamy caviar with an anchovy, jamon with Camembert, tuna salad with shredded cheese. \u00a0You can also order hot ones. \u00a0Also fun is that plates of hot tapas come out of the kitchen and the server brings it down the line to tempt you - various eggy things, blood sausage..... You could just sit here and stuff yourself forever. \u00a0All tapas are 1.65 Euro, so great value if you can just stop! \u00a0Great place!",
