    "This is the best place in Barcelona for fresh seafood for sure. I and my husband came at 7.30pm and there were 2-3 couples waiting outside (though the open hour is from 8pm). I thought it would have taken pretty long to prepare the food, but I was wrong. After choosing all types of seafood, we just have to wait 10' and everything is ready. Fresh, hot, and super yummy. I highly recommend the lobster and lemon beer. It's a very good combination.",
