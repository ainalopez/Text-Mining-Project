    "Tucked away close to la ramblas. Arrived around 1:30pm for lunch on a Tuesday. Appeared to be about 50% of capacity. Seated and served promptly. Waitress spoke excellent English and Spanish and provided helpful suggestions. Ordered the virus killer; gingery and delicious! Espresso was good. Lasagna was superb!! Chutney like tomato sauce was spectacular. Stuffed pepper risotto soaked in a green curry were delightful as well. Was eying up the Catalonian cheesecake; wish we had room for desert. Will have to come back sometime for that.",
