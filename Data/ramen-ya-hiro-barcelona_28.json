    "Friendly staff and they now have a menu in English. I've had everything here and for Spain this is the best for the price. Add some kimchi to your ramen for that extra kick of flavor too. Be prepped to wait as they are always packed. I'm originally from LA which is home to some of the best Asian cuisine around. Love my ethnic foods Going again today! Yippee!",
