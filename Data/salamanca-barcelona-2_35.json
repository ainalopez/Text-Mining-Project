    "I've been told that Paella is not local to Barcelona (it is to Valencia) so have not even gone for it. \u00a0What I enjoy is the grilled seafood. \u00a0 Simple to prepare yet wonderful with great quality seafood.There are plenty of great seafood places in Barcelona, even some of the small bars have quality seafood. \u00a0The thing that separates Salamanca is that you can put together a grilled seafood platter of your choice and they will simply weigh the seafood for you. \u00a0What this means is you don't have to go with the ones on their menu, you can create your own. \u00a0I'm not sure how comparable the price is, it isn't cheap that's for sure, but I enjoy getting exactly what I want.",
