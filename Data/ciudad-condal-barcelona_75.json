    "Absolutely fantastic tapas. They have it all: fresh seafood, great meats, excellent veges. Great tapas: calamari, fried green peppers (little Spanish ones), tiny excellent perfectly cooked sirloin, reasonably priced wine. Service is fast (for Barcelona), friendly and helpful. Really crowded at lunch and dinner, lines out the door, but move fast and you can get a glass of wine or a beer while you wait outside for a table.Can't imagine there is better tapas in Barcelona.",
