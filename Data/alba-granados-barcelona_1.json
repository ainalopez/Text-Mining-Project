    "Great location. My starter was a tasty 'salad' of tuna, onion and tomatoes (~\u20ac8). My main was a full order of beef (buey) carpaccio (~\u20ac16). Given the large amount of carpaccio (full-order), the plate was too small. To fit the carpaccio in the plate, there were multiple layers, one on top of each other. That is a NO, NO. Moreover, the carpaccio was not as thin as I like, the meat possibly too young, and there was too much oil over the whole thing. I stopped following a friend's suggestion. Below expectations.",
