    "It's a sort of fusion-tapas place with exotic, mix-and-match ingredients and plate presentation. We tried a few plates : the best was the burrata with tomatoes. The chicken canneloni was pretty good too. The cold coconut and fresh mackerel soup is special because the ingredients don't match and I'm not a fan of raw mackerel. For dessert we tried the truffled tiramisu which is a tiramisu with a white chocolate and truffle sort of crust. It smells like mushrooms so it's quite upsetting while eating a dessert. Some other offerings sounded interesting though.",
