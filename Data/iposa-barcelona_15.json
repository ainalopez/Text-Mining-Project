    "WOWi absolutly love this place. \u00a0Went for dinner late (1045pm) .This restaurant has 4 staff members- a cook, bartender, and 2 servers.The menu changes every night and is all fresh seasonal local ingredients. \u00a0our server was very cool, he was taking shots with us by the end of the night.We ordered 2 tapas- raosted potatoes and an anchovie, sundried tomatoe spread... wow were they good. \u00a0WHYYYYY can their be places like this in New Jersey.For dinner we I ordered salmon with avacado and grapfruit. \u00a0the salmon was actually cured, instead of cooked and was delicious.my girl ordered chicken teriaki (what an american) with rice and was really good too. \u00a0All looked as good as they tasted.Also got a bottle of rose wine and 2 espresso's. \u00a0AND THE BILL WAS ONLY $49!!! for 2 tapas, 2 dinners, a BOTTLE of wine, and 2 coffees. \u00a0 CANT BEAT IT. \u00a0I almost felt bad not paying more for this food. \u00a0my favorite was the anchovie spread, and would suggest it, but their menu is different every night, so dont go their expecting what I ordered. \u00a0PEOPLE.. dont mess this place up with bad reviews and making this place a tourist haven. \u00a0its perfect the way it is. \u00a0lots of locals, each one came in the restaurant and kissed every staff member. \u00a0hah.
