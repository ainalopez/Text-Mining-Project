    "This place was fantastic!! Our waiter was very helpful and suggested one of the best wines of our trip (and reasonably priced). \u00a0Definitely get the salmon suki. \u00a0We loved it so much we got two orders. \u00a0The bread was just ok, I'd skip that. \u00a0The steak tartar with mustard ice cream was really interesting too. \u00a0Great ambiance and a great meal!",
