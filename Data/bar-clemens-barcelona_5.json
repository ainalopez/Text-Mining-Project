    "One of my favorites spots in Barcelona. This tapas bar is at La Boqueria Market and has the fresher and most traditional Spanish food. Their tortillas of different kinds, the grilled fish,...and the coolest short beers (ca\u00f1as) that Alberto, the owner, will be refilling for you with a joke followed by a smile. I can't wait to be there next!",
