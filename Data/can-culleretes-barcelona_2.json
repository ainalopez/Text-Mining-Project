    "A nice chance of pace fromTapas. \u00a0The initial draw to the place was this restaurant has been in operation since the 1700's - they must be doing something right. \u00a0The day of, I was a bit reluctant, having dined at a modern and well executed dining establishment the previous night. \u00a0I was concerned that this place would be the exact opposite, traditional, dated cuisine, and a bit stuff. \u00a0I'm glad I decided to stick with my initial hunch to try this place out. We got to the restaurant 5 minutes before opening, and although we had reservations, there was a long line of people waiting for the restaurant to open - \u00a0a good sign I suppose, otherwise I was in good company with a bunch of patrons misguided to try this place out. I had the seafood special. \u00a0Which was a combo of steamed, fried, and grilled seafood items. \u00a0Generous portions, \u00a0fresh seafood, accompanied with one of the better Sangrias that I had in Barcelona. Had I known that heading to Madrid my seafood options would drastically decline compared to the offerings in Barcelona, I would have even appreciated my meal more at the time.",
