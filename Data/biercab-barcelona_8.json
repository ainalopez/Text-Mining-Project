    "Great beer selection and fantastic tapas. Especially enjoyed the BierCab Bravas. Grilled squid was not at all chewy and well paired with a tasty mashed potato base. Also had the grilled peppers with goat cheese. These may have been my favorite after a week of eating barely any veggies. Service was great with staff speaking multiple languages.",
