    "A little pricier than what I was wanting, but it's certainly got ambiance, style and delicious craft cocktails.I'm bumping this up to a 4 star, but it was really a 3-star experience b/c the price was so off-putting. I think if I wasn't coming from SF where places like this are a dime a dozen, I would've been more impressed. But coming from SF, it felt like I traveled halfway around the world only to walk back into an SF bar. The bar staff were very friendly and attentive, which I can't say for other wait staff in Barcelona I encountered, and the drinks were super good. I got some Pirate drink, and my GF got some chocolate mint drink. The chocolate mint was a bit intense at first, but once it melted, it was special. And I'll be honest, that Pirate drink might be one of my favorite drinks I've ever had. Unfortunately, I spilled it trying to pick it up b/c it was in a slippery mug, which was unfortunate to watch 4 euro's worth of drink splatter all over my girlfriend. The gin drinks were 13-16 euro, and the craft cocktails were 10 euro. Like I said, typical SF prices, but if the exchange rate were different, then those would be astronomical prices. I wouldn't come back b/c this wasn't really what I was looking for, but if someone had never been to San Francisco and wanted this kind of hip, pricy, but intimate spot, I'd recommend it to them.",
