    "I went here with two friends early on a Saturday night. We had been traveling around Spain for a week and decided it was ok to not have tapas or paella for a night so found this Irish pub (on Yelp!) quite close to the hotel for a burger and chips fix. I had a Brew Dog Punk IPA which was on draught and very good. Between the three of us we tried the Flaherty Burger, Roogger's Burger, and a Cottage Pie. All came with chips. All the food was solid pub fare. My favorite parts of the night were a) the IPA (I haven't had a good one lately) and b) the atmosphere. As the other reviews mention, its a sports bar and there was a football game on (Premier League) with fans on both sides. Was a nice night of good beer, good food, along with the cheers and curses of the sports fans. :)",
