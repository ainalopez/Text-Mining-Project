    "Well rated on TripAdviser, Patagonian Beef & Wine is just that. If you don't crave beef, pass on it. Unsurprisingly from the name, it favors Argentine cuisine (although the area of Patagonia does extend to southern Chile). So starters include empanadas, divinely flakey with savory meat fillings and a trio of sauces to try. The Malbec selection is laudable, and you can get a couple of good ones by the glass. The Lomo (beef loin) melts in your mouth. Ambiance is not terribly impressive, but you don't go there to look but to eat. It's not a Texas Steakhouse; it's more sophisticated than that. Gauchos need not apply.",
