    "Let me just start off by saying that Barcelona is one of my favorite cities in Europe. I didn't expect it to be, and it caught me by surprise! Bo de B is not a typical Spanish restaurant as it doesn't serve tapas. I didn't even know they ate sandwiches in Spain! Anyway, this place was amazing! We had the chicken sandwich - with a variety of toppings. Since it's been awhile, I only remember the corn and the cucumber as awesome toppings to the sandwich. The chicken is grilled after you order it and comes in super juicy chunks! The sandwich is topped off with a variety of sauces - my favorite being the spicy sauce. I really wished I had another meal there and I would have gotten the plate! We took the sandwich to go and ate it on the beach. PERFECTION!Best thing is - very affordable! The sandwich can easily be split between two people. I also tried to patatas bravas there. Contrary to what a lot of the other Yelpers said, I didn't think the patatas bravas were that good. They were more like potato wedges, and some of them were uncooked. The sauce was also kind of weird. I would recommend skipping it!",
