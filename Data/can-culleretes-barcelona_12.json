    "I have mixed feelings about this place. Maybe we came on an \"off\" night or our expectations were too high [we heard and read rave reviews] but our dishes were all just a tad above mediocre. The paella was soggy and the rest of our food was rather bland. Nothing truly flavorful or memorable, unfortunately. The service however was stellar.",
