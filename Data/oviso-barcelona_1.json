    "We loved the coffee at Oviso and the food was cheap and pretty decent. I enjoyed my bread with avocado and tomato but the hubby said his eggs were slightly overlooked. But overall a good trendy alternative spot in the middle of the gothic area with great coffee. mylifeinsin.com/2015/03/\u2026 for more info , the menu etc",
