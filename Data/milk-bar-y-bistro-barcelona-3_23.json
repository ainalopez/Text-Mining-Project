    "this place is teeming with life.from the music to the colors inside on the walls, the servers who are loving their lives making food & jamming out.. it's so good.my husband and I stumbled upon this place through Yelp, and we most definitely weren't let down.we split the Popeye's Punch smoothie (spinach, orange, and something else) and then he had the Eggs Benedict- which he loved- while I highly enjoyed the huevos rancheros- SO SO good. we didn't order any drinks but we will most definitely be back to try some cocktails as this awesome restaurant is about a 2 minute's walk from our place.the reviews do not lie: this place is awesome!come if you are looking for a total intriguing experience for all the senses- good atmosphere with interesting + busy (but in a good way) decor, loud & fun music, ridiculously good food, and friendly + passionate servers.also.. they serve brunch EVERY day until 4:30pm aka 16:30.. because.. what's not to love about that?!??!",
