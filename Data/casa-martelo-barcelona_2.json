    "I am giving it three stars because the staff here was friendly and they explained and helped you with what you wanted to eat. \u00a0The options were plenty, the drinks were okay I have had better drinks elsewhere. \u00a0It is a bit pricey for the food so I would look around pick a less trendy yet local joint and save some money for the same food.",
