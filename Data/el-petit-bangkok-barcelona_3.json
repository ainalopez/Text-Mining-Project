    "This place is legit! They have real Thai people here, so you know you can't go wrong. When traveling, my husband and I love eating at Asian restaurants. We were craving good Thai food, and thanks to yelp, we found el petit bangkok. I'd suggest making reservations as we went for lunch and it was quickly packed. They use Thai chilis, so be prepared when you say spicy.Service was great and their bathrooms are nice!",
