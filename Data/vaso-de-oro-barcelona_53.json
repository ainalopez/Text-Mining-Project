    "Really enjoyed the food and beer here. \u00a0We had Pimientos, Bravas, Manchego and the Solomillo. \u00a0If you order the steak (Solomillo), you can ask for it in a bun rather than cut up. \u00a0It's perfectly cooked (medium rare) and so delicious. \u00a0The atmosphere was great, lots of people, very loud, but nice people and good service. \u00a0Enjoy!",
