    "In right at 8 PM without a reservation (but highly recommended...it is a favorite small establishment for tourists and locals alike). \u00a0Went for the Paella and was not disappointed...steamed mussels and chorizo while we waited the 30 mins for the seafood Paella (which was stated right on the menu). \u00a0First bottle of Cava as well (paired nicely!). \u00a0As with the local tempo evening meals are later and restaurants fill up with a vibrant mix of people. \u00a0Stay humble...broken spanglish will get you by with the bi-lingual staff...take your time...don't let things like a wait upset you and you'll be living like a native in no time.",
