    "We arrived with group of nine just before eight, no problem seating us, we were pretty much first in for the evening, a few mins later it was very full. Just wonderful food. Asked waitress to choose for us as this was our first experience of Tapas. We told her what we didn't like, she was excellent. The food amazing, best meal we had in Barcelona. We had drinks and a sweet each and bill came to \u20ac338 inc tips. So not cheap, but it was great food and I believe great value. A meal we will remember for a long time. Really recommend this place.",
