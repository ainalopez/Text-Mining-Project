    "We were in Barcelona last summer and in a new country. \u00a0We did not know where to eat. \u00a0So, yelp, came in handy many times. \u00a0You have to remember, in any european countries most restaurants opens only after 8PM. \u00a0So, brace yourself.In any event, we yelped it and we found Can Lluis. \u00a0We decided to try it base on the positive reviews. \u00a0Well, we were not disappointed.We ate really well and at the end of the evening, we all went back to our hotel satisfied. \u00a0The Riso Negro is definitely to die for.",
