    "Crowded, noisy, and absolutely wonderful. This bustling Barcelonetta business is a staple for locals and tourists alike. The atmosphere alone is worth the trip, but what will keep you here is the 3\u20ac bottles of cava and equally inexpensive tapas. But don't think for a minute that price here is an indication of quality. With some of the best cava in town, they could easily charge 5\u20ac a glass and still keep a full house. Add to this some of the best chorizo and manchego cheese in a 10km radius, and you'll never want to leave.",
