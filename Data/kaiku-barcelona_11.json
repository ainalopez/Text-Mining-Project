    "This is my first time in Barcelona, but I did my research carefully with the help of my fellow Yelpers. \u00a0 Every restaurant has been a hit, setting the bar very high in advance of my Sunday lunch at Kaiku. \u00a0 Sadly, it was a disappointment. \u00a0Service was far from great. \u00a0But that was not an issue for me. \u00a0I speak Spanish and struggled to understand the menu offered in both Spanish and English. \u00a0The English menu was a very poor translation and the waitresses were too rushed to adequately help. \u00a0 In addition, the \u00a0menu was not as special as others had described.. \u00a0The fried anemones were not on the menu. \u00a0The croquettes with foie mouse were well done but nothing new as we have great croquettes elsewhere. \u00a0The mussels were described as steamed without any description as to what type of liquid they were steamed in. \u00a0They sounded so boring we did not order them. \u00a0Someone at a neighboring table ordered the mussels and I never saw anyone dip bread into the sauce. That told me there was not much there in terms of flavor. \u00a0We started with an order of razor clams. \u00a0They appeared to be a a smaller variety than what we have been eating prior. \u00a0Unlike the others they had their parts, feet and siphon muscles protruding from the ends and a dark sack perhaps the stomach was visible in the middle. \u00a0I wondered if this was a function of their being cooked or a sign they were not fresh. \u00a0Visually they were not like those we had been eating for three days prior. Those were creamy white with rounded ends. \u00a0Being recently introduced to razor clams I found this order of clams visually disturbing. In any event, I attempted to eat several but was disappointed. \u00a0They tasted slightly fishy unlike those I'd previously eaten at Ciudad Condal, and Tickets. \u00a0 Neither I or my husband cared for their flavor and could not finish the order. Bottom line, they tasted as bad as they looked. Also, they were the most expensive order of razor clams we've eaten in Barcelona. \u00a0While waiting for our main course to arrive We noticed olives being delivered to a nearby table. \u00a0Had we seen them on the menu we would have ordered them first. \u00a0They were actually delicious, seasoned with paprika. On to the main course.The rice dishes as described on the menu were not particularly exciting. \u00a0That was disappointing as that was my reason for reserving at Kaiku two months in advance. \u00a0We ordered the chef 's special rice dish. \u00a0It is a dish with vegetables, mussels, two pieces of squid, and four small shrimp. \u00a0The first problem was the size of the shrimp. \u00a0They were very small compared to those in chef specials delivered to other tables. \u00a0My boys joked they were not big enough to use as bait. Although they were very sweet and delicious I felt as if we were being taken advantage of because we were obviously tourists. \u00a0The rice itself had little to no flavor. \u00a0It was described as being prepared with fish stock. Well, the chef failed to season the stock. \u00a0The seasoning of a dish is just as important as the freshness of the ingredients. \u00a0 I felt as if the chef at Kaiku depended on flavor of the seafood to speak for itself without any help from him.. \u00a0 The dish was very bland, bordering on flavorless. \u00a0I was underwhelmed to say the least. \u00a0 I never pick up a salt shaker in a restaurant but was forced to do so in order continue eating. \u00a0Bottom line, Kaiku,was a disappointment all around.",
