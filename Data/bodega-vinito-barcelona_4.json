    "Small pinchos and wine bar with great food for not only the price but overall quality. \u00a0I believe the price is one euro per toothpick and we had a party of 4 and had one each of the anchovies and tomato, salmon and avocado, and the ham. \u00a0They quickly bring out more of the pinchos to the table and the place was filled with mainly locals just the way we liked it.For 12 pinchos and 4 wine we spent about 19.50 euro- a steal!",
