    "Usually so happy to have found an Asian restaurant in Barcelona but was quite disappointed in this place. It took the waiter a while to acknowledge me and my two friends and even longer for him to bring the menu over. Service is quite dismal. I ordered the menu temporada, which was an appetizer, entree, drink and dessert. For my stater, I had a pumpkin curry soup. \u00a0Boy it was good. Had a drizzle of light cream and when you mixed the soup in, it marbled marvelously! I then ordered a chicken dish that came with spices in a yogurt sauce and basmati rice. After fifteen minutes of waiting, I was served two chicken breasts and four slices of grilled zucchini. My friend and I (who also ordered this) sat for another five minutes waiting for the rice until we confronted the waiter for it. He came by and told us that they were out of rice and left. It doesn't make sense to me that an Asian restaurant would run out of rice in the afternoon and even worse, the waiter didn't even tell us that/didn't offer alternatives. We called him over again asking for an alternative side and he told us he had gyozas, which we didn't want (chicken with gyoza just doesn't make sense, we wanted a starch). He just left so we had to call the manager, who finally offered us rice noodles. She finally came by again and gave us a plate of noodles to share. Overall my experience was unnecessarily hectic and the service doesn't warrant anything higher than three stars. Not returning again unless I see a different waitstaff because my friend and I just left annoyed and hungry.",
