    "While touristy, this place is worth a visit! \u00a0We came for coffee and snacks and had a decent time. \u00a0The fact that Picasso and his peers frequented this spot was definitely a draw. \u00a0My husband and I had coffees (I had an Americano and he a machiatto) - both were delicious. \u00a0We also has the patatas bravas (delicious!) and cheese plate (decent).The history and old school atmosphere was pleasant.The service wasn't the greatest - the food took a long time to come out, and they forgot the water we ordered.I'd suggest coming here for a cup of coffee (or a beer) and a pastry, and just experiencing first hand one of Picasso's old haunts.",
