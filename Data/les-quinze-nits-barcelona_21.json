    "This place was recommended by our tour guide and glad we took his advice. The food was hot and tasty. It's located in the Placa Reial so the setting is really nice for people watching and the activities of the adjacent La Ramblas. Roasted lamb was excellent. Staff was attentive and kept the food coming in sync. Lunch prices are very reasonable. Don't miss this place if you're in Barcelona.",
