    "Nice cocktails, fabulous atmosphere! A real gem of a bar tucked away in the old town that we were lured into by its warming rosy glow and the smiling happy people inside. We pulled up a couple of stools at the bar and got comfy, whilst eyeing up the surroundings. The shelves across the back wall of the bar are full of large sweetie jars, each one a different flavour rum or vodka, like a boozy pic'n'mix shop. The guy and girl behind the bar are also both total hotties which helped the view! The guy had a friendly chat with us in Spanglish whilst preparing some more tropical themed drinks - I've never seen someone hack into a coconut quite as nonchalantly as him, it was quite special. We spent a very happy hour sipping on caipirinhas (there's a heavy rum bias to the menu) and enjoying the music and fun laidback vibe. Well worth popping in :)",
