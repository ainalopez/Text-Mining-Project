    "An enjoyable tapas restaurant that has an excellent lunch selection and barrels where you can eat outside and people watch. This is tucked away off of La Ramblas and it seems that not many people know about their lunchtime specials. I believe that each \u00a0individual tapas runs one euro, so you can eat quite well even though this is near most of the touristy attractions. The local wine is of course recommended.",
