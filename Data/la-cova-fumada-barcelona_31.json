    "The BEST tapas we had in Barcelona- hands down. \u00a0Hard to find, harder to understand the seating system but if you are persistent and gracious, you will eat the most delicious seafood, artichokes and bombas in Barcelona. \u00a0We ate at many places, this was by far the best. \u00a0Busy as hell- ask for a couple of Estrellas while you wait and enjoy the ride. \u00a0Highlight of our trip.",
