    "Great sandwiches, crispy bread, delicious ham. This place is located inside a shopping center, I followed the directions from my gps on Yelp and took me somewhere else, it's located inside the Centre Comercial Arenas, one level down where all the restaurants are.It's a tiny place, very limited amount of stools, if you're looking for great ham, then this is the place. It's a franchise store but nevertheless, really good stuff. You can either sit there or take it to go, not too expensive.They also sell pieces of cured meat inside these small paper baggies that I guess are like beef jerky snacks, the bread at this place is amazing, but then again, most bread in Barcelona is really good.",
