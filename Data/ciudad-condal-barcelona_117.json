    "Everything we ordered here was terrific, from the olives that were the best we had in Spain to the bacalhau that was better than any we had in Portugal. We managed to snag a spot at the bar, but we would've only had to wait half an hour for a table despite it being so packed it was hard to move around. You can order from the menu, but you might as well just browse the tapas behind the bar and point to the guys to let them know what you want, they'll get it, plate it and send it over to you. Truly a very enjoyable experience here!",
