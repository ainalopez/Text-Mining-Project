    "Thisssss place man...Un-beh-lieeevable! \u00a0Everything i had here was incredible - when it comes to both the service and the food. \u00a0Lets talk about the service first. \u00a0Our waitor was so warm, inviting and friendly. \u00a0He gave wonderful recommendations and really spent the time to explain the food options. \u00a0He even went as far as to print out recommendations for us to experience Flamenco (which we were asking his opinion on). Onto the food....It was extremely difficult to make a decision as everything on the menu sounded so delicious and different, i wanted it all. \u00a0What i went with (seafood heavy) and would highly recommend:-Sea Bass-Octopus-Scallops-Chocolate Hazlenut CookieA test tube bottle of extra virgin olive oil graces the table with a basket of bread and its amazing. \u00a0This was the first time ive experienced EVOO being presented like this. \u00a0Very cute :)",
