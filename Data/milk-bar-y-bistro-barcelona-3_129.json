    "I came to Milk based on the recommendation from the hotel staff. \u00a0I ordered the pancakes which were tasty but swimming in syrup. \u00a0Make sure to ask for the syrup on the side.The atmosphere is reminiscent of a cafe with plenty of pictures on the wall. \u00a0It's cozy yet comfortable. \u00a0Reservations are accepted.Overall it's a fine place for breakfast, but it's not going to win any awards.",
