    "I wouldn't say this is the best place in town, but by all means go here. \u00a0It's right in the center of tourist central, close to La Boqueria. \u00a0This was our first real meal in Barcelona and the picture menu and bar were calling out to my starving tummy. \u00a0Normally I wouldn't choose a place with picture menus, but it turned out to be okay. \u00a0The pork tapas with bacon were better than some of the others on display from what I remember. \u00a0We had others with seafood but they weren't as memorable.We actually ate here twice on our short trip because the food was decent, but more importantly, it's dirt cheap. \u00a0The service isn't great by any means, but the price was so worth it. \u00a0I stuffed my face here. \u00a0To make your visit more worthy, order a Clara - Fanta and beer. \u00a0It's so good you won't regret it.",
