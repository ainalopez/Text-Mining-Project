    "Believe it or not, I got sick of eating pork legs, snails and tapas made out of unintelligible sea creatures on my trip to Catalonia. \u00a0I never thought I would say this, but switching gears and grabbing some Asian fast food was a breath of fresh, and not oniony, air.I hope this chain finds its way deep in the heart of American cites -and deep into the arteries of American hearts- soon. \u00a0It was great. \u00a0You get to pick your type of noodles, protein, sauce, veggies, fixins' etc., and they fry it all up right there in front of you, wrap it in a box and give it to you so you can walk around and eat it with sticks. \u00a0Well, perhaps I'm not articulating this well enough, but trust me, it's good.",
