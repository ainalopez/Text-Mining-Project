    "This is a wonderful place, small portions, delicious. Loved mushrooms, tuna tartar. Did not love ox tail. Desert: raspberries in pudding and chocolate cake were to die for. House Chardonnay was very affordable and had great taste. Disappointed we got charged for bread. Overall, greatly recommended!",
