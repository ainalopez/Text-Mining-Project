    "Definitely be there by 645pm if you want to avoid waiting for a table. While this restaurant is big, the crowds build up quickly and it is not hard to understand why! They have a huge range of daily specials that are priced reasonably. Despite their size, the service is extremely efficient and the servers know the menu very well; we were able to enjoy the daily specials, which presented themselves only in the Spanish language, as our server translated every single dish on the menu for us. Ciudad Condal is also where I had the best (and cheapest) razor clams in Barcelona.",
