    "Excellent little spot for a bite to eat! \u00a0Silly American tourists who show up early will be graciously greeted and invited to sit and enjoy a drink- the kitchen opens at 7:30. \u00a0 Our waitress spoke perfect English, service was excellent and the food was delicious. \u00a0We had pizza with cherry tomatoes and eggplant, pasta fresca with cherry tomatoes in garlic white wine sauce, pasta fresca with truffles in white wine sauce, and the daily special ravioli with truffles. \u00a0For dessert, we had their homemade tiramisu and a delightful sip of lemoncello. \u00a0This is a great place to visit if you've overdosed on tapas for the last six days like we had. \u00a0Great atmosphere, very cozy, definitely recommend!",
