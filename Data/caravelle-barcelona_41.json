    "I very much like Caravelle. \u00a0The food is distinct, if more Anglo-Saxon in style than anything else. \u00a0 \u00a0Indeed, this is perhaps why I go here...When I yearn for a taste of the English-speaking world, I pop into Caravelle. \u00a0The space is clean, minimalist, simple, and bright. \u00a0The staff is cordial, multilingual. \u00a0My only real complaints have to do with the relationship between quality and cost. \u00a0There are some pretty darned excellent restaurants right around here, and if you're looking for a good bite to eat, I would recommend one of Caravelle's neighboring gems. \u00a0That said, this is a quality, if pricey, choice.",
