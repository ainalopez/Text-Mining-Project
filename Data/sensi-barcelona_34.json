    "Again, I visited due to high Yelp reviews and a recommendation of a friend who had visited Barcelona a couple of months ago. It was easy to get to and I enjoyed the quick journey there from Poble Sec. It is very small and crowded, luckily I went on the website beforehand and was aware they due online reservations. I requested a reservation at about 7pm and had one confirmed for 9pm. When we arrived there was a wait. Not for us. We were immediately seated. The waiter spoke english, in fact the majority of people around me spoke English and were clearly visitors like my girlfriend and I. We got to sample a bottle of wine before buying one.Note there is a required minimum of tapas to order if you wish to eat here. We got spicy potatoes brava, Spanish cheese plate with a berry dressing on the side, seared tuna and sataki Iberian pork served cold, cooked medium. And we got unlimited baskets of freshly slice baguettes. However, we checked the menu before and were set on getting tuna tatare, but many of their dishes are seasonal and it was not on the menu, we made up for it though.From and outside perspective I guess you could say this place is a tad on the pricier side and bit tourista, due to the amount of foreigners there. But it was a dainty, beautiful, delicious place with and awesome, friendly, accommodating staff. \u00a0 Four tapas, a bottle of wine and bread for 58 euro, all good. You should check it out.",
