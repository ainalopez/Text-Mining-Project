    "Loved the food - \u20ac8 for the mixture of 4 tacos. There is a range of take away food as well (like guacamole, nachos, brownies) which is handy. The place is a little small, better designed for a take away joint as the name suggests. There are only two main tables available, each seating two. Would def be back, well prices, friendly, and delicious food :)",
