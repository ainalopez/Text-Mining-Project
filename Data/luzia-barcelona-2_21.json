    "Really cool restaurant. 30 minute wait built the anticipation for the food to come. Amazing sangria de cava... You absolutely have to order this. We ordered two fillet steaks but lost in translation resulted in a poor fatty steak, \u00a0sent it back and received a more cooked poor steak. Through further discussion the chef understood the error and provided complimentary small plates and we eventually received an amazing tenderloin. Great bar, \u00a0really worth a visit. If they got it right at the start, \u00a0it may be 5stars!!",
