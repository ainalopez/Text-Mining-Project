    "Our favorite restaurant in Barcelona. The food is very well prepared at reasonable price and in a good location. The staff can be a bit inattentive though perhaps due to the popularity of the restaurant. Get there early to secure a table or book ahead. We always saw a long line waiting for a table outside the restaurant at around 8pm.",
