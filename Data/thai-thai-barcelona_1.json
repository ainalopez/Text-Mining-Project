    "If I could give it a worse star rating I would. Worst Thai food I ever had. I asked for spicy Thai and all I tasted was pepper. The food was bland and the soup wasn't good either. I definitely won't be going back there. At least I know now. I even tried fixing it by adding some coconut milk hoping that it would be edible still didn't work. Very disappointed. After I called to explain what happened I was able to come back to the restaurant and get something different instead. They even gave me my change because it cost less. Great customer service.",
