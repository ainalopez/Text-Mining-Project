    "I don't just like this place because of the fact that it is one block from my flat. I like this place because it has an excellent staff, the atmosphere is warm and relaxing, all of the food is delicious and homemade (my favorite are the dolmas and the feta grill), and their wine is delicious! I suggest if you are visiting near Pla\u00e7a Espanya, and you are hungry or needing a glass of wine (or both), that you walk the two or three blocks from Las Arenas and step in and take your time trying the menu!",
