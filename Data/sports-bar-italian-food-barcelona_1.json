    "Wanted some quality pizza, used Yelp to find this place, and we were very happy with the quality. If you're traveling and looking for a break from the local cuisine, this is a better pizza than most you will find in the states. I recommend the Margherita Pizza with Mozzarella di Bufala. Simple, classic and they get it right.",
