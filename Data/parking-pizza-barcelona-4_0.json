    "This great little pizza place is a modern, chilled out and while recently opened, it is already packed with people. WE quickly understood why. We ordered 1 pizza between the 2 of us, which was enough for a couple. The group next to us ordered 2 between the three. They are not that large, but large enough to share. We also had starter of humus that was served with small cuttings of pizza base. I would also recommend the dessert. We brought our little dog with us and it was allowed to sit under the table. We will be going back.",
