    "If you're a tourist and happen to get a little tired of tapas or seafood, Bacoa has a nice offering of burgers including a solid vegetarian patty and good fries. The concept is well played out in the States, but after a week in Barca, we enjoyed a change of culinary pace with hearty burgers.",
