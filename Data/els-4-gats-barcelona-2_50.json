    "Entering this restaurant, you've the impression to enter a very small location with only some four or five tables. You'll b led through the small room into the main dining hall which is quite huge and nice. They have wonderful lamps on the ceilings and old furniture, a very nice atmosphere. The only thing we didn't like was the very loud playing piano player. Ballade pour Elise wasn't the right music for this place. The food was pretty good, but pretty expensive. I had a quite large leg of some special race of chicken with one of the best sauces I ever had and bread for EUR 15,90! I give 4 points due to the wine: One of our group ordered a small bottle of red wine, tasted it and gave his o.K. After about 5 minutes he realized that the wine was simply not drinkable and told this to the waiter. Reaction: It's your own fault, you did taste it and liked it. No open wines are availablem no glasses of wine. When asking for a glass of white wine, the waiter has been extremely inpolite and unfriendly. I don't like this!",
