    "Fresh, yummy, and well-prepared tapas that were better than most tapas I have had at $3 euro each, but only cost $1 euro.The gazpacho was the best I have ever had, and the sausage with caramelized onion pincho was simply a party in my mouth.Aside from the Sangria which was so-so, you really can't go wrong with this place for a casual lunch or dinner.",
