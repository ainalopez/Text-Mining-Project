    "Okay, I should probably have ordered something Argeninian, but being vegetarian and just wanting to eat something before going to the movies over the street, a glass of wine and a pizza seemed the right thing. I ordered a Pizza Four Cheeses at around 11\u20ac which was absolutely the worst pizza I ever had, and that includes frozen pizzas. Weak dough, over-salted (added to the natural saltiness of the cheeses), too much of those four cheeses. I tried to just eat the crust (which was not really a crust, had more the consistency of heavy, but tasteless bread), I tried the middle, I tried close to the \"crust\". A small slice would have been enough, I managed to eat probably 1/3 of the whole pizza, and that was too much already. I did need a lot of water afterwords to get the taste out of my mouth, and the dough kept being heavy in my stomach throughout the movie. NOT recommended, at least for the choice I made...PS: The guys behind the bar were nice, and the atmosphere good, too, wish I could have said same for the food...",
