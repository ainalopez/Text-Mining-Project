    "Absolutely incredible meal. Maybe one of my finest dining experiences ever. Unpretentious, what you see is what you get. You sit at the bar, they make sure you're not allergic to anything, and then away you go. The barman brings out a selection of the most sumptuous tapas you will ever eat. I had some kind of paella-type noodles smothered with aioli. Heavenly. Followed by a Spanish omelette so gooey and unctuous you could eat it with a spoon. And the piece de resistance: fillet of beef (perfectly pink and juicy) accompanied by thinly sliced potatoes saut\u00e9ed in olive oil and (seemingly) God's tears. Go, go, go. But not in the next few days because I don't want to wait for a seat.",
