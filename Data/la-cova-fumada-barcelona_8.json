    "Word is out about this busy local tapas bar, so you'll see plenty of young tourists in beachwear tucked into the cozy space, but mostly old friends sitting at tables with pitchers of red wine on tap or coffee. The specialty is la bomba, a potato ball with aioli and a hot sauce fuse, and the story goes that anarchists met here when the neighborhood was much rowdier, and they sarcastically offered this to a police officer who asked what they were up to. \"We're making bombs.\" You can also get seafood, and I had excellent razor clams and cod fritters, as well as the fried artichoke they serve in many places. It is recommended that you order in Spanish or in Catalan, but my laughable attempts were met with humor and patience, and the waiter could converse in English.",
