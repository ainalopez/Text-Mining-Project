    "We had a very nice meal at Hisop last week, the one splurge meal of our trip to Barcelona and Valencia. \u00a0It didn't have quite the vibe I was looking for, was hoping for something a little more bustling, but the meal was great. We split an excellent app of grilled squid and blood sausage and entrees of lamb and veal were very tasty. \u00a0They also brought a couple amuse, one was a whitefish and can't remember the other but both were good as was the bread. The chocolate and beer and bread ice cream with foam and whatever else was good too. Service was very polished but friendly and my one knock would be that some of the decor looks a little Ikea-like, with light colored wood that looks kind of cheap. And my friend would complain about still being hungry, said he could have gone for a doner after our meal but I was pleasantly full. With two beers, a port and a white wine it was about 104 euro. \u00a0Good choice.",
