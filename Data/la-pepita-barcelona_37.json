    "Landed here when I was in the area and looked for a place on Yelp. Loved the service. It was very welcoming and hostess/bar tender welcomed us and checked in periodically. \u00a0One of us ordered the meal of the day (soup, salad, pepita sausage sandwich, dessert). The rest of us ordered tapas which I think was the better way to go. Favorites were the burrata salad, pintxos Argentinos (everyone seemed to be ordering them), and jamon. Gambas al Ajillo were just ok. I would absolutely come back.",
