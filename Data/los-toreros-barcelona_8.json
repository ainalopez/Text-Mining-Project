    "We were in Barcelona for only one night, Sunday, and this was one of only a few of the best tapas restaurants open. (Most restaurants of note in Barcelona are closed on Sunday, and/or, Monday.)Didn't have to wait for a table, but, once we were seated, the service team took a while to get going. Once we had all our dishes ordered, cheap vino poured, and when the tapas arrived, all was well. Depending on seasonality/availability, I recommend ordering their excellent razor clams; stuffed peppers were also very good. This is one of those great everyday places, filled with a good mix of tourists and locals alike. Nice vibe.",
