    "This is the first restaurant I happened to find for my first meal in Barcelona. \u00a0I loved this place and no other restaurants I stopped by matched this place. A bottle of wine, 3 sandwiches, and an appetizer all for under \u20ac18. I wasn't really sure how to order since it was just a mob of people who were waiting around the bar but I figured it out. Eating here is a fun experience. \u00a0Don't expect to have a sit down lunch or dinner at this place. The ham sandwich and the burger are amazing.",
