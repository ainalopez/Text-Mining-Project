    "My husband and I found this place here on yelp and seeing it was one of the few places that had 5 stars we just had to give it a try. \u00a0Yelp is much more reliable about how good restaurants are than Tripadvisor! I question if people's taste buds have been burned out when I've been reading great reviews about terrible restaurants on Tripadvisor but nonetheless we had to try this restaurant and it went beyond our expectations. The staff was extremely helpful and attentive and the food was insanely good!! The best part is this place will not break your bank like most places in Barcelona. This place is a must if you want a fantastic meal at a great price with amazing service!!",
