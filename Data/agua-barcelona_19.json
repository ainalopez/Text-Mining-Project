    "Great location and large outdoor seating area. We went here between lunch and dinner so only had the abbreviated tapas menu to choose from. First off, it's pricy here for what you get (13 euros for 4 shrimp?). I think the quality is good but not worth the price. That said, the drinks here are fantastic - we had a pi\u00f1a colada and a mojito that may have been the best of our visit. \u00a0Their regular menu may offer better value but the short tapas fare is not worth it. Come here for a drink and eat elsewhere.",
