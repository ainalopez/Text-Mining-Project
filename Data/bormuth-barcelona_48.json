    "We spent 5 days in Barcelona, and I have to say, the food was not as good as I'd expected. \u00a0I've eaten much better in Madrid and the south of Spain. \u00a0The only really stand-out place we went was this. \u00a0They have an eggplant and honey tapa that was so good, we returned the next night to have it again. \u00a0The vermouth was on tap and fantastic, and they have local microbrew beer, which is something I always look for. \u00a0The service also was wonderful--friendly and attentive. \u00a0There's both outdoor and indoor seating. \u00a0A really nice environment, and great food and drink. \u00a0GO.",
