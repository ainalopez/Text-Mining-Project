    "This is recommended to be a call ahead place (reservations). Drinks: sangria (con vino) was good-a bit sweet, but good. The leeks dish..I wasn't a huge fan. The olive tamponade was too subtle on the leeks & I really tasted only olive oil and leeks..just not what I was imagining. The turbot (special) was very good..clean & light fish that I've never heard of before Barcelona, whereas the mackerel was just a bit..much. The peppers and tomato served on top of the mackerel were very good..actually better than the mackerel. The pork ribs were delicious, per my 2 friends who eat meat. The patatas bravas were really really good and definitely worth ordering. The beef sweet bread was too tender (sounds odd, but that was the comment by both of my meat lovin' friends) & thus made it hard to associate it with actual meat. The butter bread pudding was great! I Definitely recommend that for dessert. Overall, good place worth checking out, not worth waiting over 45 minutes for.",
