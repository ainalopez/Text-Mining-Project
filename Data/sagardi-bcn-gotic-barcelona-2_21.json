    "Pintxos, without the care. This place is good, but thats about it. Not great, not outstanding, not something to write home about. Just another bar that wants to do the average thing.So, to put this in context, i really like pintxos, more places in the world should have them, and the first time i came to barcelona, Sagardi was one of the places that got me on this train. But after a few years, ive been around, tried a few options, and I've realised that this place doesn't care anymore. They have a 'formula recipe' for their tapas, they churn it out, and they don't try too hard.If you are with a bunch of friends, or on the expense account and don't mind paying 2\u20ac per bread slice, then go for it. But if you want something exciting and interesting, look elsewhere.",
