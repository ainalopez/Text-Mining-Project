    "I stopped by La Rita today for an impromptu lunch with a friend when we noticed the sizable line out front. The pretty, green facade has caught my eye several times and we grabbed a table for the prix-fixe lunch and enjoyed our time. It was \u20ac10.30 for three courses, some bread and a drink and you certainly get your money's worth. The food was a little heavy and the service a little erratic but all in all it's a pretty good spot. A convenient, solid choice after some shopping on Passeig de Gracia or a stroll into Gaudi's houses.",
