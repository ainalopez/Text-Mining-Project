    "Tired of the pork heavy choices in Madrid and craving to try some really good patatas bravas I found this place. It was listed as one of the best patats bravas in Barcelona in a TimeOut article so myself and my friend decided to give it a try.It is located close to the park and has a great view of Arc de Triomf, the place itself looks like a charming apartment combined with a coffee place and a bar. It is cozy and inviting and even has a fireplace. We were greeted once we walked in and taken to a table pretty quickly, the service here was better than in other place in Barcelona from the get go.The menu is not very extensive but offers just enough (great) choices. We ended up sharing the patatats bravas of course, the crispy brie salad and the pumpkin ravioli.The pumpkin ravioli was the least impressive item we ordered but crispy brie salad was excellent. As for the main reason why we came to this place, the patats bravas, it was definitely the best patatsas bravas dish I have ever tasted. The creamy aioli was to die for as I could have eaten that on its own.It was sunny outside and we had a table with a street view, it was also our last day in Barcelona and it couldn't have been spent any better",
