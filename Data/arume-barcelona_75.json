    "Found this place on Yelp.Got there at 8:30 and waited about 45 minutes for a table.The scallops were perfect and pork tacos very good. Paella also very good. Blackberry mojito that so many have raved about was just ok for me. My husband loved the desert the best it was vanilla ice cream with flan,sorry do not remember actual menu item.",
