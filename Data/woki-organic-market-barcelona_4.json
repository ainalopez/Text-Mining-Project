    "Amazing little store hidden in the side streets of Gracia that serves as a fun wok casual style restaurant in the front and a small market of organic, gluten free and environmentally friendly fresh foods in the back.They offer a wide range of items that can be found at most health food stores, however the prices were excellent. The environment here was cozy, welcoming, yet exciting. The wok cafe up front has an extensive menu, although I have yet to try anything from here as of yet, I do plan to before leaving the city. Must see place for locals and tourists alike!",
