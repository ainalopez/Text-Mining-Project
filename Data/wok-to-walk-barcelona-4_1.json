    "Depending on your mood lol. \u00a0At the time, it was a 4 star simply that being on the road for almost 2 weeks with no Asian food (on purpose), so really needed this from the motherland--knowing the staff is totally non-Chinese lol. \u00a0But it's better than average at best compared to Vancouver. \u00a0Noodles didn't have the right texture or saucy enough. \u00a0Nice to see it's cooked right in front of you. \u00a0The fried onions were the highlight lolValue is good if not adding all the extras like I did as per pic. \u00a0This is almost $15 Canadian ;( And still cool to eat out of an easy to hold box container lolLocated right at entrance of market so don't sit on the outside like I did, a few panhandlers who didn't have a problem standing right beside you. \u00a0Business-wise, this is a great concept, in & out with lower overhead.",
