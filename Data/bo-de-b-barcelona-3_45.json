    "Another great place for sandwiches in BCN is Bo de B. It's a little further out in the Barri Gotic area, near Milk (which is on Carrer d'en Gignas, or something), but walking the extra mile to its location really does make sense if you think about it, because you'll be ordering big sandwiches loaded with carbs & sauces & feta cheese.The lady serving food took a while to bring us our order (I was #3 or #4 in line when I got there), because there was a bunch of ppl ordering inside, & the queue got longer as I stood there for my \"para llevar\" (to go) order. It seemed the customer base of Bo de B was mostly younger American tourists & locals, including hipsters. The girl that helped me pick espadrilles at La Manual Alpargatera was also there. I was gonna wave hi, but realized we didn't really know each other.So yeah. Yummy sandwiches loaded with fresh veggies, sauces (the nice lady asked what sauce/s & additions I wanted in my veggie & salmon sandwich & I motioned for her to just dump it ALL in there, si us plau!), feta, at really affordable prices (\u20ac3-\u20ac7-ish). Doesn't get better than that, yummmmm :)",
