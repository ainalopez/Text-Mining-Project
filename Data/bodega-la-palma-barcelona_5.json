    "This is one of my go-to watering holes in BCN.I have never had a bad experience and the food and wine are top notch.Other reviews adequately describe the dining area. What I can add is this is a very romantic space with subdued lighting where you can carry on a private conversation even with a full house.As other reviewers have noted there is not a lot of seating here but even if you have to wait for a table it will be well worth it.This is not the cheapest place in BCN \u00a0nor is it overly expensive. Either way at the end of the night you won't care. For me it's a great spot to end whatever spectacular day you have had in this wonderful city.If you want to start or rekindle a romance.....",
