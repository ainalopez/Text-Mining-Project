    "WOW. Literally cannot get enough of this place. I came with 4 friends and our timing was perfect because we rolled up with no reservation, but a table opened up just as we got there. As we were standing in the front while they cleaned the table, they started chatting with us and we got a glass of cava.Besides the amazing staff, THE FOOD.Volcano rice is on another level I can't even begin to explain. It was loaded with seafood, which was awesome, but I couldn't decide if I liked how much seafood there was or if I wanted more rice but there is only a limited amount of space in my stomach and I wanted just 5 servings of it to satisfy myself. Sadly, I didn't make it to desert, but it was just all around amazing.",
