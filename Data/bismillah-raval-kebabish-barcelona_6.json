    "The first place we went to in Barcelona after landing. We were tired from flying and looking for something simple and delicious to eat. We found it. The kind server brought a table from the inside of the restaurant out to the sidewalk so that we could dine al fresco. We each got the meal which includes two empanadas of your choice, a salad, a drink of your choice (wine too!) and a coffee. It was a satisfying and grounding meal for 11.50 euros. The empanadas were delightful - I had the onion and cheese and the chicken a plum. My boyfriend had the chorizo and said that one was the best. Happy travels y'all!",
