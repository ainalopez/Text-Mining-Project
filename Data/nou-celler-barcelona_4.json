    "While the atmosphere of this tapas bar was charming, the food itself scores very low marks. The grilled calamari was chewy/drenched in butter, the mussels were noticeably covered in bits of sand, the prawn was greasy, and the tortilla de potato was lukewarm and far too salty. I left regretting every single bite of food.Highly recommend choosing another restaurant while visiting this area of Barcelona.",
