    "This bar was a really fun place to visit before going clubbing at Razz. \u00a0Its enormous and has a fair price for drinks. \u00a0I would say that its packed based on the night, so it could be pretty hit or miss. \u00a0One nice thing is that it serves tapas as well, so you can get drunk munchies before you go out, often running up the bill.",
