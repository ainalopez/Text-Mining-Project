    "I do not give a lot of 5 stars rating just because I feel as if it has to completely blow my mind, AMAZINGLY good for me to rate a 5. This place, by far, is the BEST tapas bar that I have been to in Barcelona yet. My husband and I love to try new things and different types of food. There was not a tapas \u00a0dish here that was unsatisfactory to us. We ordered:2 beers2 cavasDuck Timbale (shredded duck topped with parmesan cheese) awesome!Potatas Bravas (Potatoes with spicy sauce) very goodSeafood Paella (Mussels, Prawn, Squid on top of rice) soooo good!Tuna Tartare \u00a0served with a very light wasabi sauce and toasted crispy bread (my favorite!)Normandy Casserole (Potatoes with parmesan cheese on top)For dessert we had the Creme Catalana! (Their HOMEMADE Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e) absolutely great and very flavorful!It is a very small restaurant so reservations are recommended! The environment is entertaining and the staff was very friendly. They speak English very well as well as Spanish and French as the owners are French.Our bill came out to be 64 euros and it was worth every bit of it! We are coming back for New Years Eve dinner again!",
