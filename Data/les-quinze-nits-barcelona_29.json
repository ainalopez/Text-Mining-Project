    "Recommended by host at the hotel we were staying at. First night in Barcelona and we had a good time. People watching, sangria, paella, bread with tomato spread and jamon, seafood bisque, and for dessert we had nouggit ice cream creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e on top with chocolate syrup and a birthday candel on top. Have to say that your waiter makes all the difference. Our first waiter either was tired or was at the end of her shift. Our second waiter Mark was wonderful.",
