    "Lizarran was next door to my hotel (Doubletree) when I was staying in Barcelona, and they served Pinxos, which were quite tasty. They do have a happy hour where the pinxos have a special price. Good place to go if you are hungry and just want a bite- especially when you are traveling from the US and you aren't used to the late times that the Spanish eat lunch and dinner - that is quite an adjustment. Would definitely recommend for a quick bite.",
