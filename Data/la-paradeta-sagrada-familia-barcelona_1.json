    "This place is a must-go for seafood lovers (aka my mother). It's essentially a fish market that cooks for you right away; you get to pick what you want and tell the kitchen how to make it (grilled, fried, steamed, etc.). Everything is super fresh.My family actually went twice during our week in Barcelona - that's how awesome this place is.Oysters (Raw) - My dad was a huge fan of this. Each oyster is quite big and worth the price.Mussels (Steamed) - They were cooked to perfection the first time we went, and slightly overcooked the second time we went. But otherwise, very fresh and flavorful.Tuna (Grilled) - Seared on both sides, super raw and juicy in the middle. The slices are very big, so make sure you have a large party for this.Monkfish (Grilled) - It definitely has more flavor than most white fish that I've had.Monkfish Soup - Most fishy soup I've had in a while, and it was absolutely delicious.Squid (Grilled) - This was my favorite. Very tender and flavorful.Razor Clams (Steamed) - These were only okay. These are sold by the bunch (rather than by weight), and there weren't that many per bundle. This is probably due to the fact that it probably wasn't in season in January.After you pick all your seafood, you order your drinks and pay at the counter. Then you get to pick your own table, and the kitchen will call your table number over to pick up each dish as it's done.Going to La Paradeta is a very unique experience that is definitely worth every minute and Euro you spend there.",
