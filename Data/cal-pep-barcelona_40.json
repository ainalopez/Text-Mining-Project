    "My husband & I saved Cal Pep as our last honeymoon meal in Spain as we had heard so many good things. \u00a0Unfortunately, we couldn't have been more disappointed. \u00a0We are from Chicago & know what good food is, & had experienced incredible tapas all week long. The food here wasn't bad, but is was nothing special. \u00a0What was awful about this place was the service. \u00a0WARNING, if you are a tourist & do not speak Catal\u00e1n, don't go here. \u00a0They will treat you differently by paying little attention to you & give you mostly fried food despite asking for other things. \u00a0Look around you... all the tourist will be served the same thing. \u00a0I wish we would have spent our $117 somewhere else as this was completely not worth it or the wait in line.",
