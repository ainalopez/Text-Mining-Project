    "This place is nice, right on shore and it is an elegant restaurant. It is really crowded during the lunch time, you can wait a while to get a table. It is quite overpriced, i am not sure how touristy this place is but what I saw was that it was mixed with local and tourists. You should try their profiterole it is extremely delicious.",
