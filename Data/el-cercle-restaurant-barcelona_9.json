    "I would have given this place 0 stars if that were an option - solely due to the food because the atmosphere/ambiance was great. My boyfriend and I are from the NYC area and wanted to have lunch outside in the gotic court while visiting Barcelona. We both ordered the chicken noodle dish on the Japanese menu and it was the worst dish either of us had ever had. It seems from reading the other reviews that the Mediterranean menu is the way to go.",
