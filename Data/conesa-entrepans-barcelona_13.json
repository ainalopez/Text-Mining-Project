    "This place is a great option for a quicker lunch in Barcelona..anyone who does a menu del dia daily is sure to pop soon. You can order nearly any sandwich with any ingredients but ordering can be very intimidating for someone not fluent or confident, so be prepared and keep it simple. \u00a0Also, plan to go out of normal lunching hours to avoid lines around the plaza. \u00a0Its crowded inside and people get pushy. \u00a0Walk with your food if you can.",
