    "This tapas place is just off the busy Las Rambalas in a quiet street. \u00a0The amount of lovely looking tapas lined the counters. \u00a0We had a very good glass of house white wine at 4 euros with 5 tapas. \u00a0We had the salmon with tuna tapa which was very fresh and the olives with anchovies has a right combination of saltiness. \u00a0The cure ham on a mini baguette was only okay as you tasted more of the bread than the ham. \u00a0The best one one was hands down a dessert-like tapa with cream and magenta raspberry sauce on top. \u00a0It tasted like a great ice cream! \u00a0Every tapa was 1.95 euro and olive one was only 1 euro. They tallied up by the toothpicks. \u00a0A great place for tasty and reasonable tapas amongst a tourist area!",
