    "We stopped in for a late lunch after an afternoon of sight seeing. The way this place works is that you order your drink and then serve yourself some cold tapas from the front area. The waitress will ring a bell as she walks out some hot tapas from the kitchen. They keep track of the number of toothpicks (and their size) to determine how many tapas you ate and what your bill will come out to.I started off with a decently sized glass of Mahou (for only 1,90 euros!) and some cold tapas. We also had some of the hot tapas, including a breaded chicken tapa with barbecue sauce on it. The food was pretty good and cheap. For two people eating a total of about 10 tapas and two drinks, the bill came out to less than 20 euros. What a very good deal!If you want decent food and a cheap lunch, this is a great spot.",
