    "If you are sick of tapas, or you are just in the mood for some good Italian food in Barcelona, this is the place to go. \u00a0There are so many options for pasta dishes, you can choose the type of pasta you want with the type of sauce you want, and let me tell you...there are so many options!!! There are at least over 10 options for each, I suggest the gnocchi with the mushroom sauce or pesto sauce. \u00a0If you don't want pasta, choose from their menu filled with different types of pizzas, and the salads are superb! I got one which had a huge chunk of fried goat cheese on it with sugar glazed tomatoes. I destroyed the desserts each time I was there, even though I was so full. \u00a0All of the desserts are good, and you get to choose the types of ice cream that you want with them.Go here if you are...1. hungry2. like pizza and pasta",
