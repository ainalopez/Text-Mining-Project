    "After being curious about Granja for quite a while I finally made it through the door. The Halle smoothie was pleasing as it was made from fresh fruit. The plate I ordered was good (standard eggs with toast), however, it was served on an oversized plate, which made it seem that there should have been some garnish to compensate for all the empty space. On the downside, the service is exceptionally slow and highly inattentive. Be aware that if you pay this establishment a visit give yourself a generous time slot. Wish this place would get wifi and step up the service, the atmosphere is quaint and welcoming, and there's so much potential... but the service is a big letdown!Would have given this place 4 stars but the horrid service makes me knock off 2.",
