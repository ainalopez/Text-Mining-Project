    "Underwhelming. It's been 2 years since I've had dinner here and to be honest, I can't remember what I had. This dinner did not stand out in any way. When I enjoy a meal, I think back on it and remember the flavors and the enjoyment I had while eating the dishes. Unfortunately, I do not remember a single dish from this restaurant. This was probably one of the more expensive 1 Michelin star restaurant that I have been to and just not worth it. I would skip this place and pick another.",
