    "loved this place. great beer. nice service - i was shocked that anyone else wrote service was poor. the two girls working were very attentive to our beer/wine needs and the food came out very fast. awesome vegan/ veggie options in barcelona. this was the second place i tried from this owner; mosquito is still my favorite but this place was awesome.",
