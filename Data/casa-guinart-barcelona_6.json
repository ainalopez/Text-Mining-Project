    "I really couldn't say much bad about Cassa Guinart. \u00a0We stopped in here because we didn't get our fill at the market. \u00a0The wine was good and each tapa had it's own unique taste. \u00a0Some of the highlights were the thinly sliced artichoke hearts and the wild mushrooms. \u00a0The staff was also very helpful even in English and did everything with a smile. \u00a0Even though it was a little pricy, it was in the tourist area so you have to expect that.",
