    "Love this place. As a solo traveller, some places you go it just doesn't feel right, the staff ignore you or you feel like everyone looks at you weird. Not here. They have a shared bar table at the front of the restaurant, but if you're wanting to snag a spot there, get there early. I mean Spain early, so about 8. I had the same waiter twice and he was a gem. Though everyone who served me spoke excellent English, this guy switched from English to French and back to Spanish with no problems. So friendly and have excellent recommendations, the aubergine with honey was great, as was the duck confit which has an orange sauce as well as a bonus cranberry or plum sauce. The risotto was amazing.Basically if you're in the area I highly recommend this place. Great food, a quirky yet unpretentious menu and wonderful service. I'm a little bit in love.",
