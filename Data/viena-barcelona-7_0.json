    "This nice little sandwich place very near La Boqueria is a gem. A friendly and tranquil respite from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla just outside its front door. Classical music plays in the background as you are nourished.The NY Times really isn't overblowing its designation of their Iberico de gla as \"the world's greatest sandwich\"...for it is right up there. Any good sandwich must stand on its bread and this crusty, narrow \"flauta\" (a thin baguette) stands its ground with any other. The jamon Iberico is a meat unlike anything you come across in the states. ...An earthy pork taste that's otherworldly.The only dressing for the sandwich is the tomato spread. As with the standard European approach (read vs. U.S.) the goal is excellence of ingredients...not weight.Fantastico.I'm certain their other offerings are just fine too.",
