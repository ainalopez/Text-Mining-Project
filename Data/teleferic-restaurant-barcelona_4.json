    "I came to this tapas place because it was recommended by my Airbnb host, who mentioned that Mark Zuckerberg had recently been there (not sure if that's a good thing or not, though!).I sat at the bar and was greeted promptly by a friendly server who went ahead and explained how ordering food worked. But first I asked for a refreshing ca\u00f1a.The food system is basically buffet style, where a wide variety of tapas are set on the bar and you pick them up, and each one comes with a specific \"pin\" on it. The pin represents the price of the tapa and you're charged on the number and type of pins you have at the end of your meal (kind of like one of those boat sushi restaurants).I had a few delicacies, like crab salad and a couple of foie gras tapas. Xavi, the manager, recommended ordering the octopus from their a la carte menu and that was definitely the highlight of my meal. He was super friendly and recommended a few night spots to visit after. I'd come back just to try more of the tapas they have to offer, tech magnate present or not.",
