    "First food stop in Barcelona and not disappointed at all with the food. The Banana Bread topped with Fried Banana and their version of scrambled egg both were delicious. Freshly squeezed OG to top it off and a really chill atmosphere with great vibes and music made for an awesome meal. Check out my website VeggEasy.com",
