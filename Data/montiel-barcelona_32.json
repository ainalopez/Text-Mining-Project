    "We have just been here for our wedding anniversary. The gastronomic tasting menu is fantastic, the chef is brilliant and able to come up with creative tasty dishes with the most interesting ingredients. We have been to some of the best Michelin restaurants and tasted some great cuisine but the food here is really good.",
