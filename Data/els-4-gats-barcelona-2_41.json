    "I wondered past this place, and heard it about from several people. \u00a0Perhaps it was the time of day I went or it was an off day, but I was far from impressed. \u00a0The food was extremely overpriced for what you received (tomato bread, 5 small sliced of cheese and a watch for 24,00 euro.The waitstaff appeared to care less about anyone, including me. They appeared uninterested and as if I was a bother (even though I say alone in a corner.) \u00a0I took notice that they treated everyone that way.Barcelona has so many other amazing places to eat, I highly recommend you save your money and go elsewhere.",
