    "Found this place while staying in the Gothic area of Barcelona. Nice decor, and wait staff very friendly. The clientele are, like us, tourists. \u00a0Food is solid western types with a very British/American influence. \u00a0If your feeling like a home style breakfast while away, this is for you. \u00a0If your looking for locally influenced types of food, there are other caf\u00e9s in the area.This is your place if your feeling a bit homesick.",
