    "OMG THIS PLACE. Heaven for foodies. Seriously. I almost don't want to write about this treasure and keep it for myself. Not just that you can buy some goods (we had to buy the delicious bread with nuts and dry fruit in it) you also get one of the best Sangria in town. We stopped by around 5pm and didn't mean to get such a buzz. But the Sangrias are just too good and huge. This is just what has to happen in Barcelona. Very good food. It was a party in my mouth.
