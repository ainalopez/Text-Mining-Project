    "We saw this place as we were walking into Parc Guel. \u00a0They had some signs up for picnic specials, so we popped in. \u00a0They have good selection of sandwiches to take out or eat in. \u00a0We grabbed a couple sandwiches and sodas (oh how I miss lemon Fanta!) and head into the park.They are good, solid sandwiches. \u00a0They are nothing special; meat and cheese, but they hit the spot and they were reasonably priced.The owner was serving us. \u00a0He talked us up a bit and was very friendly.",
