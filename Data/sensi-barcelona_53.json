    "This was my best meal while on vacation in Europe. The food was so good. About 5 tapas is enough for 2 people for dinner. Everyone we ordered was exceptional. \u00a0Sangria is good and strong. \u00a0Service is excellent. all the waiters and waitresses really work hard to give you an exceptional experience. \u00a0We were lucky and got seats at the bar with no reservations but I would recommend calling ahead of time as many people after us got turned away. \u00a0There menu is in English also.",
