    "my friend recommended this place before i went to spain, but i was skeptical, since they had asian/fusion tapas. \u00a0wtf? \u00a0why would i want to eat asian food in barcelona? \u00a0well, i ended up stumbling upon it on my last night, and it was a welcome respite from all the jamon i had been eating up to that point. \u00a0my friend and i tried the tuna tartare, grilled gambas w/ stir fried noodles, artichokes w/ romesco, and the duck timbale. \u00a0washed down w/ 2 glasses of red, and i was good to go. \u00a0they were a bit heavy-handed w/ the soy sauce, but i was craving some of that soy after not having any in over a week.",
