    "omg omg OMG!!! This restaurant is the best, I have a plant based diet and they helped me get a full satisfied belly tonight! The Kafe, the vegetable lasagna and the brownie are to die for! The best of this restaurant is the staff. Lucas was very personable and helpful as he guided us through the menu. He also gave us breakfast recommendations for tomorrow. Check this place out, you will not be disappointed! PS the prices are amazing, great deal for the price!",
