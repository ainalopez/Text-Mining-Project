    "From our gracious server Aurora to our dessert and coffee everything was more than just satisfying! We had the mussels marinera a wonderful melt-in-your-mouth texture! We all scooped up the delicious tomato-based sauce with the warm, crusty bread served to us, yummy!!! The paella fideua was fantastic, al dente and oh so flavorful! We also had the paella parillada which was highly recommended and did not disappoint! The grilled seafood platter (hake, cod, squid, prawns, lobster tail, etc.) had a generous portion fit for 3-4pax depending on how hungry you are but def was a party in our mouths and taste buds that nothing was left! Overall our party of six left fully satisfied and will def return for another lovely meal before we leave Barcelona! Unforgettable and highly recommended!!!",
