    "One of my favorite places to go brunching in Barcelona, especially in the summer. Located in front of the beach, with very very friendly and dynamic staff, it has really good music and a very diverse menu. The presentation of the food and beverages is very original, you just have to look at the pictures, and the taste is even better!! You don't feel pressure to be in a rush, and it's the perfect place to eat before/after taking a walk by the beach. My favs: The salmon bagel, the a\u00e7ai bowl and the burger! The healthy juices and smoothies are also delicious!",
