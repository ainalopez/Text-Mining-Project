    "This place can't be overhyped. \u00a0One of the single best meals of my life.Highlights:-Cherries served hanging on a miniature TREE, covered in foam. \u00a0Accompanied by acorns made from who-knows-what-but-it-was-amazing.-Cavier wrapped in Toro, basted with ham fat. \u00a0Melt in your mouth amazing.-Air puffed pastry filled with Manchego cheese foam, topped with Cavier, Parmesan, and spice. \u00a0We got 2 of these.-Pork Belly mini ciabatta sandwich. \u00a0The most tender, melt in your mouth sandwich.-Tuna Cones. \u00a0Incredible. \u00a0Don't miss. \u00a0Rivals my favorite sushi joint.-I don't usually eat Olives, but these extremely pickled olives were an experience so crazy, the entire table sat back in their chairs and their eyes bugged out. \u00a0They evaporate in your mouth, and the flavor is fantastic-I don't know what it was called, but we ordered this salmon egg tapa on top of a marshmallow like cylinder with a foam squishy texture. \u00a0It was very unique and delicious.-The cheesecake was so fresh and soft, it reminded me of a gourmet Brie. \u00a0-The strawberry salad for dessert tasted like nature incarnate. \u00a0The whole table could have ordered this all day. \u00a0Dried, pickled, fresh strawberries mixed in a bowl over Basil Sorbet.I should also mention the atmosphere, service, and decor were perfect. \u00a0This will be my first stop every time I visit Barcelona.They recommend reservations, weeks in advance, but I was able to walk in on a Saturday afternoon and book a reservation for 4 to come back in an hour.",
