    "When I saw the 'Kiosko' name for the first time I immediately thought about magazines for some reason. What you can get here are actually pretty good hamburgers. It's a very popular place under the locals. With a bit of luck you can yourself a spot inside. There is quite a range hamburgers you can choose from. I went a got myself a Japonesa burger. It's a burger served together with Teriyaki sauce and a sesame seed burger bread if I'm correct. I didn't know the burger was well done. I actually like medium cooked burgers better, but still it was tasty. The only thing that wasn't really doing it for me was the Teriyaki sauce. My girl liked the sauce better. She also likes medium cooked burgers more. Her Manchego burger, which I also tried, was tastier and medium cooked. I think it's better if the place indicates or asks how the burgers are cooked (medium or well done). So overall maybe not a perfect, but quite a good burgerplace if you ask me. Prices are between 5-10 Euro's so doesn't hurt your wallet.",
