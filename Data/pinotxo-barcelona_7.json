    "Honestly one of the best lunches O have had in my life. Located in the very busy Boqueria market.. it was tough to get a seat. Once we managed to get three seats (which are facing the kitchen) we were greeted by Pinotxo iconic owner. He asked... fish or meat?... We said fish... and so 3 fish tapas came. All I can say is wow... the squid was incredible, so were the crawfish. A must go.",
