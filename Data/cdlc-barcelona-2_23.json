    "CDLC is once of the nicest beach bar in Barcelona! It's a bar so they close at 3:00 am!!! And it's a restaurant at the same time... I never had dinner there, but I heard it's not that good!!! Thought the lounge itself is amazing! Great setting and great music!!! You should go there in summer for sure!!! It's a bit empty during the week, so go there during weekends!!!",
