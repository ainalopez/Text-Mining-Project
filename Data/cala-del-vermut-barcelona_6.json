    "This was our very first stop while taking the \"The Barcelona Taste\" tapas tour. Never trying Sweet Vermut (vermouth) before, I was quite reluctant to try it knowing how Dry Vermouth taste. Our trusted tapas tour guide, Joe insisted it tasted nothing like Dry Vermouth. So first sip, Bam! Excellent! We love Sweet Vermut! Cala del Vermut makes their own Sweet Vermut and has it on tap. It's a very tiny, family operated restaurant that seats about eight. The tapas dishes we tried here were good, but the real winner was definitely the Sweet Vermut. I highly recommend it.",
