    "WOW! How to satisfy a hungry Chinese family looking for something regional and (hopefully) authentic. Staff at the Familia Sagrada suggested this short walk to this seafood resistant. There was a wait but that was already confirmation there was something good happening inside.Once we got a glimpse of the seafood counter we were hooked. We ordered the fish soup and a selection of fish and shell fish. Definitely a good place. No frills but the staff speak English which made things easy.",
