    "The epitome of a bad tourist restaurant. \u00a0The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that if all you want to do is have a glass of wine and watch folks in the plaza this is probably about as good as you can get. \u00a0On the other hand if you want to eat, the food is barely edible. \u00a0My wife's tuna could not be eaten and tasted like it had gone bad at least a day earlier. \u00a0To my chagrin two days later a cab driver recommended I not eat anywhere near las Ramblas, which I do not agree. \u00a0Any other randomly selected restaurant would have to have better food than this place.",
