    "This was the first tapas place my friends and I went to while in Barcelona. \u00a0I have to admit, given the price and quality, it was my favorite tapas experience. First off, it was one of the few restaurants/cafes/bars that were open on the national holiday (Assumption of Mary). \u00a0We yelped whatever was near us and landed upon this place.The staff was extremely accommodating and very patient as we struggled with the menu. \u00a0The waiter took his time to answer all of our questions despite our limited Spanish. \u00a0In the end, we asked him to pick his favorite 6-8 dishes and he certainly picked the best ones!The food was absolutely amazing. \u00a0Unfortunately I don't remember the exact names, but two dishes do stand out in my mind:1) The mushroom dish was definitely my favorite. \u00a0It was seasoned perfectly.2) The calamari dish was another favorite of ours. \u00a0We devoured it.The clara that I had here was also very nice -- my friends ordered local beers and they really enjoyed them as well.If I'm ever back in Barcelona, I would definitely come here again. \u00a0This is not a fancy restaurant -- it's very small and we ended up sitting outside because there was no room indoors. \u00a0It's a very nice low-key place to just sit, eat, drink and talk!",
