    "after all the jamon and tapas, pakta was a welcome respite. \u00a0i LOVED this restaurant, right down to the decor, presentation, service, the drinks and of course, the food! \u00a0my friend and i came, and we opted for the smaller fujiyama menu, which was plenty of food. \u00a0even tho there was a lot of food, i didn't feel gross after finishing every bite. \u00a0my faves were the honzen ryori and the causas, but everything was fabulous. \u00a0i would definitely come back.",
