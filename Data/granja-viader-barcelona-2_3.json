    "A classic. If anything is a classic in Barcelona, this place is.Although their signature item is the hot chocolate, they sell xurros, and teas, and coffees, along with pastries and other assorted sweet (and even some savory) treats.I love the hot chocolate here. So delicious. Great flavor, and you can always ask for more milk if it's too much for you.Staff is nice too, a little overworked because of all the people.Be ready for a big line, although not a long wait, especially if you're looking to go on a Friday or Saturday night. Get ready also for a fair amount of noise.Great place for a date, with a totally romantic, although not very private because of all the people.Beauty.",
