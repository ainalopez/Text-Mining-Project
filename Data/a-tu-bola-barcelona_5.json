    "One word: amazeballs! Charming little hole-in-the-wall. Pick from 7 types of balls - beef, pork, chicken, Asian chicken, shrimp, chickpea, or sweet potato - in one of 3 styles - tapa (1 ball), pita (2), or plate (3). You cannot mix and match within a single style; so, two of us ordered three pitas to try different flavors. Pork was my favorite - would have loved it with the chicken preparation which included grilled pineapple. Still, every bite was just as delicious as the next. We didn't eat all of the pita, but it was so fluffy, perfect for soaking up a tangy green sauce. For dessert, rich, dark chocolate truffle balls! We were among a few others there at closing who lucked out when the chef pulled out his house made limoncello and shared a round with us all. Can't wait to go back and try the rest!",
