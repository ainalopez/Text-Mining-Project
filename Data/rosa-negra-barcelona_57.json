    "This is a very cool place in Laietana (the street between Born and Gotic).They serve traditional mexican food (not California Tacos as I see many of you miss).They have very cheap set menus before 4pm. You pay 9 euros for a starter, main and a dessert or coffee, included one drink.From 7pm this restaurants becomes crowded, with both people who eat and people who are there to have drinks. They serve frozen margaritas and mojito for 3.5 euros.The taco is very good and very spicy. Also went for the nachos with cheese and guacamole for a starter. Very good and tasty. Little bit dissapointed on the burritos.The staff is nice, and you will never wait long for your next dish or drink.This is also a cool place to go for some drinks before you head clubbing.",
