    "Great service, A-MAZING tapas, and a fantastic wine sommelier. Over the few times we came we always saw lots of hugging and cheek-kissing between patrons and staff. The servers KNOW their customers which only means this is a great place.First stop, just for wine after a late night out. It was packed, but the server found us a small spot at the bar. A very funny, high-spirited Italian lady (who we later found out was the wine sommelier) asked us what we liked. The boyfriend & I are a bit snob-ish about wine, but with just a few descriptors she produced 2 absolutely *perfect* wines for both of us.Second stop, we brought our chef friend for dinner. Again, the place was packed and we were initially told to wait. But very quickly a server found a few places for us at the bar. There the bartender(?) gave us fantastic personal service and brought out some of the best tapas we had in our 2 week trip. The fatty tuna was mind-blowing and the razor clams were only beat by Cal Pep. We also had great wine (again from the resident sommelier) and got a fantastic recommendation for a paella place on the beach.Third stop, dinner on our last night. As always, the place was packed, but magically the servers were able to get us a table. We ordered a few different tapas that were equally as good and again, another wine that was perfect.The energy is great here. The tapas are even better and the wine is fantastic. Make this a stop on your stay in Barcelona.",
