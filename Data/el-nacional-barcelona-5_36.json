    "The 5 stars is for the ambiance and atmosphere. \u00a0The food was more 3 and 4 star, but the restaurants are a sizzle for your senses. \u00a0One of the most beautiful, energetic restaurant courts I have ever experienced. \u00a0You'll find most anything to delight your taste buds from small tapas plates to share among friends, to lively wine and cocktail bars. \u00a0There is one particular bar in the center that professionals carve the most marvelous artisan meats and cheeses while you watch, and enjoy their craft. \u00a0Another spot in the court is a Brasserie, and a seafood restaurant. \u00a0Make an evening of it, and enjoy several. \u00a0The wait is never terribly long, and the atmosphere is just magical.",
