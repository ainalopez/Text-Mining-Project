    "I think this was our first \"dinner\" in Spain. I say \"dinner\" cause it was at around 5pm...way earlier than dinner should be had.Started it off with some sangria - which would be a constant theme in Barcelona. It was delicious. We shared a full pitcher - and was enough to fill our cups twice each.Patatas bravas - two sauces over fresh fried potato chunks....amazing.Croquetas - these ham filled beauties were so good. I had two and kind of wish I had more.Bomba \u00a0- back home I call this a papa rellena. Mashed potatoes engulfing ground beef, rolled into a ball and fried. Really good.Spare ribs (costillas) - these were my favorite bite! While everything I mentioned is good to get....these are MUST GET. They had like a honey glaze on them and fell off the bone! Since you can eat them with a fork, I didn't lick my fingers...but I would've if I had to. Believe that.The wife had some fried eggplant (with honey). They were delicious and disgusting. I know...trust me, I was even more confused than you are reading this. They tasted like eggplant - but the consistency was like PORK BELLY....thus it made my THINK it was pork belly, without the flavor...I was all sorts of lost - so I just took another bite of my ribs and forgot about this dish altogether - leaving my wife puzzled - and alone on her quest to figure it out.A super nice, small, intimate spot to grab a bite in Barcelona.
