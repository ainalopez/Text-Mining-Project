    "four languages herefriendly staff friendly food stuffgazpacho dreamingGet ready to spend some cash money here. It is not cheap, but a nice nice place to share a few tapas, drink good wine, before drinking and eating something heartier. The highlight for me was the lobster gazpacho and croquetas. Sadly, I couldn't afford dessert, but left a happy customer. And we went back.",
