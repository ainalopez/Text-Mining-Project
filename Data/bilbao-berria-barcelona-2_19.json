    "I have only been to the \"pintxos\" part of this place (not to be confused with tapas) but that is all I need to have experienced to be happy! It is a bit overwhelming because they have a huge spread and it is self service, but trust me everything is wonderful! So be adventurous and grab something off the bar (anything because you'll be getting up for more) and order a bottle of wine...you'll be here for a while!Wednesdays are 1\u20ac pintxos! Only in the winter though :'( once tourists start popping up in the spring your wallet will soon find out that the deal is no more!Even with the \"tourist\" surcharge in the spring, you don't want to miss out on this! It's literally right next to the cathedral so this place has your \"communion\" covered with the wine and bread you'll be consuming ;)Easiest way to get here is the Jaume I metro stop (yellow line) walk to the cathedral and you'll see it next to the waffle place",
