    "One of the best classic fresh food in barcelona,located in the heart of el born zone,bit pricey but worth it,come as early as you can as cal pep is pretty small,saut\u00e9ed cockles with parsley,spanish omelette with all i oli, pan con tomate,meat balls with squid and grilled red prawns is a must,just AVOID any other tapas bar at el Born zone,most of all the one that has a large tapas FOOD CHAIN in that zone as it really a TOURIST TRAP.",
