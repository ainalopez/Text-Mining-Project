    "Stumbled upon while looking for late night takeaway and boy were we glad we did! \u00a0The owners were very accommodating and friendly and the food was outstanding! The empanadas were fresh and flavorful and the homemade gnocchis were as good, if not better, than most Italian restaurants I've been to. \u00a0If you're in Barcelona, it's a hidden gem worth checking out.",
