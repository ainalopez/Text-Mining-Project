    "What a wonderful experience. It's standing room only for the most part, but it's still worth it. Take a look at the variety of Tappas, pick the ones you want, keep on picking till you are satisfied, keep the toothpicks on your plate and, at the end, pay by the number of toothpicks on your plate. \u00a0The food is delicious and many times you need to fight for the ones just coming out because people are ready to snatch them.",
