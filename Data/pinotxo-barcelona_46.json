    "excellent for tourists and wasn't that crowded on a weekday morning. \u00a0opens at 6:30 but more food ready by 8 am when the market opens. \u00a0had the sardinas, croquettas, salchicha, bistec, chickpeas, cafe, everything fresh, on point. \u00a0nice use of sea salt, but on the heavy salting side.",
