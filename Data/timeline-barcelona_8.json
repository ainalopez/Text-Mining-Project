    "We were hunting for some good tapas to kill time before Parc G\u00fcell, and we couldn't have been happier with our choice. Although the seating is very limited, Timeline is off the beaten path and a great escape from the touristy crowds. For only \u20ac18 per person we each got 2 tapas plates, choice of mini pancakes, unlimited pinches from the mini buffet and choice of bottomless - that's right bottomless - mimosas or bloody marys. The tapas choices weren't necessarily traditional, but the overall vibe and quality of food made this an incredible find. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick-ish bite around Parc G\u00fcell!",
