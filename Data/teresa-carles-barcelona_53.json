    "This restaurant was a great find in Barcelona. A full server sit down place serving quality vegetarian fare. After eating tapas for like four straight nights an actual restaurant was much appreciated. Both of our main dishes were great. The only knock against them is the waiter's refusal to bring us tap water. Despite seeing pitchers of tap water on several other tables he kept insisting \"it is not possible\".",
