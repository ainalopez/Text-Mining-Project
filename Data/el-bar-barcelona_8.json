    "This restaurant is unbelievable. My wife and I have been in Barcelona for 8 days and this was our favorite restaurant. It's a gem unknown to most tourists it seems but is slammed after 9:30 with locals. Unlike all restaurants this place has its own unique flavor. The staff is warm and make you feel like a 5 star guest only the prices are very reasonable. Cheese and olives to start and unique truffle chocolates to finish. We ordered the pork and pasta of some sort of which were both extremely flavorful and shockingly good. Descriptions are short so you don't know what to expect and then are surprised by the goodness. Bottom line we went there our last two nights and if we return to Barcelona this is our place to go. My time is full so no restaurant has excited me enough to actually write a review. But I'm happy to support this owner, chef and staff all of whom you will meet!",
