    "It is nearly impossible to have a bad meal when you have the freshest produce within an arm's reach. \u00a0This fact was repeatedly affirmed as we dined in various restaurants dotted within several market places, including El Quim.Although not known for being a \"cheap eat\", it was definitely one of the most delicious venues and worth a trip out to try for yourself. \u00a0Anything grilled was fantastic, with both the razor clams and prawns being stand-outs in my mind.The menu may seem large and unwieldy at first glance, but life is easier if you make sure you have the English version (haha). \u00a0But seriously, even if you just closed your eyes and pointed randomly at the menu to order, you couldn't really go wrong with whatever you picked and a local beer in hand. \u00a0If it sounds good, I'll be you that it is certainly going to taste even better.",
