    "When looking for good food, came accross Parrilla Alfonsina. Greeted with nothing but smiles, we got placed at a nice table even though the place was packed with reservations. Before anything else, the waiter came out and showed the different kinds of steak they had on the card that day, taking the time to explain a bit more about the meat served. The Tenderloin steak that I took was amazingly soft; probaply the best steak I've eaten in a few years..! As a starter we had three kinds of Argentinian empanadas; again, really really good.One minor thing we experienced was that, while we were still enjoying our main course, the owner came to us and asked us if we would be so kind to move to a different table due to a large party awaiting seating. The timing was not very good as we were in such a good mood, which was a bit dissapointing.Overall report: excellent service, better food, great atmosphere. Will definitely visit again when in Barcelona!",
