    "Must visit while in Barcelona. \u00a0 Fresh, inexpensive and delicious. \u00a0Lucky for us our rental was on the same street and am glad we tried early as we were back every day during the trip, often waiting for them to open their doors. \u00a0 Hugely popular (especially with students) and for good reason. \u00a0Try the sauces, vegetarian in the family raved (as did everyone else).",
