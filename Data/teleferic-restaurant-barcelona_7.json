    "The good: the food was very excellent. \u00a0As an American it's different and not what you're used to. Tapas obviously are small plates. My advice, look at the different prices (each style of stick has a different price) and then grab some items, 2-5 depending on hunger level. All said my wife and I ate here, we each had 5 tapas and an item off the menu which we shared, plus 2 sangria's and it was 60\u20ac with the tip.The bad: the service wasn't great. Our server was super helpful in the beginning but when we wanted another drink it was impossible. We sat waiting for 10 minutes trying to order a drink and got nowhere so we paid and left. Maybe that's how the Spanish culture operates and I'm just an ignorant American. I'd give this place 5 stars if the server had been a little more attentive",
