    "Service was excellent. The lobster paella, however, was extremely disappointing. Seemed like rice soaked in Worcester sauce (salty, heavy, soggy). It made it difficult to taste the lobster meat once liberated.Beer or wine by the glass is limited to house options but good.I would have given 3 stars, but for the price, I expect much more.",
