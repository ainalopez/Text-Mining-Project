    "The best meal we have ever had. This was our honeymoon meal and we planned for this dinner to happen when we arrived in Barcelona. Well, of course AA had delays. We had a choice to arrive in Barcelona that day without our luggage and we took it because of these reservations. We made the right choice! Everything was beautiful and perfectly timed. We loved the food and the experience.",
