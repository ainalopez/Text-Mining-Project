    "Great service, amazing ambiance and perfectly concocted cocktails! Quaint and charming.THE best espresso martini that has ever touched my tongue. My hubs agreed. It was a perfect little dessert after a big dinner we had down the street. Creamy and rich, but not too much; just sweet enough and a wonderful dark espresso flavor. I wish I could bring this drink back home with me. One spot I will absolutely be coming back to on my next Barcelona trip.",
