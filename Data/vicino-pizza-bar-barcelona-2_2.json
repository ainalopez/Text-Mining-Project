    "Delicious and friendly, fast service. Pizza and focaccia were my favourites. Susanna is fabulous! The setting is great - indoors is just as nice - especially in front of the pizza oven as it's very cool to see these guys work their craft - so don't be turned off if they don't have outdoor seating.",
