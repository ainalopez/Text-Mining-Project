    "Do you like sea food? Then you HAVE to go to La Paradeta, ok ok you NEED to go! Seafood is fresh and cooked to order, not only that you also get to select your own seafood! It is a culinary experience! Grilled octopus is delicious, grilled tuna awesomely tasty, grilled shrimp was very good, everything we ordered was so good. We went there for dinner twice on our trip. Make sure that you get there 20 minutes before they open there will be a line, but it is so worth it, once they open the line goes fast and the food comes out fast and deliciously prepared!! LOVE this place!Este restaurant es delicioso, toda una experiencia culinaria! Todo lo que pides les queda delicioso, no olvides de llegar 20 minutos antes de abran porq va a haber l\u00ednea para entrar y ordenar. Me encanta este lugar!",
