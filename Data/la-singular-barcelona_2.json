    "Nice place we stumbled upon (thanks to Yelp!) when the kitchen of our original choice was closed at 11 PM on a Saturday night. What a great little spot, unpretentious, friendly, a little peeling paint, etc. Not touristy, so don't expect much English. But very good food; take their recommendations.",
