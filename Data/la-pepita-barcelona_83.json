    "Thank Yelp for pointing us out to a great place to eat in Spain!The food in Spain is okay. \u00a0We weren't really impressed. \u00a0If you go, stick to Tapas. \u00a0BTW, La Pepita is a great Tapas bar.We got there pretty early so we were able to snag a seat here... but a few people were turned away later in the night because you need reservations for this place. \u00a0It's a small bar and it got super crowded by the end of our meal.Almost all the tapas we ordered from La Pepita were oh so delicious. \u00a0In addition to the tapas, we all got our own pepita (a sandwich). \u00a0There are several kinds of pepitas you could get.Also, dessert was good. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place to my friends. ***** The only negative was one of the guys with us woke up violently ill later on that night with food poisoning. \u00a0We're pretty sure it was from this restaurant because we all shared every meal during out trip. \u00a0Except for his only hamburguesa pepita. \u00a0Although, he said the food poisoning was worth it because it tasted good. \u00a0****Oh, the desserts here are pretty good too!",
