    "Like 6 restaurants and bars in one big space, the decor is unique and even though each \"section\" was themed, they kept the feel of the entire place unified. We wandered in a big circle before settling in at the bar closest to the entrance. We ordered the meat platter and the cheese platter - both were delicious and had a great selection. The jamon here was the highest quality and best tasting I had in Barcelona. I watched an older gentleman slowly carve off thin slices of jamon in front of us with care and precision. We did not try any of the other spots here but I'm sure there's more to love at El Nacional... Try it out for yourself!",
