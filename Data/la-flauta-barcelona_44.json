    "We ordered many things. For the most part, each dish shared one (or all) of these characteristics: it was oily, it was fried, it was too sweet.For example: 2 sticks of Brie, fried and breaded. Or the fried potato sticks with a runny egg and mayonnaise, (I believe).Or the pieces of toasted bread, drizzled with olive oil and rubbed with tomato.Or the two cubes of beef, topped with a red jam.I am going to have a heart attack if I keep eating in Barcelona. Pleasant staff, I'll say that about the place. One star for service.",
