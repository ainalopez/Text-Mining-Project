    "We stopped in for a quick bite en route to sightseeing and thought the crepes were delicious. \u00a0I had a tomato and spinach crepe - and was pleasantly surprised to taste really whole juicy tomato slices and a slightly crispy/chewy crepe which is exactly the way I like it. \u00a0My friend had a tomato and emmenthal crepe and also enjoyed hers. \u00a0It's a cute place too, and supposedly it's been around since 1999! \u00a0I'd come back again.",
