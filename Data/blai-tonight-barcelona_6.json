    "A great introduction to pintxos. Go up, grab your plate, order some frosty mugs of beer and just start eating. Keep your toothpicks and pay up front where they count the toothpicks, add up your drink order, and give you an amount to pay. Owing to the popularity of the place as a 'pintxos primer' all the staff speak English well.And of course there's the price. Every pintxo here is 1 euro apiece. (So 1 toothpick = 1 euro so you can keep track of that in your head while you eat.)My only complaint is that the pintxos weren't mind blowingly awesome. They were a great intro, but fortified by this experience we tried other places, and had more interesting and more carefully prepared pintxos that cost a little more, but were quite a lot better.So, this is definitely a pintxo dive bar for me, and there's a time and place for it and I would go even if i were a local. But it'd be mostly for when I want something cheap and OK tasting. It would also be much more fun with a large group of friends, where you have something else to do besides eat and drink, as was the case with me. :)",
