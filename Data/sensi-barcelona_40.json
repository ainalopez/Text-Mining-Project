    "My 3 friends and I went here for a late dinner the other night. We booked reservations earlier in the day - recommend making a reservations as the restaurant is small. We each ordered 2 tapas plates to be shared - perfect amount. The red sangria was delicious and the service was wonderful. We really enjoyed our dinner here! Seafood paella was my favorite! Make sure to ask for an after dinner shot.",
