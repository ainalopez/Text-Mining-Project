    "Fun spot for a private function.Dry Martini bar is a classic cocktail bar in central Barcelona. Most people think, given the old-fashioned trappings, that walking in the front door already puts them in the \"speakeasy\" but it's actually much secret-er.With the right help from the hosts up front (or, as in our case, a booked event) you can secure permission to go through the doors to the kitchen, past all the hustle and bustle, to a back room with its own bar, its own staff, and its own, moodier vibe. They've got good bottles on the shelf, and good bartenders in front of it; capable and not particularly showy about it. For the get together we had planned, it was a perfect space - interesting and different but not out-competing the guests for attention.Pro-tip - the steak tartare crostini with the quail egg on top?
