    "Ate here last night. \u00a0This was the BEST! \u00a0The freshest seafood you could imagine. \u00a0Pick out your pleasure and they take it back to the kitchen and cook it to your order. \u00a0No table service, who needs it? \u00a0 For us, it was. Sip some Chardonnay and wait for them to call \"Mesa quince\" (Table 15). \u00a0We had a magnificent tuna steak, mussels, and giant prawns rounded out with a nice dry Spanish Chardonnay and a fresh salad.",
