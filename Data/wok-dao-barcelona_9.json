    "As other have stated, this place is awesome.The seafood selection is huge, with fresh (fresh!) scrimps, salmon, squid, mussels, etc. The buffet bar is large and should cater to all eaters.There is also a grill bar where you select your fresh meats (we didn't try this), fresh seafood, veggies and they grill it for you. SWEEEET!!My wife and I are only in Barcelona only for 3 days and we may just visit this place again.",
