    "I have to say that I am not gonna give the fifth star because I have found it a bit too expensive. It is a tapas place with italian roots. The quality of the food is very, very, very high, and they have an incredible wine selection (all ecological). Service is slow and sometimes you need to fight to get noticed by the busy waiters..but, overall, a place worth to try at least once. Here you can find some dishes hard to find outside Italy. Must try burrata, porchetta, tomino and the mussels.",
