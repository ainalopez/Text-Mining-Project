    "I had a great meal here in this super cute spot after our original destination was jam packed. From the salmon salad (which the salmon appears in a sort of super fresh salsa form) to my mushroom, quail egg, and Serrano ham bake, everything was beautiful and satisfying. My dish contained mushrooms of such a unique variety that I initially thought they were pasta. The only thing I have to note is that I felt like my boyfriend was pressured into buying a bottle of wine somewhat, when we knew we didn't really have room for it. We made it fit, and then passed out promptly after (when that wasn't the intended plan for our night.) Other than that, I definitely recommend. Also, extremely affordable. $35 for two entrees,a salad, bread and a bottle of wine.",
