    "I had the \"Virus Killer\" smoothie: Pear, water, lemon, ginger, honey, Echinacea, thyme, Maria Luisa, & rock tea. I also had the Salmon Tofu: tofu marinated with beets, mushrooms, stir-fried spinach, asparagus, and some sort of tasty thyme sauce.Both were extremely delicious. The salmon tofu was exceptional... it was flavorful, satisfying, and quite filling.My fiance ordered a salad, which was kind of pitiful looking. It looked like it was thrown together in about 1-2 minutes with raw ingredients. If you are hungry and hoping for a more satisfying, non-raw meal, I would suggest not ordering a salad. I felt very bad for him after seeing his plate, compared to my decadent salmon tofu.Overall, we both still enjoyed our meals. I give this restaurant 3-stars rather than something higher only because my fiance and I -almost immediately after our meal- both had the runs and both a bad stomachache.If the smoothies are laxatives, then perhaps that should be disclosed. The food was delicious and the meal enjoyable... just not the experience afterward. Therefore, I'm not sure I would come back again.",
