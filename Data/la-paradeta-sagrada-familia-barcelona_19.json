    "Cheap delicious seafood cooked after you pick it. I love this place. I wish I could eat here all the time.It's a simple set up with a counter where all seafood displayed and you line up and pick what you'd like and how you want them cooked either a la plancha ie. grilled. Then you get your drink and wait till your number is called and you collected the plates of goodness.The highlight was the razor clams with green sauce that was a huge portion. We had a feast with fried squid, steamed mussels, and raw oysters. The oysters were large salty Mediterranean ones. \u00a0For three people and at least a pound each of razor clams, mussels and squid was only 47 euros.",
