    "This place was great. The atmosphere is a little bare but you go for the food. The honey mustard pork ribs were fantastic and fell right off the bone. I'd also recommend the lamb skewers, the \"bombs,\" and the beef cheek. Order 4-5 plates and take a chance!Our server was friendly, attentive, and spoke perfect English. He also made great recommendations.If I were here one more day, I'd go back in a second.",
