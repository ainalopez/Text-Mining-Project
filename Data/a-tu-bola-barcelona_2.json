    "Food (5 Stars) - They serve about 8 different type of meatball served mainly on a pita bread like a sandwich or on a plat with coleslaw+green apple, which was quite interesting. You get 3 meatballs for the plate and 2 for pita. The downside is you can only choose 1 flavor out of many of their selections. I wish I coulda tried more. Sweet potato one was not that impressive and lacks definite taste. The Mexican style one was pretty good with enough meaty and spicy taste to stimulate your bud.Service (4 Stars) - The female cook seemed a little irritated by my initial presence because I couldn't speak Spanish or some other odd reason; however, she quickly got really friendly (maybe she was having a bad day and is acting professional?). If you are sitting inside the restaurant the bar around the cooking area is just a turnaway to grab the food. Convenient and fun!Ambiance (4 Stars) - Cute snacky bar like setting. Does not accomodate large group. I think there were only one or two big table for 4 ppl and rest were just standing bar chair surrounding the walls.",
