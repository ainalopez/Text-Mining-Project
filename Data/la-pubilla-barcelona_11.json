    "Yes Yes Yes...don't get the wrong idea it is not 5 stars as in fine dining, but if you want a local restaurant that hits is modern but traditional and not touristy then this is it!! They have limited dishes but everything we had both times we went were outstanding.This is more for a true foodie. \u00a0Thomas Keller and others chefs books as well as a copy of Larousse are on the shelves.Note it is in Gracia neighborhood which is an excellent place to walk around if you want to be in a more local neighborhood. \u00a0There are two markets in the neighborhood (one across from the restaurant) and both had a better feel then the main La Bouqeria.",
