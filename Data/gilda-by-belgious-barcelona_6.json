    "Delightful, small, Spanish twist to some Belgian food.We had stew, (great), and tenderloin,(very good), preceded by some croquet with spinach, et al. Also very good.Only 1 wine per varietal available per glass, but a list is available.The Belgian ice cream with cinnamon WAS a nice finish. Young start up restaurant, Sade playing over and over, youngsters coming in, and so try it since it was inexpensive.",
