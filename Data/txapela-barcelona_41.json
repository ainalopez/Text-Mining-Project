    "My boyfriend and I agreed that this was our best meal of our entire 3 country trip. It's always busy, so expect even more of a delay and wait for dinner. I love that they gave a placemat with pictures of all the tapas for you to choose. We are still dreaming of the marinated pork loin skewer and shrimp, bacon and mushroom combination. I would go back to Barcelona just for this meal.",
