    "After 48 hours on the road, and in the air, \u00a0Barcelona presents itself worthy with all things traditional at Gent del Barri. Starting with a refreshing Cava sangria, \u00a0with lots of fresh fruit and a sparkling crisp finish followed by the cerde plate. Flavorful thin strips of pork loin with crispy potatoes \u00a0(french fries), salad, \u00a0grilled tomatoes, \u00a0peppers and eggplant. Service was fast and prices were very good.",
