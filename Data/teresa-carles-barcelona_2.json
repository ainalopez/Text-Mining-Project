    "Researching vegetarian options for Barcelona offered Teresa Carles. \u00a0We got reservations & so happy we did as the place was PACKED when we got there at the early hour of 8pmStarted with a pitcher of sangria....awesome & powerful - we wanted another pitcher but were feeling pretty happy after the one so decided to be smart Appetizers included the vegan Ceviche, Mushroom Croquettes & Padron Peppers. \u00a0I'd never had ceviche but the Mr said it was really close to the real thing ( back from his meaty days )We split our entrees of the Tofu Salmon w/ asparagus and the Aubergine CakeThe \"salmon\" was really nice & something totally different from what I usually order.....made for a lovely \"seafood\" eveningI'm usually not an eggplant fan but the aubergine cake was nice - layers of eggplant & lots of goat cheese. \u00a0The eggplant was cooked very well & no hint of sliminessDesserts included the Mille Feuille & the Snowflake Cake. \u00a0The snowflake cake was totally dense & almost like a pound cake with diced fruit - very tasty!The Mille-Feuille was like a napolean with crispy layers & fresh fruitOverall lovely evening & we left there with full tummies & being huge fans",
