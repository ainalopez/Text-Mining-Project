    "Ambience: 5Food: 5Service: 3The interior is well decorated and very classy. We went around 2pm which is pretty busy but still some empty tables. The most annoying thing about this restaurant is that the servers are SO SLOW. We waited a couple minutes just to be seated and then we had to grab our own menus and waited more than 10 minutes until a server came and she didn't speak English so we had to wait even more for a different server. She suggested the the sangria which was AMAZING, the best I've had in Spain and the fresh catch of the day, a white fish prepared with grilled vegetables and potatoes on the side. We also got a starter of bread with tomatoes. The main dish was pretty pricey ($30 per person) but worth it, as the fish was very tender and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. The waitress also conveniently skinned most of the meat right before serving in front of us so we wouldn't have to deal with all the bones. I would recommend eating here but not if you're in a hurry because the service is so slow at first.",
