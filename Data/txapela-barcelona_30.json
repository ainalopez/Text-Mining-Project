    "I love this place!!! We have stopped in 3 or 4 times for little bites of deliciousness!!! We like to sit at the bar and just point at what looks good! \u00a0They are tiny, 2 bite tapas that are so good! Our favs are the cod/aioli, tortilla w shrimp & mushroom, & cannelloni, plus rice pudding for dessert! The female bartenders are friendly and will help you select the most tasty pics of the night. There are 50 different mini tapas! So much fun and right by our hotel on the Gran Via, HC Hotel Pasiege de Gracia!",
