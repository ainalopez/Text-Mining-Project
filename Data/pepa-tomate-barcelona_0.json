    "Wonderful!Superb!There's a couple of plates that make this tapa place one of my very favorite tapa restaurants, ever!Situated in the heart of Gracia this darling restaurant is the perfect location for a lunch on your way to Parc Guell, or a dinner before enjoying Gracia night life!Try the truffle oil zucchini salad or the spinach croquettes and you will not regret!Not to mentioned \u00a0the Anis seeds sorbet or the home made tiramisu. Both to die for!",
