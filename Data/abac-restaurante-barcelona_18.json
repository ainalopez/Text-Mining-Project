    "Best things I ever ate in Spain were had here. Forget paella, I will gladly take one portion of that shaved foie gras and truffle with onion soup for the rest of my days. If there is an option for a la carte or tasting menu, I beg you... Please do the tasting menu. Service, surroundings... Perfection. \u00a0Didn't stay at the hotel ( too out of the way for us tourists on a tight schedule) but it looked swanky. Look forward to returning one day.",
