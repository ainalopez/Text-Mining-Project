    "Bormuth was one of our best values on the trip. The prices are relatively cheap, and the tapas are good. We particularly liked the fried peppers and the white anchovies in vinegar. Also, the atmosphere is lively, and if you sit upstairs you can have fun people-watching. The service is...hectic.",
