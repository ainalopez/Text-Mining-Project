    "My husband and I recently stopped in for some cerveza and tapas. The menu is short but varied. We ordered artichoke chips, veal with chimichanga sauce, tempura asparagus, patatas bravas, and some beer. The veggie dishes were great but the veal was just ok. Our waiter spoke English and was very helpful. We were going to order a dessert but were full after having the tapas. If we go back again I will try to save room for dessert.",
