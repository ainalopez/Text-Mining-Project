    "We really enjoyed this place a lot -- it is one of the coolest looking restaurants we've seen in a while being a combination of an upscale food market and a restaurant. \u00a0I ordered some kind of charcoal grilled octopus which was one of the most amazing and unusual things I've ever put in my mouth. \u00a0I expected it to be rubbery but it was really tender and had a unique smoky flavor. \u00a0This should definitely be on the Barcelona agenda. \u00a0Also the \"unitoilet\" bathroom deserves a picture (I think there is already one posted on here)!",
