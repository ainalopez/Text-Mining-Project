    "Tapeo had great reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor and was, fortunately, just a short walk from our AirBnB flat. We came at tourist dinnertime (7:15pm) and the only available seating was at the bar. If you plan on coming here after 7pm you really need to make a reservation. We sat at the end of the bar closest to the entrance and tourists came up asking how long the wait was maybe 15 times during our meal. They were all told they could wait to see if a reservation failed to show but couldn't be guaranteed a seat. So, while this was a bit annoying for us, we still felt fortunate to have been seated at all. We had the croquetas de jamon iberico which are relatively inexpensive and also sinfully delicious. We had the papas con salmon y wasabi which was good but would have been better without the potatoes in my opinion. It had the consistency of salmon tartare. We had the lamb in yoghurt sauce which my husband like but I thought was okay (lamb was cooked well done on a skewer). We ordered rabbit ribs and they were hilariously and appropriate tiny. They tasted like chicken and came with a yummy dipping sauce. Lastly, since we had been drinking, we ordered the beef sweetbreads. If you don't know what sweetbreads are you can look it up but they do not contain bread :) They were quite good and a very large portion as well. Altogether, this felt like an authentic tapas experience. Five tapas, 1/2 litre sangria, bottled water, and two beers came out to under 60 euro which I thought was an excellent deal. I certainly reccomend.",
