    "Great seafood paella! The wait time for the paella is 30 minutes according to the menu. It took closer to 45 minutes but it was worth the wait! We shared a delicious bottle of red wine but got attitude from the waitress for choosing red wine with seafood. She was in general not very friendly and the only negative aspect of this place.Still worth a visit!",
