    "This is a really great place for sweets--chocolates, hot chocolate, cheesecake with strawberries, etc. Everything we had tasted great. The atmosphere is very nice, and there are even two very comfy sort chairs with a little table, in addition to several other tables with wooden chairs. It's a tiny place, but it's a great place to rest your feet and get some coffee and sweets when it's not too busy.",
