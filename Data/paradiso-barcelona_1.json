    "Last night I ended up waiting in line to get into this place without even knowing what it really was, but the excitement of the people in the line made me want to know about the hype of this bar. It took like 15 or 20 minutes to get to the door, guarded by a guy, just like a club. He warned us that we would have to have our drinks standing up because there were no more sits available, but that was fine for us after waiting in line for 20 minutes. However, when we passed through the door, a very kind waitress took us to a corner with two stools. The decoration was the first thing that kept my attention because it was stunning, with low lights and a mix of vintage and modern styles. The music was also very cool, with a DJ playing live chill-out, but maybe too loud and it was pretty hard to hear anything else. After reading the list of cocktails like maybe 8 times (because I am very indecisive and everything looked and sounded too amazing) I ordered a Caribbean cocktail and my friend went for a Samurai Sling. The staff was very polite and never stopped looking after us and asking if everything was right, but they were actually very slow because we didn't got our drinks after 20 more minutes (I have to say that the local was extremely overcrowded so I could understand the wait). The cocktails were very very good, with lots of details, super flavorful and beautifully crafted, plus the size of both was more than okay. I'm sorry for giving them four stars (knowing that everyone rates them with five) but the only thing I'm complaining about is the volume of the music because I couldn't even have a talk with my friend without yelling. Anyways, I highly recommend to try their amazing drinks. I will go back soon, hoping to update my review to five stars.",
