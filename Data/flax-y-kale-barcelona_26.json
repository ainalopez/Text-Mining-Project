    "Tired of a life of partying non stop, we decided to stop by this place for an afternoon lunch. Food was pretty decent and desert was yumi. \u00a0Although I found it a bit pricey, it was worth the trouble.The problem was the service. OMG. Slow as it could be. \u00a0Careless. \u00a0I became very frustrated after a while, and all I wanted to do was to leave! The place itself is gorgeous. \u00a0I ordered some wild salmon with quinoa salad, and it was delicious. \u00a0My friend had the ceviche, which was marvelous.",
