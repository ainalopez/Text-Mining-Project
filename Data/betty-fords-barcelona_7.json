    "I make it a point to come through whenever I come to Barcelona. The music is usually good, the bartenders are awesome, so is the owner. I think the thing that really distinguishes it is a hard to articulate sense of welcoming. It seems like the kind of place that really wants you to feel at home and that it would only take a short while to be considered a regular, or even a friend.They serve burgers now, too. All my Spanish friends seem to think the burgers are amazing. If you're from the States, you'll only think they're okay. Who cares, though.",
