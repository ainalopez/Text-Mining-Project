    "Agua is awesome! While in Barcelona, you have a lot of options for Restaurants! Don't miss out on this one! This place is an authentic Catalonian Restaurant! The Tapas are bomb, main courses are great! A must try are the black muscles! Also ask what the local fish of the day is...so many options! You can't go wrong on any of them! Also, I was so surprised how inexpensive the bottle of wines are! Very reasonable if you are a baller on a budget (like myself). The service is spot on too.Besides the food and service, the location is just as great! Right on the beach and right next to all the nightclubs! I recommend making reservations at night, have a nice dinner then hang around and hit up one of the nightclubs next door like Opium! Untz Untz Untz!Just a note: the nightclubs don't start until after 11:30pm, but you can go in earlier for cocktails and lounge around!Enjoy!",
