    "We arrived at a weird hour, apparently--around 7:30--and found the place suspiciously deserted, almost left right then to find a busier spot just to make sure the food turnaround would be adequate. Decided to risk it anyway and BOY! were we glad. Catalan style food court had great selection of tapas from different kiosk-style restaurants with comfortable seating in the middle of the room. Excellent quality food, quick preparation, very affordable, maximum options. And ... by the time we left around 9:00pm, the place was packed--local crowd just getting their second wind. Highly recommended.",
