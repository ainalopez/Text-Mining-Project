    "After visiting the Picasso Museum (which, side note, you should get tickets online for because the line for tickets there is absurd), we were hungry for lunch so we headed on over to El Xampanyet, which is less than a block down from the museum.Don't be too intimidated by the line outside. Remember that when it comes to tapas, you need to put your food down otherwise you won't be served - so be aggressive. Thank the heavens because we were able to find a seat immediately, even though it was a little cramped.You can order things off the menu (which, by the way, is completely in Spanish), but there were some bites I wanted that were at the counter. Being the frightened tourist I was, at first I was extremely reluctant to go up to the counter to get some grub. But hunger got the best of me so I went up and ordered and was rewarded with beautiful potato and chorizo, salmon salad... great, great stuff. I went up again and ordered a plate of jam\u00f3n iberico with a side of tomato bread. It's a must for sure.El Xampanyet is easily one of my favorite places in Barcelona. It's authentic and the staff, even when I stumbled on a couple of words, were friendly and most importantly, quick.",
