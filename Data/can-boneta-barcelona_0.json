    "An exquisite restaurant that we were brought to on FoodLover tour - the ambience was intimate and casual - seems only local come hereThe chef is a former architect and his dishes show the precision of his former trade. My absolute favorite dish was the octopus over creamy mashed potatoes. The perfect texture / cook on octupus - amazing mashed potatoes to finish off. Please eat here!",
