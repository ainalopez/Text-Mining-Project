    "Found on YELP and what a find!!!! \u00a0 Spent the day walking around all the sites on Montjuic and were starved so finding this place was particularly appropriate to get lots of food. \u00a0 Well for a bit of a foodie and picky person I was beyond impressed. \u00a0Everything was brought out on trays one after the other totally fresh made from the back and beyond delicious. \u00a0My husband let me do all the picking and I found three salmon, three vege, three meat and cheese mixtures and two stuffed croquet. \u00a0The cava was outstanding and the Volle Damm beer was great too. \u00a0We got lucky because we came pretty early so even though it was busy when we got there it slowed down. \u00a0By the time we left a couple of hours later it was packed again. \u00a0 Offered to share our table with two women who turned out to be out for St Gordi day (like Valentine's Day). \u00a0Got a great suggestion to go to Sitges. \u00a0Going there today!",
