    "3 for food, 4 for bar. Great atmosphere and live music. Food was too greasy for me. The salad came inedibly drenched with low quality oil. I got a new salad with no oil. There is much better and similarly priced food in Barcelona, but if you're in the area and want to see a cute dive bar check it out. Nice friendly low-key atmosphere with people enjoying conversation, music, cider, and beer. Also I did not try the vegan burgers, maybe they are edible? I'm always glad to see vegan options, however my preference is for smaller portions with higher quality so if I come here again it will be just for drinks and music!",
