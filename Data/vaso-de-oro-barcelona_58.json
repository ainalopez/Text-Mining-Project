    "For those looking for authentic tapas, venture away from the over-priced trappings of the Ramblas to El Vaso de Oro. It's small, noisy and packed with locals, who come for the home-brewed German style beer but also a great selction of tapas at very reasonable prices. There is a great atmosphere and the long, thin bar means everyone is sat facing the kitchen, the place positively hums on a evening and the staff are a friendly, cheery bunch. We happily wolfed down a selection from sherry-braised chorizo, savoury padron peppers, grilled prawns and crisp, golden patatas bravas. Mediocre tapas are everywhere in Barcelona, but this place is a little gem worth seeking out!",
