    "I found O'Toxo to be the quintessential tapas bar for Barcelona. \u00a0The place seemed to be a neighborhood restuarant for locals. \u00a0The service was excellent (as most places in Barcelona neighborhoods) and food was diverse, catalan staples, and served fresh. \u00a0The wine options were great too. \u00a0Overall great ambiance when in the Raval. \u00a0 Came here twice during my visit to Barcelona and was the best Tapas bar I came across during my visit to Spain. \u00a0Can't wait to go back.",
