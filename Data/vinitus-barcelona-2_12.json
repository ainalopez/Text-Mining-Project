    "Came to Vinitus based on our Airbnb host's recommendation. What a great first meal in Barcelona. The tapas menu has just the right amount of options and they are truly fresh and delicious. The environment is better than many other tapas places and service is great since there are several waiters/waitresses at your disposition if you require anything.",
