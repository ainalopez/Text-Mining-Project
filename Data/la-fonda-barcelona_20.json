    "My husband and I went for lunch on a recommendation this was the best place for paella. It is near the beach and very close to the metro line. We ordered the special and got mussels, 2 seafood paellas and dessert. The mussels were good, although the red sauce was different than I expected. The paella was very good and portions were huge. In hindsight we should have split the paella because neither of us could finish our plate. Overall a good place with good service, but be sure to ask for an English speaking server if Spanish isn't a strong suite.",
