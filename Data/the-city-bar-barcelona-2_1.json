    "This place has excellent tapas, great cocktails and reasonably priced (and DELICIOUS) entrees! The patates braves was excellent, as was the Eco chicken breast. \u00a0They also have gluten-free options for those with Celiacs. \u00a0Service was great (and they spoke English which is a plus for me given my limited Spanish/Catalon) and they also offer free wifi. \u00a0If you are like me and prefer more mainstream cuisine, I would highly recommend this bar!",
