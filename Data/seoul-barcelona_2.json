    "Was there last night since this was the only open Korean restaurant in town. \u00a0All other Korean restaurants were closed early for some reason. \u00a0Very average food. \u00a0Coming from LA, my expectation was already low for any Korean food outside of LA. \u00a0I would not waste time or money on this place. \u00a0Service was good but the taste of all the popular dishes were very blend and average.",
