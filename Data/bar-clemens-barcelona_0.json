    "Unbelievable!!! I have always dreamed of making it to L\u00e1 Boqueria. I was in awe with the quality of the seafood and meats. I looked around and decided I would eat here. Prices are reasonable and the staff was very attentive. I ordered the mixed seafood plater and my fianc\u00e9 ordered a steak. All plates were cooked perfectly and the flavors were well balanced and simple. You don't have to mask quality with ingredients with sauces or spices. The fresh produce and meats speak for themselves. I was pleased to see the chef head over to a neighboring stall to procure a fresh cut steak for my fianc\u00e9. We had the best mimosas, sangria, papas bravas, pimientos de Padron, and seafood on our trip to Barcelona. We are pleased to find out that they have been in business since 1969 and will most likely be there on our trip back. Do yourself a favor and have a meal here. You won't be disappointed. Bonus - our server acted as our personal guide to the best stalls in the market. They are intent on building relationships here.",
