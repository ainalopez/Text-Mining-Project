    "I went here last night with my friends to show them a typical tapas experience here in Spain. If we hadn't been too eager to eat all the delicious food, I would've taken pictures because all of the tapas were beautiful, and they tasted even better. We started off our night with a typical tortilla de patatas, which this place does very right. We interspersed the rest of our meal with dishes with potatoes, tomatoes, and meat. Also, highly recommend the bombolas with spinach which come with a tomato paste, very typical in Spain, on the side. While the staff do speak mostly Spanish, the host was very welcoming and made sure that the lone group of young Americans felt at home. She makes the Gata Mala the kind of place at which you want to become a regular. 10/10 would recommend. \u00a1Muchas gracias!",
