    "Slowest and most inattentive service ever but the best Paella ever. We came in and it took about 15 minutes between waiting for the menus and flagging down someone to take our order. It is a big restaurant with a bar. The wine and sangria is not that good but I also didn't like any wine in Barcelona. Anyway, we ordered the seafood paella which takes about 30 minutes to make. Paella has this perfect acidic and salty flavor as well as the seafood sweetness. The sausage, chicken, and seafood were just all an amazing mix in this super hot pan of paella. Great food besides the fact that lunch took almost two hours.",
