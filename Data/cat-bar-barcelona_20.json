    "Disappointing food and service. I had a selection of tapas (hummus with carrots, gazpacho, patatas bravas with a basil and tomato sauce, and salad), my BF had the 'Crazy Burger'. Honestly I only enjoyed the potatoes. The rest was very mediocre and bland. Vegan food can be much better than this. Service not great - workers clearly overwhelmed. Not recommended.",
