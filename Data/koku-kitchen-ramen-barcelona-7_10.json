    "Came here with my sister and got the vegetarian ramen! It was so good! We don't eat pork and most all of the other options come with pork, but the vegetarian one was amazing! Lots of flavor! Had their ice cream dessert and it was also really good! Their lemonade is also amazing! The waitress who helped us out was nice, it just took a while for someone to come get our order.",
