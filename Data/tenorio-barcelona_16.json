    "Deceptively large restaurant right on Passeig de Gracia. \u00a0Nice selection on the menu and better quality than eating at most of the restaurants on the nearby Ramblas. \u00a0The service was attentive. \u00a0Like several other restaurants in this part on Barcelona there is an up charge to eat outdoors. \u00a0We took the 15% extra they would have charged us, ate inside and drank another bottle of wine.",
