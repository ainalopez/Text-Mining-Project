    "I stumbled into Domino about a year ago for the first time on the recommendation of a friend. \u00a0I quickly fell in love with many a great thing about the place. \u00a0The warm, open, and exciting environment that its steward, Jessica, has built is absolutely fabulous. \u00a0You can't help but smile in delight as you watch her creative process. \u00a0The cocktails at Domino are special, unique, different. \u00a0My favorite is Maui Dog: a gin based beverage with a delicious touch of lavender syrup that is irresistible. \u00a0Indeed, I've had so many good experiences at Domino that I held my birthday party there last year! \u00a0What an evening, what a place. \u00a0If you're in Poble Sec/Raval, I definitely recommend a visit to Domino!",
