    "The first thing that anyone should know about this place before they make a decision to come here is that it's targeted at young people. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. Good in that it's very fun for young people to mix and mingle, and also eat as many 1\u20ac pinchos and drink as many 3\u20ac sangrias as they'd like. Bad in that this place is kind of awkward for older people who perhaps might be looking for a more refined place to get pinchos or tapas.Objectively speaking, La Tasqueta de Blai serves very cheap and very good (especially for the price) pinchos and drinks. The staff here is really fun and they all dance to whatever American pop song is playing.I hate to say this, especially with all of the rave reviews, but La Tasqueta de Blai isn't quite my cup of tea. Sure, the pinchos were good but not great. You definitely get more than what you pay for, but I felt like the pinchos were slightly Americanized and the place itself was somewhat touristy.",
