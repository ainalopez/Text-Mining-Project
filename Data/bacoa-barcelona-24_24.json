    "I am a big fan of burgers and this place did not dissappoint me one bit - We got there around 9:30pm which was absolutely perfect timing as only 10min later the queue was four times the length we had to wait...We had a Burgos, a Swiss and a Manchega with bravas on the side or all-i-oli potatoes. When ordering, the staff was friendly and we even got a badge from the restaurant :). We could find a table rather easily as you cannot take one before you have your order but we had to wait only a couple minutes to get one. We got our food in less than 15 minutes and the taste was amazing! The selection of ingredients is very nice and it all combines very smoothly. The portion is quite big so, if you take a side (potatoes, fries or salad) it is enough for dinner :) And for 10-12\u20ac!I forgot to mention that we were also given a piece of paper which you could fold to hold your burger and avoid getting food all over you - very convenient! My 5th star goes for that ;)Cheers and enjoy burgering! ;)",
