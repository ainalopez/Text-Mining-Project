    "Opened in 1970 by the catalan photographer Leopoldo Pom\u00e9s this location is still the place to be for young and hip professionals. In its unique white setting with black photographers painted on the wall you have the choice of more than 80 tortillas (Spanish omlettes) and several other simple dishes, such as Hamburger with french fries. Though simple, all are cooked with great care and taste very well. You should also go for one of the homemade delicious desserts. As the prices are not expensive, different types of persons enjoy the place and its speedy service. In the meantime also a Flash Flash restaurant has opened in Madrid.",
