    "Four of us went to Milk for brunch on Easter Sunday. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait, or the restaurant would pay for a cab to take us to their sister restaurant, Marmalade, where they would have a table ready for us by the time we arrived. If that isn't great service, I don't know what is! We sat in the back area, which was decorated very tastefully. A friend and I split the ranchero omelet, which was wonderful. The chorizo and creme fraiche paired so nicely together, and the breakfast potatoes it came with were well-seasoned and crispy. My bloody mary was pricey, but worth the money--super filling and spicy. My friend enjoyed her french toast and mimosa as well. After sitting and chatting for a while, we split an order of the lava cake, which was good but just like any lava cake out there. Our waitress was attentive, and we didn't feel rushed.",
