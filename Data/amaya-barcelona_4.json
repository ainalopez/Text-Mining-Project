    "La Rambla is a crazy place full of people eating, drinking, and locals trying to pick your pocket. But it's charming and smells great and you can buy pretty much anything along the way from groceries to souvenirs to flowers.We found Restaurant Amaya late one night after flying into Barcelona. I'm always wary of restaurants that have pictures of the food, but we quickly realized it was the norm in highly trafficked areas, likely due to the high volume of tourists. My husband had the pizza, which sort of cracked me up (you come to Spain and have pizza???), but he did love it. I ordered the vegetable paella and was not disappointed. The portion was enormous but I just kept saying, \"one more bite... I'll have one more bite.\"Also, the sangria is great but HUGE. We mistakenly ordered two (it costs as much as our food), and it was essentially a soup tureen full of sangria. Order one and split it!",
