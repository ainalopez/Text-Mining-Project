    "The more upscale of Raval's vegetarian options, Teresa Carles is delicious. \u00a0The food is tasty, and features quality vegetables: pretty great! \u00a0The ambience is cool, comfortable, and relaxing. \u00a0The slightly higher prices attract a crowd that is a bit older than what you might expect to run into in any other vegetarian restaurant in Raval. \u00a0This is a great place to go for a lunch with colleagues.I recommend taking advantage of the lunchtime men\u00fa del d\u00eda offer. \u00a0Their lunchtime dishes have never disappointed me!",
