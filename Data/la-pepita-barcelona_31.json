    "Visited the restaurant on black friday and have to say that the reviews are spot on- delicious tapas and warm service! We had a late lunch at 4pm and the place was still bustling. The marinated sea bass, potato bravas, fried eggs with ham and chips, tomato bread and steak with foie gras are really must tries. We had the aubergine fritters, steak skewers, calamari, grilled octopus which were nice too, but would give priority to those mentioned earlier.As other reviews say, this place isn't cheap but the food is good and the wine recommendations, lovely too.",
