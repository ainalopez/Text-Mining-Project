    "Sushi tastes fresh, Miso Salad is one of the best I've tasted. Agedashi tofu is ok but I'm from California and my favorite is Agedashi Tofu from Honda Ya in Orange County. Fixed menu is a great deal. Love the fried chicken rolls and the wasabi tastes pretty fresh. I need to try to the tempura ice cream.",
