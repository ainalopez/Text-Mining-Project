    "Yelp sent me here and I was glad that it did! Its a fusion joint taking different asian flavors and mixing them with Catalonian tapas, but all of it was delicious. I had the pleasure of meeting Daniel Rueda and his family and they were nice enough to hang out and chat for a bit. Their braised chicken dish was awesome, definitely order that. There are a bunch of Filipinos in the kitchen, so it makes sense why the chicken is served with pride :P Overall, great place to check out when you're in the Barri Gothic.",
