    "This was one of my favorite meals in Spain. The freshness and flavors of all the dishes blew me away. Some tips:Pay attention to what day and time it is. When we were there a few days ago, they were only open Monday dinner, Saturday lunch, and Tues-Fri L&D, and closed Sundays. Many restaurants in Barcelona in particular are closed Saturday evenings and all day Sunday, so don't learn the hard way!There will be a line regardless of when you show up, so be prepared to wait. \u00a0However, once you order, the food comes out fairly quickly.While you're waiting in line, look at what the other patrons are ordering and keep those dishes in mind. When you sit down, you won't be given a menu and instead you'll be asked what you like and don't like. Some stuff like the scallops are seasonal. (there's a menu outside to peruse while you're waiting)Now onto my favorites (which was everything!)The prawns were ridiculously expensive (6\u20ac for 1 shrimp) but divine. They were large, succulent, and sweet. If you're in the mood to splurge, go for it!The clams are simply presented in a garlic/white wine broth but again very well done. \u00a0Definitely get an order of tomato pan (basically bread schmeared with tomato) to sop up the juices.The tuna tartare was the best version I ever had. \u00a0Go for it if you're a tartare fan.Finally, we made the best mistake ever. \u00a0I asked for mussels and instead we got mushrooms. \u00a0It was literally a dish of sauteed mushrooms, but holy cow, it was the best mushrooms that I've ever had. \u00a0So glad he misheard us!We left completely satisfied and happy! Definitely make room in your schedule for Cal Pep, you won't regret it.",
