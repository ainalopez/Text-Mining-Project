    "This restaurant is well-tailored to please Americans with super-sized appetites who like large portions and are not picky about quality. \u00a0Think the Olive Garden. \u00a0We were not impressed with anything we had--the bread with olives and onions (focaccia strips) was stale. \u00a0The menu offers many many pasta selections that can be paired with many sauce selections. \u00a0The three we ordered were a bit like pouring a mediocre bottled sauce on pasta.",
