    "Taiwanese Tapas? It seemed a bit gimmick-y to me at first, but let me assure you it really works. I can only guess that this style of cooking and fresh Catalan produce came together in divine intervention. Their specialty is dumplings that are made right in front of you, but I also scarfed down bits of firm tofu and spicy bamboo that would have had the stanchest carnivore salivating. I recommend anything with mushrooms there. Mosquito isn't the cheapest place in Barcelona, but worth it for treating oneself.",
