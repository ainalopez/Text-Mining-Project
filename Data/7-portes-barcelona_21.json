    "I'm not sure this was the best paella I had in Spain. It was good but really not that great.Sangria was good though but expensive. You can get sangria at many other places in BCN that have much better value.They also charge several euros for bread we didn't touch. 1 euro is acceptable but anything more than that I'm not okay with. Most places also ask you if you want bread. I assumed since they brought it without asking, it would be complimentary but clearly not.The restaurant itself is way too big and feels kind of tacky. Service felt really rushed and inauthentic. Really disappointed.",
