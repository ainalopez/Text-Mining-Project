    "Traveled to Barcelona in March, 2012. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best restaurant in all of Spain! \u00a0Yes, we also found this spot thanks to a guide book. \u00a0What a wonderful surprise. \u00a0I was soo impressed i immediately wanted to e-mail the author and say \"Thank You\"! \u00a0This place embodies everything I imagined a Spanish restaurant would be! \u00a0I have been to many fine dining destinations and seriously this place rivals all of them. \u00a0Location: Exterior -hidden and charming / Interior -rustic and chic (background music was super cool- jazz to classical pieces)Food: \u00a0 \u00a0We ordered the \"Menu - Servit a la Barra which consisted of roasted chicken in \u00a0a harvest fruit sauce and potato puree, prefaced by an escarole bacon salad and finished with a lovely apple tartine. \u00a0We were also served this beautiful (seriously) and delicious medley of rustic breads and olives. \u00a0Their house wine was also solidly good. \u00a0Remember to have a carajillo to finish off your meal.Service - Warm, welcoming, friendly. \u00a0We loved our waitress! \u00a0We initially sat at the bar because it was less expensive. \u00a0However, we would have paid full price anyway \u00a0to sit and chat with the servers. \u00a0Do not pass up this place. \u00a0It epitomizes Spain in all of it's splendor.",
