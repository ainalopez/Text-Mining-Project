    "Absolutely fantastic. Each dish that came out was our new favourite and my only regret was that I ordered the patatas bravas. We had the aubergine with honey, boneless pig trotters, sweetbreads with figs, ham croquettes and the cuttlefish pasta. The patatas bravas and the croquettes were our \"safe\" dishes. I would go back for the sweetbreads, the aubergine and the cuttlefish pasta. Great service, good cheap wine and ridiculously good food, HIGHLY recommended!",
