    "A huge selection of tapas at 2 euros each. \u00a0You can choose to stand at the bar which is where you get the real experience, or there is a restaurant with menu in the back. They charge you by the number of toothpicks you have left. \u00a0Great selection of Basque wines. \u00a0Fantastic example of Basque style food in a great location right of Las Ramblas. Nice decor.",
