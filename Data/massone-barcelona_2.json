    "As an Italian living in Barcelona, I come to \"Il Massone\" whenever I feel homesick and need some comfort food. The place is cozier than your grandmother's living room and the waiters are lovely and efficient.I eat here on a weekly basis. Pizza is very good, respecting the Italian standards and prepared with high quality ingredients. A must try is \"Pizza Bufalotta,\" a pizza in which a sizable amount of juicy mozzarella di bufala pleases the senses.Another favorite of mine is \"Spaghetti alle Vongole.\" Pasta with fresh mussels, cherry tomatoes and a sprinkling of parsley to finish things up. The price is fair and the fast service deserves an healthy tip. Fellow Italians and food lovers, pay a visit to \"Il Massone.\"",
