    "My wife and I had rented a room via Airbnb in Barcelona and our host was not answering our calls when we got to the house we were supposed to stay in...we were scared, with all of our baggage in a remote part of a strange city.The nearest restaurant was Salamanca so we went inside....even though we were dressed like refugees and walked into the nicest restaurant in Barcelona, the employees greeted us like we were family. \u00a0They fed us, kept our luggage safe, and treated us like we were the most important guests they had ever had.Diego, one of the servers there, even went to the house that we were supposed to stay in and spoke with the neighbors there to see what was going on with our \"room\" from Airbnb. \u00a0I'll never forget the way that they treated my wife and I when we were in a very vulnerable position. \u00a0The people at Salamanca went above and beyond for us, and it's an experience that I will never forget.Please give this kind of place your business, not because of their kicka** paella, but because of their willingness to help out people in need. \u00a0Love you forever Diego and Salamanca!!!! \u00a0Wishing you all the best!",
