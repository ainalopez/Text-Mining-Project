    "On the last night of our trip to Spain, we were lucky enough to receive a recommendation from a local resident to check out this restaurant. I'm so glad we did!!The atmosphere: A nice but humble restaurant. It's not a fancy place but instead a warm, inviting and lively place. The host greeted us right away and took us to our table. (NOTE: we had a reservation. This is recommended, as the place was quite busy).The food: So, so, so good!! My friend had the penne arribiata, which was perfectly spiced. The tomato sauce was especially good. No jar stuff here! As for me, I had a pasta dish with sausage and shaved truffles in a cream sauce (I don't remember the name). It was very rich but so incredibly tasty. We also split the mozzarella caprese. This was also very good, although we wished they had offered up more tomatoes.The prices: Muy bueno!! After spending all kinds of money while in Barcelona, it was great to have an excellent meal with a decent price!!On my next trip to Barcelona, this will be my first meal!",
