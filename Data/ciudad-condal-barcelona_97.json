    "Popular dinner spot and perfect if you want a huge, rich and colorful tapas dinner at midnight or later. Think garlic shrimp, deep fried artichokes, razor clams, iberico ham and tomato baguettes, asparagus and mushrooms with lots of butter, calamari, etc. For desert cr\u00e8me caramel and chocolate lava cake. Service was average at best.",
