    "This place is situated in such a great location in Las Ramblas by Passeig de Grac\u00eda. Ideal for people watching if you sit outside & you can certainly occupy your time while waiting for a table (which you most likely will) on a nice sunny day. Service wasn't the best (not helpful with suggestions) but food was good. Drinks: sangria was good..not exceptional for Barcelona...a bit too sweet & juicy, but certainly above average (personal preference). Food: razer clams (which I've never had) were totally delicious with great flavor. Calamari was good and not overly breaded or overly oily, both of which are common in the US. The Catalan Cream dessert (cross between flan & creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, I thought) was yummy, as was the cappuccino. This place is Worth trying, but not I don't think it's worth waiting over 45-50 min. If Less than that...give them your name :)",
