    "Delicious tapas and friendly service. Would definitely recommend a reservation but we did stop by around 9 on a Friday without one and ended up being seated quickly with a free glass of cava for our trouble. Jamon, obviously, was great as was the duck dish. Nothing but good things to say about this experience.",
