    "I spent a good 2hrs looking over Yelp restaurant reviews before I went to Barcelona and this was the first place I bookmarked. \u00a0The pics of the sirloin with peppers caught my attention but I was calling BS on reviews that said it was the best steak they ever had. \u00a0I'd have to say it's pretty damn close...it's the salty combo of the padron peppers with the tender beef that made this dish stand out. \u00a0I don't speak any Spanish and the bartender was patient and understanding...I showed him a pic of the dish on Yelp and he said \"10 minutes\" haha. \u00a0They didn't ask how I wanted my meat cooked and it came out a perfect medium rare and incredibly tender. \u00a0A perfect dish.",
