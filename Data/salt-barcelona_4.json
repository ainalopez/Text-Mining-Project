    "This is such a special restaurant! Tucked on the edge of the beach underneath the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W Barcelona - once you experience dining here you will want to come back again and again. The manager Mathieu and his amazingly charming staff will make your meal at Salt one you'll remember. The food is delicious - classic and casual dishes with just the right Catalan touch. Pao and Javi at the bar are the perfect mixologist team. There is no beating the location and the atmosphere is beach/ resort chic. Do yourself a favor and skip some of the more complicated restaurants in town and let yourself unwind with the staff at Salt.",
