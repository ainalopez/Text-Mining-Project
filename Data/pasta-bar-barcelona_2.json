    "This is probably some of the best Italian food I've ever had and I just left a 5 day trip to Rome, Naples, and Florence. Super fresh food. Super quick. Tourist-friendly staff. Did I mention that our amazing full bottle of wine only cost us $8 Euro? Will not disappoint! Make sure to get the soup.",
