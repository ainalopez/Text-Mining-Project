    "This is a hidden gem that you should not miss if you are in Barcelona. Check their website for days/times they are open because it varies. They opened at 19:30 on Tuesday, so we arrived at 19:00 and were the 15th person in line. You will need to get there early and be patient. There is a front room with seated bar settings as well as a back room with a handful of tables for larger groups. There is no menu, just some of the freshest and most delicious tapas you will find. Our server was excellent. He explained the process of hot and cold tapas, bread, main course and dessert. \u00a0Our table of 4 included someone allergic to shellfish and the server brought out alternate items and easily worked around that limitation. Most Americans may not have experienced this dining format, but I highly recommend Cal Pep. They will take care of you and not gouge you in the process. For all the food we ate and all the wine we drank, I expected the bill to be much higher.",
