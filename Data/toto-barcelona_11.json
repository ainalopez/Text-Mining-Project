    "Employing a dark glam backdrop accented by industrial pieces, Toto's dining space could only be described as a Euro bistro set amidst a factory floor. Somehow this works, and I can't explain why.We, a party of 15, was seated at 9 PM with no fuss; service was unexpectedly prompt, too. It could because it was a Wednesday.Portion size was less of an issue as I was taken by the delicately memorable flavors of my clam linguini and the fried peas opener. Clearly much effort has been given to their design and preparation. My table would not have disagreed.",
