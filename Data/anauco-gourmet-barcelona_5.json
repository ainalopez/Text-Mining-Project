    "This meal was really delicious. We started off with a goat cheese salad, which had the perfect balance of flavors between a bit sweet and savory and nutty. Then we shared a burger with Gouda and caramelized onion, and it was delicious - the importance in any burger is using the right meat, and the burger was moist, fresh, and very flavorful. This is truly a unique and yummy spot in Barca and I highly recommend it.",
