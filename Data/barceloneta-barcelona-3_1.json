    "This is the best place to be! I have been to \u00a0a lot of places, Thailand, China, Africa etc. But I allways end up here! Wonder why?I think I have been to Barcelona maybe 10 times the last few years. And this place, oh my gud I dont have the Word to describe this! The beach is amazing, the people are wonderful, good food and drinks, the hotels are beautiful, the streets, animals, shops, sounds, smell, everything is just perfect. It dosent matter why or who you travel with because in this place I can promise you that you will have a wonderful time and it will be a trip you will never forget. It dosent matter when you are coming here, its nice even in January as it is in Juli. So if you need to relax or having a good time, book the trip!",
