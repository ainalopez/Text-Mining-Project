    "The overall experience was great. \u00a0The waiters were very friendly and attentive. \u00a0I love the brunch, but when I ordered a side of hashbrowns I didn't expect it to be the sized of a silver dollar. \u00a0It was about one bite's worth and it was done. \u00a0the pancakes weren't the best, but everything else was great. \u00a0I really enjoyed it. \u00a0I'll go back for more. for sure.",
