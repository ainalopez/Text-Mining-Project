    "Great discovery on a walk about town. \u00a0The menu is a not extensive but what I had was done very well, including tapas that seem to have a modern twist and some simple but very tasty entrees (I had a veal and potato dish, my companion grilled dorado). \u00a0I really liked the space, although it is not a really big restaurant.",
