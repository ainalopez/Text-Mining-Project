    "This was a taste of California cuisine in Barcelona. I went here on the recommendation of a friend and was very impressed. I started with the guacamole which was very good. I then moved onto the tuna and pork tacos. Both were excellent. I closed with the bacon wrapped scallops. My only warning : \u00a0if you are looking for Spanish tapas this is not your place. If you're looking for elevated Spanish food this is also not for you. If you are looking for an elevated place that serves the food you might get in Napa then you're in luck! \u00a0This is great for that. The place was packed with locals so clearly they love the concept. Definitely recommended.",
