    "Great cheese and meats! Service pretty bad. We ordered the fixed menu for two for us, since we didn't think the kids would eat the fixed menu, we ordered fondue for two with assorted breads and fruit, and an open sandwich. Asked what salad would come with it and was told wild mushroom salad. We were never offered a beverage menu if they had any. But the fixed menu came with water and surprisingly a bottle of wine(bad). The waiter put it on the table and left. We couldn't open the water or wine without openers so we sat there looking at the drinks for a while (we were thirsty!) until we caught up with him serving another table and asked to open the drinks. He never took away the extra wine glasses so we put it aside on the windowsill next to us as the table was small for the 5 of us. Salad was good although not what he promised. Meat and cheeses were fantastic! Even made the wine bearable. And then a plate of 7-8 small pieces of bread with slightly melted Brie came out. We were confused. Is this part of the fixed menu? The waiter is always in such a hurry we never really get to ask. This turned out to be our fondue. It just didn't come with 'assorted' breads and fruit. Kids hated it. The fixed menu supposedly comes with desserts and coffee or herbal tea. We never got any dessert and had to practically demand the coffee and tea.(the tea was not herbal). So all in all, was this a horrible dining experience? Surprisingly not. Although the waiter was a scatter brain that didn't really care, he was happy as a clam. The kids ate up the meat & cheeses plate and were happy with the gelato on the way back to our hotel. And we were in the mood to have a good time.",
