    "Just finished a nice late night meal at El Atril. We arrived near closing time but the staff was kind enough to accommodate us.Ordered the chorizo, shishito peppers, Cajun eggplant with cheesy polenta, and.... kangaroo steak!? That last was a first (not an oxymoron). Interesting flavor, a bit gamey, but not all that different from beef.But now I feel a bit guilty about eating the image in my head: a kangaroo wearing boxing gloves with a baby kangaroo in the pouch. Ah well... (Chomp, chomp, chomp)",
