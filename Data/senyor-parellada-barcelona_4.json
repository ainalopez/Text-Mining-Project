    "This place rocks!!!... I read \u00a0few reviews before making reservation, I came in with my own bottle of water, no order bread, my waitress even advised me not to order too much & my bill came out so reasonable. \u00a0The dishes are outstanding, fresh seafood, the duck was sooo good. \u00a0I am coming back for 2nd time to complete my wished list. \u00a0So study its menu, prepare yourself, set your expectation, win-win for both sides. \u00a0Service excellent, outstanding foods!!!....",
