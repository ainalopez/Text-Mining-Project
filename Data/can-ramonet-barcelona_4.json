    "The food was very good. \u00a0I had the roasted vegetables with goat cheese appetizer. \u00a0The flavors were varied and it tasted delicious. I also had the vegetable paella which was also very good The baked sea bass was amazing. \u00a0It so well seasoned and the potatoes on top seemed to be baked with it in all the wonderful seasonings.I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Spain. \u00a0The catalan creme Brulee was not warm. \u00a0It tasted okay. \u00a0I wouldn't order the brulee again. \u00a0If it weren't for the long wait to be acknowledged and seated the second time I was there, \u00a0even though there were plenty of empty chairs, they would have received five stars.",
