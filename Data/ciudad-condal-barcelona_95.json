    "My only complaint which is minor is it took a bit to get a seat for 5. \u00a0Once we did the food was delicious. \u00a0We had grilled scallions, which were delicious (peel them first), octopus, tuna, a ham and mushroom dish but our favorites were the peeled shrimp, mini hamburger and a cured ham sandwich with a little truffle oil, \u00a0this seemed to be the group favorite. \u00a0The desserts were equally fantastic. \u00a0 So far the best meal I've had in my several visits to Barcelona!",
