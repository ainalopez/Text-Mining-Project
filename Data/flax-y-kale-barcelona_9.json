    "Flax & Kale is a wonderful place to grab a healthy meal. I've been pleased with every meals I've gotten there, and their juices are pretty good, but expensive. I recommend the Virus Killer if you're feeling a little under the weather. The Green Slim juice is very heavy on the spinach taste, and the Horchita juice makes a great dessert. The grilled watermelon is a fun starter! The food is wonderful, but the staff isn't particularly nice. I've had to wait very long on more than one occasion to even put in an order. On the bright side, it's only a matter of minutes once you order for your food to come out!",
