    "delightful, spacious modern European restaurant on the ground floor of trendy Hotel Omm. deservedly scoring a Michelin star, this ambitious joint puts together a selection of sophisticated tasting menus, including an optional matched wine selection, featuring some great ingredients and taste combinations. the setting is a good balance of buzz and space, allowing uninterrupted conversation with dining companions. service was decent (better if you speak Spanish!) and the initial introduction of courses from the wait staff ceased about half way through the service, leaving us to speculate on the latest concoction delivered. wine selection good, though a little on the expensive side. the mushroom with fois gras and sugar apple and candy floss were highlight courses. overall, definitely worth a visit, but better on expense account, since you can easily go EUR150 a person (hence my 4 rating rather than 5 for value).",
