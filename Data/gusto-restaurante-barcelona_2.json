    "We liked this restaurant so much we ate dinner there twice in a matter of days while staying down the street in Barcelona.I know I've mentioned this a couple times, but I'm not cut out for tapas. \u00a0I don't want to order a bunch of small bites when I can just order once and enjoy my meal without looking at the menu again or flagging down a waiter.Food: \u00a05 StarsEverything we ordered on two separate occasions were delicious from the pizza, bruschetta, tiramisu etc. \u00a0I didn't take photos the second time we went for dinner because we took some family there who were visiting from \u00a0Lisbon, Portugal. \u00a0I think they liked it too. \u00a0Service: \u00a04 StarsThe service was great both times we were there, but the waiter kept knocking my jacket off my chair the second time we went for dinner. \u00a0The tables are so close that it doesn't allow room to walk between them when people are seated. \u00a0That was a little annoying because I had to pick my leather jacket up off the floor.Atmosphere: \u00a04 StarsIt's nice inside, but the tables are a little close together hence my problem above with my jacket getting knocked off. \u00a0Maybe they need some kind of coat rack to alleviate the problem. \u00a0Recommendation:We would definitely go back again because the food is excellent.",
