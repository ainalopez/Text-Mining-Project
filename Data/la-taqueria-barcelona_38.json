    "If you like mexican, here'a a nice authentic \"street-like\" food restaurant. It's located on a side street off the main drag, yet close to Sangrada Familia. (We stopped here for lunch after touring Sangrada Familia). It's a small, brightly decorated restaurant with friendly (and English speaking) staff. The menu is in English as well. The tacos were delicious! Food is served in smaller portion sizes (than compared to US mexican restaurants, but was a sufficient amount of food). We had the guacamole for starters (shared with 3 people) and each ordered tacos (pastor and chicken). Both tacos were excellent and the guac was tasty too! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.Seemed a bit on the pricier side (but in Barcelona, probably cheap given the price of things).",
