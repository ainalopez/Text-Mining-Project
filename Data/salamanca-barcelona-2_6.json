    "Excellent Spanish restaurant. Popular for Spaniards, fresh paellas, not unfrozen ones like in the Ramblas. My wife and me ate a superb arroz negro, drank a great Albari\u00f1o wine for just 55\u20ac. We got some free starters. A bit noisy, but that's how Spanish like it. Waiters always around, be straight to them.., especially with the few Spanish ones (most are Latinos or Pakistanis)But the best part to recommend is the ham from Salamanca, the best akorn ham in Spain. That's why the restaurant is called Salamanca, because the owner, se\u00f1or Silvestre comes from that Castilian province and ensures that the ham is the real one. So as a starter ask a bandeja of Salamanca or Guijuelo ham, and drink it with any wine not necessarily red, you can try a white Albari\u00f1o or a red from Ribera del Duero, you will not regret it.Qu\u00e9 aproveche!",
