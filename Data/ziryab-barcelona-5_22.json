    "This is a charming small hole in the wall bar. Hard to find. Serves cocktails, wine, beer, and hookahs. New ownership since last August. The new owners are very interesting. You have to find out for yourself. Very lovely and accommodating people. They will do anything to make you happy. Good hookahs, good music, and fantastic mojitos. Ask Emlin (hope I didn't butcher his name) to make them. Really nice experience if you're looking for a hidden gem off the beaten path",
