    "This may just be my favorite beer bar in Barcelona. Every time I go, there is an awesome selection of beers on tap I have never seen before, ranging from light to dark, weak to strong, from all over the world. The only food I've tried so far were the croquetas, which were totally unique and unlike any other croqueta I've ever had. The beer prices are pretty steep, ranging between \u20ac5-8 for a pint, but that's pretty typical for anything beyond the standard beer in Barcelona. I agree with the other reviewer that they are often poured poorly, with far too much head, and when you pay \u20ac8 for a beer you certainly don't want 1/5 of that to be foam.",
