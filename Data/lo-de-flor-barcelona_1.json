    "Our experience at Lo de Flor was everything you could hope for in a quaint European dinner and is the stuff of stories. We had tried another restaurant that night, but they were full. The owner of the restaurant told us to try Lo de Flor. We got rough directions (take a left and left and right...) and stumbled on this hidden gem. It was very quiet that night and we were seated right away.Our waitress was amazing and talked us through not just the menu, but several \"off the menu\" items that were being offered that night. The gazpacho was one of the freshest and flavorful I've ever had. The Straciatella (a young mozzarella with tomatoes and toast) is a must! We also both got the tartare which was fresh and delicious. The wine recommendation was amazing (although I'm not sure there is bad wine in Barcelona...)This place is just an absolute must. It's a bit off the beaten path, but worth hunting for.",
