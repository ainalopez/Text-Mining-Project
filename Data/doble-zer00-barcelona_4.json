    "first of all, this was probably the hardest venue to ever find. EVER. \u00a0it's tucked away in this neighborhood + even the local shopkeepers don't know where it's at when we asked for directions (though their own shops were a couple blocks away). \u00a0once you find it, you're thinking, \"did i just step into a rock'n'roll bar?\"the decor leans toward a trying-too-hard-to-be-a-punkhead-music-bar type. \u00a0black lacquer stools, tables, counters. \u00a0the art work showcased on the walls are not my style, but impressive: \u00a0globs of white paint that haphazardly form punk music figures smoking a cigarettes or playing a guitar on black backgrounds.we came for dinner around 8pm ('early' in barcelona standards) + perused the english menu that doesn't translate everything that's served in the restaurant. \u00a0the fare is predominantly sushi + asian cuisine. \u00a0or a hybrid of both. \u00a0we had the luna maki, sake maki + yakitori (that's skewered chicken for husband since i don't eat meat). \u00a0the edamame was a bit brown in color + cold. \u00a0very little sea salt on it + no bowl provided to place the emptied shells. \u00a0the maki rolls were just 'eh' + no available 'low sodium' soy sauce in the house. \u00a0the lifesaver of the meal (warranting a 3-star review versus the 2-star i would've given) was the yakimeshi: \u00a0this place's version of asian fried rice...the absolutely BEST fried rice (regardless the cuisine) we both have ever tasted + ate. \u00a0handsdown!! \u00a0eversince we got back stateside, i've tried to mimic this fried rice in my own kitchen + can't seem to master it. \u00a0i'd go back here just to try the yakimeshi again + get 'clues' as to what the ingredients are.other than this fabulous dish, i'd definitely go elsewhere for better sushi in general. \u00a0with barcelona being a port, there must be better sushi places out there.",
