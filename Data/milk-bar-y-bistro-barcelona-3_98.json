    "If you're looking for the American brunch experience while in Barcelona, this place comes close. Even better, you can get it any day of the week (serving M-F in addition to the weekends!)Besides the fact that everyone around us was clearly from across the ocean, and the music was one of 60s/70s/80s Americana, the food also pins down dishes that make breakfast so \"epic\" - plates of bloated pancakes brightened by fresh berries and powdered sugar, eggs smothered in hollandaise with a heap of home fries, crusty french toast, mountainous bowls of granola. All these classic dishes were done in exactly that way - simple and straightforward. Not much to write home about, but enticing for people who might be looking for a change up from the simple pastry and cappuccino combo on a more typical morning.",
