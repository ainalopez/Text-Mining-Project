    "I came to Barcelona for a visit in December 2013, and Etapes was highly recommended by our hotel concierge as a must try in Barcelona. Since the restaurant is small, I highly recommend making reservations for this amazing restaurant as you do not want to miss out on this delicious cuisine. For our meal we ordered the:- Foie Gras - delicious and the texture was amazing- Cannelloni App - the cheese was melted perfectly, and the whole appetizer tied together so well with flavor and was delicious- Bread with Tomato- Seafood Paella - definitely recommend, we ordered for serving of 4 people and it came out in a huge pan before it was served individually. - Crema Catalana - delicious and a great way to end a fantastic meal- Tiramisu - didn't get to tryEverything was absolutely delicious and the presentation of every course was so gorgeous that I almost didn't even want to eat it! The servers were so knowledgeable on the wine and offered great recommendations on wine pairings for our meal. This was such a great experience at Etapes and I would highly recommend coming here if you're in Barcelona. The meal was so affordable based on the quality of the meal, and I agree with the hotel concierge that this place deserves a Michelin star!",
