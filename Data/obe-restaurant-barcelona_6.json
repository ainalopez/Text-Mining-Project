    "Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The service started a bit slow, and it took a bit too long to get the menu and first order, but then it turned. The food was authentic Italian and very good. The chef and the waiter were really nice, especially towards our 4 year old daughter, which is always very nice. Overall a good experience.",
