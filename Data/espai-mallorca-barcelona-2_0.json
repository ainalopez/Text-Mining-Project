    "Skip all of those terrible, overpriced restaurants in Barcelona that serve you reheated garbage (you know, the ones whose menus have pictures and entries in multiple languages) and come here. \u00a0Espai Mallorca will give you a delicious breakfast for under 3\u20ac and an equally delicious late night dinner to make up for the horrible food you ate elsewhere. \u00a0The ensa\u00efmadas (Mallorcan pastry) are light, fluffy, and go well with a cafe con leche for breakfast, and all bread is clearly not made in an industrial oven somewhere. \u00a0The menu itself is all in Catal\u00e0 (Catalan) but the staff also speaks Castilian Spanish and can easily answer any questions you have. \u00a0Sept-June the bar hosts lots of cultural events every week, so check out their schedule.",
