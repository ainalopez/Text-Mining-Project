    "We LOVED Cera 23. I believe some other reviewers have said that the place is touristy, but we did not feel that way (even though, yes, we were tourists). Almost every other party the evening we were there were locals.We began with some cava (one free glass thanks to a Yelp check-in deal), then had cocktails and then wine. The blackberry mojito was very good, although a bit sweet. We had the tuna tartar and pulpo for appetizers. The octopus was excellent, if not a little salty-- but we still loved it. The tuna was outstanding and our favorite of the two. For our main course we had the beef cheek and the black rice. The beef cheek was the star of the night... incredibly tender and flavorful. The black rice was good, but paled in comparison to the beef. To be fair, the waiter recommended a few other entrees (including the beef) but I got the black rice anyways. Even more impressive than the food was the service and atmosphere. We had 3 different servers helping each other, all of them extremely welcoming, friendly, and helpful. All in all, we couldn't have asked for a better night and we were so happy we ate at Cera 23.",
