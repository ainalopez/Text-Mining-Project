    "The unique interior and giant mushrooms make this worth the walk or can ride to have a bite here. Very kid friendly and cozy. Great cappuccino, nice selection of sweets and healthy options too. I had the Pudding salad which was excellent! Pudding is an excellent choice for brunch, lunch or afternoon snack.",
