    "Went to this restaurant with my vegetarian friend and we both really liked it! We offered the Brie cheese salad as a starter (which I would highly recommend) and I got the pappardelle for dinner. She got a eggplant dish that was similar to a lasagna, which she really enjoyed. The atmosphere was the best part - the place was beautiful, the menu very artsy, and if you make a reservation they have a name placard on your table. Also the fresh juices are delicious, and although expensive (about 5\u20ac) and really good!",
