    "The navajas (razor clams) that I had here were life-changing. \u00a0Simply-prepared, straight from the tin, with a drizzle of fruity olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. \u00a0I went to El Corte Ingles afterwards and bought 5 tins of these little bottom-feeders to smuggle home, and although they are delicious, the ones I had at El Xampanyet were probably from a premium shellfish canner. \u00a0Or it could have been the awesome ambiance. \u00a0Or the delicious house cava. \u00a0Get the asparagus too.Line up at least 20 minutes before opening time at dinner...don't worry if you're the first ones, it'll start piling up quick. \u00a0Go in there ready to point (if no habla espanol) and eat. \u00a0It's aaallll delicious. Seriously, there are moments I'm really exasperated by my fellow Americans...\"Umm, que es that? \u00a0Oh, ewww, sweetie, I think that's GOAT cheese.\" Stop embarrassing us by y'all just staying home...",
