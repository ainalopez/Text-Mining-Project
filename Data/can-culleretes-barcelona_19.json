    "Impressive food and service. Could have been a tourist trap... Authentic cuisine and genuine hospitality combined to make a classic experience. Gambas al ajillo, croquetas, jamon, catalan wine, delicious suckling pig with a snappy crunchy skin and velvety flavorful meat. Whole sole with classic almond sauce. Should have hit the desserts, but we had just gotten in and were fried from travel.When compared to other \"oldest restaurants\" Can Culleretes is a real winner.",
