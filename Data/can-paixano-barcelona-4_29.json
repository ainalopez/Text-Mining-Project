    "Ohhh Can Paixano. Definitely one of the highlights of our time in Barcelona.Given that we were traveling on a budget, we sought out CP as a place billed for a frugal, fun time. Cheap tapas and sparkling? Count us in. We arrived around 1900 to a pretty full house. As far as I could see, CP is standing room only. Which is fine, it helped facilitate more conversation and there are far too many people wanting to come in than sitting room would allow.For starters: the cava. OHHHHHHHHH the cava. Bottles of it. Brut, dry, rose...whatever you like! I don't think any bottle is more than 6 euro. See ya later. They are quick to serve, too. Obviously the stuff isn't top shelf, but it is private label with CP and perfectly fine at the price point. The tapas were needed with all the cava. Haha. I would say they ranged from good to ok. Sausage was definitely stronger than more cheese oriented options. Each of these dishes hovered around 3 euro so more than adequate taste and quantity for what amounted to a safety snack. Again. Cava.We met a very friendly Aussie (redundant?) who works in IT in Barcelona. Had a great conversation as we were some of the new native english speakers. The vibe of the place encourages that kind of connection, though. I imagine this is a great launching point to a night of drinks and/or clubs. While it is tucked away in an alley, the internet can be a blessing.Eat here. More importantly, drink here. You'll be glad you did.",
