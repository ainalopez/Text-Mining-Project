    "The best doner kebab in BCN. I spent a summer in BCN in 2008 and ate here all the time. Came back a couple months ago and was happy to find that the place is every bit as good as I remember it being.It's important to point out that these doners are Pakistani-style, which means the chicken tastes like tandoori chicken and instead of pita bread, they use freshly baked naan. Personally, I much prefer this style to the Turkish style.It's also a great deal and the guys who work there are super friendly.",
