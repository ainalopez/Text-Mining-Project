    "This was my second time at Pakta. When my boyfriend and I went last summer--only several months after it opened--I was blown away. The space is beautiful, intimate and playful with a rainbow loom on the ceiling and walls. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious and creative. Because our experience was so great, we decided to return this summer during a short stop over in Barcelona. While the food was still delicious, something felt different. \u00a0The service was more rushed and impersonal and it felt like they were just churning us out to get to the next seating. \u00a0During our first visit we thought the policy of having to ask to go to the bathroom was cute and quirky. This time it was just annoying.During this trip we also went to Hoja Santa, another newer restaurant by the same owners. I had a similar feeling from Hoja Santa that I did from Pakta a year ago. So maybe now that Pakta is a hot spot it just has lost that special personal touch. Or maybe it was just an off night. I'm hoping it was the latter....",
