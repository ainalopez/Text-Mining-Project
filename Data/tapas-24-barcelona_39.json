    "I heard about this restaurant from Rick Steve's (his Spain guide book!) and it mentioned that this place had some unique and scrumptious tapas. Well, here we are! We walked inside, down some steps, and sat ourselves at the bar area. Proceeded to order a couple tapas from the short menu.(1) Bikini commerc - this was a ham sandwich with cheese, nothing too exciting / kinda salty and oily!(2) McFoie Gras burger - we wanted to try this burger, but it was so tiny and a bit underwhelming!(3) Potato ball with spicy beef - yes, this was great; we recommend it! the potato ball was quite big and I kinda wish I ordered another one. :)Overall, this tapas bar is relaxed and staff are friendly (although slow service!). I'm happy with the purchases, although I'm wondering if other places have better / wider selection?! It's located along a busy area of town.",
