    "It's entirely possible that I just did not order the right things (the right things seem to be the patatas bravas and baby squid dishes) but I thought that Quim was just ok in taste and too expensive in price. \u00a0And the couple next to me may or may not have found a piece of glass in one of their dishes..Ordered a truita of the day (todays omelette-pie featured onions) and pulpitos. \u00a0The onions in the truita were nicely sweated and the truita itself tender. \u00a0The pulpitos (baby octopus), \u20ac14, came 4 to a plate, saut\u00e9ed/braised with caramelized onions. \u00a0Just a bit too chewy and the onions overly salty. \u00a0In general the various seafood plates are modest in size and will run you \u20ac12-20 each.On the plus side, it was kind of fun to sit and eat right amidst the hustle and bustle of La Boquer\u00eda!",
