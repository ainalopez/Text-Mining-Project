    "Ate here for a late lunch, having heard about the salads from one of the other reviewers. \u00a0I had a pretty big salad with chicken (my wife would be proud) and a couple of large beers (since the salad would offset the beers). \u00a0Total cost was ~13 Euros - I thought it was a good value. \u00a0There were not many people in the place at that time, and I sat at the bar, so the service was really quick. \u00a0The salad was great, the beer was typical Western European beer, but I would definitely come back.Contrary to what the business detail says, they did have outdoor seating. \u00a0Not much of a view, but there were ~ 6-8 tables and is on a comparatively quiet street. \u00a0It rained today, so I sat inside. \u00a0I think there is no smoking inside, but outside it is probably allowed.Good location right near the Hotel Barcelona Center, and all (most) credit cards were accepted. \u00a0I'd definitely come if you're in the mood for a good salad.",
