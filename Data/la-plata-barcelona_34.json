    "When I travel to Spain, I'm always willing to try off-the-beaten-path restos. \u00a099.9999% of the spots in Barcelona are so much better than any/all of the tapas restos in the US.Fact.I looooooove sardines and anchovies with onions. This spot has one of the freshest and tastiest anchovies and sardines in Barcelona.Give me small plates of savory fish and Estrella Damm beer...and I'm home.",
