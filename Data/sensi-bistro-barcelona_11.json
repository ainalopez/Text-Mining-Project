    "My 2nd favorite tapas place in Barcelona! The staff is awesome and super chill. The prices on the food are good and they crank the AC, which is great for hot nights! A little hard to find but totally worth the effort.The bravas are good and if they still have the zucchini and goat cheese with honey you should definitely try it! Also free bread!",
