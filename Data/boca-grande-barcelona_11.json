    "Big disappointment. \u00a0We told the waitress my wife could not have tomato. \u00a0She ordered the Old Lettuces salad, and it was full of tomatoes (no mention of the tomatoes on the menu). I ordered the Ox steak. \u00a0The accompanying sauce was not served until after I had finished the steak. \u00a0My wife ordered Soupy Rice with Big Prawns and Clams. \u00a0Well, the rice was soupy, but there were chunks of seafood (not mentioned), one clam, one prawn body with no meat in it, one shrimp (not mentioned), and mussels (not mentioned in the menu). \u00a0And one of the mussels had not opened which could have contaminated the dish. \u00a0When we brought this to the waitress's attention, she denied there was a problem, and that we would have to pay for an extra prawn -- the one she should have received -- if she wanted it. \u00a0The waitress never showed herself again even though we asked to see her two more times.",
