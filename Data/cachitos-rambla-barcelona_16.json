    "Enjoyable outdoor cafe dining good for people watching and reading or social get togethers. The waiter let me taste the rose first, and it was dry and delicious. They were out of artichoke shavings so I could not have artichoke shavings with egg. But I settled for two tapas: patatas and aubergine with goat cheese and molasses. Both were very good but the latter was especially delicious--aubergine is eggplant, which was sliced very thin and lightly fried.",
