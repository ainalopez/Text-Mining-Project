    "The only reason we chose this sit down bars inside the market was because we saw sangrias for \u20ac2,50! While the prices were beverages seem cheap....they make up for it with the price of the food items. After standing alongside the bar waiting for someone to finish their meal so we can snatched up their seats, we finally sat down and ordered ourselves some sangria and shared the catalonia sausage plate for \u20ac8,50. The sangria wasn't bad...wish it was a bigger glass though. The sausage plate took forever to prepare. It comes with grilled peppers, fries and bread drizzled with oil and vinegar. The food is just ok for me...you come to the market and dine here for the experience but I definitely wouldn't spend much here. You can get a big empanada or potato cake next door for \u20ac2,50 and feel more satisfied. The lady next to us had the salmon plate and she returned her fish back to the kitchen 2 or 3 times because it was raw in the middle. I mean, how hard is it to cook salmon all the way through? At least the server was nice enough to assist her without any attitudes.",
