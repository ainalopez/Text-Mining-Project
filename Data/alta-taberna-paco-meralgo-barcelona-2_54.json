    "Loved loved loved it. \u00a0Absolutely fantastic food. \u00a0Friendly waitstaff. \u00a0We have been eating all over Barcelona at a lot of different highly recommended places and the food here was some of the absolutely very best we had. \u00a0This place is not cheap but the quality of the food and the cooking makes it worth every dime. \u00a0Order the papas bravas - easily the very best I have had anywhere in Spain - and the Sepietas salteadas en su tinta.",
