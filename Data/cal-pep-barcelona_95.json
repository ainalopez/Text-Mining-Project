    "Ah, Cal Pep, Cal Pep! The mother of all tapas bars, the true original. Well, not quite. Barcelona, being the Catalan capital and having a distinct and completely different gastronomic tradition to other regions of Spain, is not the origin of tapas or the best place to find or eat them. That would be Seville in Andalusia and San Sebasti\u00e1n in the Basque Country. And possibly Madrid. But Cal Pep is world famous, even, rather incongruously, appearing at no. 31 in the 2005 San Pellegrino World's Best Restaurants awards and winning the award for Outstanding Value, and also at no. 66 in 2007. Its fame is so widespread that people queue outside for however long it takes to get a place at the bar. Celebrities, famous chefs and critics the world over mention Cal Pep in hushed tones. The queue moves slowly along the back inside. From door to sit-down, at lunchtime, the wait is about an hour long. Perfectly reasaonable when you're about to have one of the world's finest and freshest seafood tapas experiences. Pep Manubens himself is always there, after three decades of hard work. The staff always smile and always help. Given the pressure, and the high number of non-local visitors who are excited and anxious, you'd think staff would be grumpy and surly, but the mood is cheeful. The speed with which dishes are made to order, and the industrial discipline of the kitchen are deeply impressive. Cal Pep is a Mecca for foodies for a simple reason: it's honest, fresh and simple. And it's not expensive. It has inspired legions of imitators, not least London's Barrafina. If you have one day to spend in Barcelona, this would be a perfect lunch option. An hour waiting? An hour well spent.",
