    "One of the things I miss the most about America is the plethora of \"fake meat,\" meaning good veg-burgers. \u00a0Most places in the States will make a Gardenburger along with the meat fare, but that trend hasn't reached here as of yet.Their burgers are crafted on-site and quite flavorful. \u00a0Strangely enough, I had been here for almost a year and only found it when a vegetarian chef friend visited from the UK and told me about it. (Now, we're all glad that Yelp is here so I can find more stuff like this!)The bar itself is quite fun and a great stop on the way to/from somewhere. \u00a0Everyone can eat there and even the most die hard carnivores enjoy the food.",
