    "The view from the restaurant is amazing. The food is so-so. Had the Pan Con Tomate which was served cold and soggy. Hubby had some chicken, walnut salad something. The salad seemed like it was from a package mix and parts of it had gone bad and were a little slimy. We didn't complain (which we should have) but the waiter also didn't comment on the fact that only 3 or 4 bites were taken. I expected he would ask if it was ok since the majority of it was still in the bowl when he took it away.",
