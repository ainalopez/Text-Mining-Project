    "When I went to a paella cooking class the chef who cooked for us said Salamanca had the best paella on the broa walk. So I wanted to try it since I was hitting the broad walk the next day. It was the last restaurant on the broad walk side (not pier). There's plenty of outdoor seating and hey have 1-2 waiter that speaks English. Damn the menu is an expensive one! I guess it's pretty fancy. Everything was over 20 euros! Eek! But I saw the seafood paella and it was 16 euros. I got it and boy it was really good! I loved how they put big chunks of calamari in it! The seafood was fresh and everything was great! The bread with deli meat tapa style was good too! Service was actually decent too! They came by and asked you if you liked it and check up on you. I gave a tip, wasn't sure if I had to or not?",
