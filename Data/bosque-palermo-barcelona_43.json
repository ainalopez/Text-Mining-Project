    "Lovely small restaurant in Barcelona downtown. It is located a bit aside the main streets so in the evening it is rather quiet around.The gazpacho soup I had as a starter was really good. As a main I had a Paella which was tasty and just what I had imagined. The portion was rather big for a two person Paella for 20euros.All in all we had a dinner with classic barcelonean Atmosphere and pricely really good",
