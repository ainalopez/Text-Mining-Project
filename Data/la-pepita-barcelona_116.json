    "Nothing better than this Tapas restaurant. \u00a0 The hostess and bartender and the food was amazing.They gave us the best two bar seats and within. Minute the restaurant was packed and locals were waiting for seats. \u00a0Quite,the opposite from the previous night at a different restaurant when we had to wait 90 minutes while all the Spanish speaking patrons who came after us ere served. \u00a0Great wine, and all dishes were perfect. \u00a0No reason to name one dish as all were great. \u00a0Make this a definite stop.",
