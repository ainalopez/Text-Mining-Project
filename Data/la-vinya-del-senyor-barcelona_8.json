    "Very nice wine bar with select local wines and tapas around wine tasting. Carefully picked wines and ingredients worth every penny. Must go for wine lovers in Barcelona. Great place to just have a drink or meet friends and have a tapas dinner. Staff very nice and helpful. Crowd nice and trendy. Great location in the Born barrio.",
