    "I returned to N.A.P. last night to have an early dinner and enjoy one of my favorite foods: pizza! \u00a0Obviously, heading to this spot was a natural choice, and the food did not disappoint. \u00a0And while I had an absolutely delicious meal, the service, treatment, and atmosphere in the restaurant left much to be desired. \u00a0First, I arrived at the restaurant right at opening. \u00a0Already, the waitress was attending to a couple seated at an outside table, enjoying wine. \u00a0When asked if I could be seated, a waitress told me (just after serving the couple outside) that they were not open yet...Strange!Later, I was moved around the restaurant to make for more space, found that the waitstaff was disorganized and generally a bit elementary. \u00a0It seems like a rag tag crew with much disorder.I'll be back to NAP for their truly authentic pizzas, but I certainly won't look forward to their subpar service. \u00a0Something to keep in mind, particularly when you're looking for a calm, relaxing, or romantic dinner.",
