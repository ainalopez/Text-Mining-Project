    "There are a lot of \"touristy\" restaurants in Barcelona. I was initially skeptical of what we'd get here being so close to La Ramblas, but I was pleasantly surprised. We were seated right away in a great location looking out on Placa Real. We ordered the standard tourist fair since it was our first meal in Barcelona. Gazpacho, Paella, and Sangria. I was pleasantly surprised by all of it. While it wasn't the best meal we had during out time here, it was definitely better than all the pre-made paella you'll see being hocked on La Ramblas. People watching on Placa Real is also worth sitting down and drinking a Sangria with a loved one or friend. I'd recommend this place to any first time visitor to Barcelona who wants to sit and soak up some sun and Catalan vibes.",
