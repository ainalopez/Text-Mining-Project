    "Our bike tour guide recommended this brunch restaurant when we rode by. The fa\u00e7ade of the restaurant was delightful and there were many patrons at the restaurant even around 4pm. We made note of the restaurant and decided to visit the restaurant a couple days later when we needed a break from Spanish food. \u00a0This place is bustling during brunch (they don't take reservations) and there was a half hour wait when we arrived. When we sat down, our group agreed that the d\u00e9cor and menu reminded us of the charming bright New York West Village restaurants.I ordered the poached egg salad with strawberry brie toast on the side and took a bite of A's banana bread. Everything was extremely fresh and the portions were large. I enjoyed my food so much that I finished my entire spread even though I was stuffed half way through! The caf\u00e9 also makes some really great smoothies that you can enjoy along with your brunch.",
