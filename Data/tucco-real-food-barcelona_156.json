    "A gem of a restaurant that is a must try if you are in Barcelona. The pasta is hand made by expert hands and the combination of ingredients is just perfect. Hot bread arrives at the table quickly and the desserts are a perfect end to this wonderful meal. The service with a smile is very welcoming even for those that only speak English. Here you feel like you are coming home to family where your uncle is the expert chef.",
