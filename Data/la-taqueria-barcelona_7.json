    "First.... it does not matter if its true to tradition or not, the Tacos Al Pastor were good.Now, for what really disappointed me:Simply put, the guacamole had to have been store bought. The guacamole they serve has a \"fluffing\" agent (ingredient) which devastates the avocados. It truly sickens me when I find this type of \"guacamole\" in restaurants. Especially in a region where avocados seem to be so readily available (even Hass). I just find that there is no excuse for doing this and the starter really distracted from the excellent Tacos Al Pastor. It should also be noted that the chips are your typical (an not very good) store bought variety.I would also highly recommend making a reservation before going as they seemed to be nearly unable to accommodate those who did not have them.",
