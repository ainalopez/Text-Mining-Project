    "Make no mistake, this is a restaurant where the clientele is made up primarily of tourists. \u00a0But that doesn't mean that he food is not excellent and reasonably priced. \u00a0The menu is also rather creative, mixing Mediterranean and Asian dishes into a coherent Tapas. \u00a0We especially enjoyed the tuna tartare and the duck timbale. \u00a0Desserts were also good, but not the highlight of the evening.",
