    "The space is interesting and comfortable. Staff was pleasant.Food was acceptable, but ...- many rolls were pre-made, sitting waiting for orders- nothing was remotely Japanese; granted, it is a \"Brazilian\" sushi restaurant ... if you understand the distinction before going, you will probably be happy with the food.- my son ordered the Black Angus dish. \u00a0It was nearly inedible. This was the one unaccetable part of the meal. The dish was 19+ EUR.- the price is extremely high and the quality is only acceptable; in other words, the value is just not there.The wait staff also is clearly trained to push whatever the management wants to serve that night. I repeatedly asked about \"traditional Japanese\" options. And repeatedly our waiter suggested a roll that is deep-fried. I noted later that this particular rolls was being churned out of the kitchen even when orders were not in for it.If looking for a hip, loud (i.e., high energy) restaurant that has some tinge of Japanese cuisine, this is not a bad option.If you are looking for Japanese sushi (this is the first time that I have had to distinguish sushi), look elsewhere.",
