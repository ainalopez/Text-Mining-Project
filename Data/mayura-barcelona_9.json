    "1st of all, the address mentioned in yelp is inaccurate.2nd, the dining space is good, nice atmosphere with a little fountain in the middle surrounded by candles. Food is average or below average, I have been in many other places which have better taste with less price. I would come over here just in one case that I want some of Indian taste and I have been away for along time from my preferred restaurants. They do serve a big portion, and maybe this would explained the high price. WC is very dirty, used tissues all over place, wet floor.",
