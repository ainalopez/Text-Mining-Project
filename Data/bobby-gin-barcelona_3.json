    "I still wake up dreaming of this place, I loved it that much.I was fortunate enough to score a business trip to Barcelona for a conference. Myself and a couple of work buddies did a bit of research before making the journey to Spain and saw this place listed as one of the top spots for a good gintonic. And boy were they right!First up, and this is always key to a location like this, the staff was top notch. They were extremely knowledgable and friendly. We all left there knowing much more about gin, and the gintonic, by the end of the week. The bartenders, Markiel in particular, were very accommodating. We became regulars even though we were only there for a few nights.The vibe to the place is wonderful. The decor is fantastic, the music is a perfect blend of background music, and the focus is really on the cocktails and the conversation.They also do a good number of infusions, so if you want to step beyond a gintonic and see what they've been playing with lately you can do that too.If you're in the area this is a must visit.",
