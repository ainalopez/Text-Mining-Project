    "A great spot just off the Passeig de Born and near enough to the UPF Ciutadella campus to be a convenient place for takeaway. \u00a0I had a great salad and some vegetable curry fried rice for about eight euros fifty, a little pricey but it hit the spot. \u00a0Quick service, good food; take it down to the Ciutadella and grab a bench for a lovely lunch!",
