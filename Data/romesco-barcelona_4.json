    "Another tough find with the small alleys and storefronts beginning to look the same. However, when we did find it we were very pleased with the simple food prep and low prices. We ordered a salad to start and then two entrees as well as a wine to wash it all down. The prices can't be beat, but food is average at best. It's a cheap spot if you find it through the narrow streets, but don't go too far out of your way for this.",
