    "Finally! The type of ramen I've been dreaming of since I've been in Barcelona. Seriously. I almost gave up on ramen altogether after so much disappointment. We all had the spicy veggie broth - which was rich and creamy yet not thick or heavy. Of course I was the heretic at the table of vegetarians and had the egg and pork added to my toppings. I only wish the soup had come a little hotter. It was also the perfect sized bowl, and I was quite hungry! \u00a0The veggie gyozas were also quite tasty as we requested a second order. The place is quite small - it's a tight fit. I don't know if my friends had to wait long (I was late in arriving and they were already seated). \u00a0I will definitely be back! \u00a0And this is a true 5 star ramen review - like one I'd give in LA with my high expectations. (I sometimes grade on a scale for Barcelona). \u00a0Thanks Koku Kitchen - you scratched my ramen itch.",
