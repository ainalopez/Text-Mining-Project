    "Now simply Luzia, and no Chinese. But what remains is outstanding--hamburger, pasta with garlic shrimp, mozzarella salad, beef tenderloin, cheesecake (blueberry, not rasberry as listed) & lemon pie. Sangria is terrific, and the bar man shared his recipe. US$ 165 for 5 (2 people drinking). A bit slow on the service make it a 4 star, but not a big issue.",
