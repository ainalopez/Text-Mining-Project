    "Best tapas in town, hands down. My first giveaway that it was going to be good was that it was full of locals. The tapas bar is quite cozy and has a very inviting atmosphere. It's a very casual, no frills place. We asked for a wine list, they said \"red or white, that's the list,\" love it! We went on an ordering frenzy, from patatas bravas, to jamon serrano, ensalada rusa and croquetas. Everything was amazing, to the point where I was sad when I was too full to have more! Very authentic and fun to eat at, perfect tapas experience.",
