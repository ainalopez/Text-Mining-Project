    "Excellent meal, fantastic service, and lovely ambiance. We had a bunch of tapas (thumbs up for three orders of patatas bravas) and a bottle of wine. Everything we had was delicious and the prices are very reasonable. We didn't need to wait for a table but we didn't get there until 11pm on a Friday night. They do have English menus if needed.",
