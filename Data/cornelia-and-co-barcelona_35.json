    "My family dined here the night of our arrival in Barcelona. \u00a0We had just spent four nights and Paris, and I have to admit this dining experienced eclipsed any of our previous meals. \u00a0The staff was extremely accommodating and attentive, the food was delicious and our bill felt very reasonable. \u00a0Try the ch\u00e8vre salad with honey dressing - so good! \u00a0Overall a terrific value...will return during the trip.",
