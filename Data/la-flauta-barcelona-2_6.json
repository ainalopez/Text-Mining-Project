    "Came here for my first meal in Barcelona. Friend recommended to get here early. They open at 1pm so we go there and sat ourself. \u00a0Only one waiter spoke a lil bit of English so we had to wait for him. I guess he was busy with a larger table but he kept brushing is off. Eventually he came to our table and said in Spanish to let him finish with the other table first. I found it a bit pretentious especially with the fact we came and sat first on our table. I wasn't going to let them spoil our first meal in Barcelona...we eventually got him to help us and at that point you can tell he didn't want to. \u00a0My wife asked for his recommendation which was already a no no since he was not in the mood. \u00a0Food was decent. Don't get the pork, it's not good. The fried fish was good and their omelet was pretty big. I just wish our first eatery place in Barcelona wasn't so pretentious.",
