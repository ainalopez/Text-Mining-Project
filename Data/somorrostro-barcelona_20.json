    "Nice and cosy tapas bar with authentic and high-class food for a moderate pricing. The cook is using fresh and local ingredients. The meals cover a variety of high-quality fish, including unusual offerings such as moraine eel. The Chocolate ganache with sea salt and olive oil is amazing. The shrimps and Norwegian lobster are remarkable and intensively flavorful. The wine list offers good pairings. The place is offside the tourist tracks, but nevertheless close to La Barceloneta Beach.",
