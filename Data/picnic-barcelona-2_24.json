    "Another great recommendation from the Yelp community! \u00a0Somewhat isolated location for El Born but a great overall experience. Friendly staff, nice comfortable decor and the food was the best we have had so far. The fried green tomatoes and the scallops tapas were out of this world. We had the skirt steak and shrimp entrees. Both were devoured quickly. Wish we had this in our hometown. Felt like a neighborhood restaurant that is still a secret.",
