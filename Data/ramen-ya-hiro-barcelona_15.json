    "Before you decide to eat here, keep in mind that you will be waiting 1-2 hours before getting seated. Sounds crazy but this is actually pretty typical for ramen spot that's super good....and super small. That being said, arrive early (before 8:30p) and order some beers while you're in line to pass the time. Finally got seated after 2 hours of waiting, but I'm sure we would have been seated earlier if our group was smaller..we had 5 of us. We all ordered the Miso ramen (8.50\u20ac) with an extra egg(.50\u20ac)..I added extra seaweed on the side. It was a pretty solid bowl of ramen with tasty savory broth, a perfectly boiled&marinaded egg, and tender pork. Wish there was more noodles and that the noodles weren't as chewy..but for a ramen spot this good in Barcelona I can't really complain!If you are craving ramen and you happen to be in BCN, definitely try this place. Just don't come too starving or else you'll become hangry and the wait may disappoint you!",
