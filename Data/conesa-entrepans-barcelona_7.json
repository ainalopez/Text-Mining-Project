    "You know \u00a0the famous Iphone fans? They line up camping in front of the Apple store the previous day to buy the company's new device before it is sold out. You can see a similar group of people \u00a0especially in the afternoons in front of Conesa. It is a battle area but hey everyone wins in this game. You have to have a patience to stand for 30 minutes then score! \u00a0I usually get the best one: 'hamburgesa jardinera' \u00a0which is around 4 Euro. Stop by before 13.00 and after 16.00, I'd say.",
