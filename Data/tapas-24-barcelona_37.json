    "Mind blown. Great tapas and worth the 20 minute wait to eat.Recommendations:- bravas - basically fries with spicy sauce and mayonaise. The French couple next to us ordered this TWICE because it's that good.- bombes de la barceloneta - a potato with meat inside. order one per person!- bikini - a small sandwich with ham, black truffles, and mozzarella inside- McFoie Burger - a small beef hamburger with foie grasAlso check their chalkboard for specials. We also got some tacos which were fantastic.All of this for around 60 euros. Highly recommend!!!Note - service isn't great. I'd recommend knowing what you want and ordering in one go. Hard to flag down servers otherwise since they're incredibly busy. Also, make sure you don't lose a spot in line. I saw some folks get bypassed and didn't really speak up, lengthening their wait by 10 minutes.",
