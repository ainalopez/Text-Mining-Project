    "The experience here was pitiful. Dropped by for some takeout here and quickly realized that customers are a burden to the workers here. If you do not order right away they get a pissy attitude (nobody was behind us), and if you don't add high profit items (my wife only wanted one vegetable item), all courtesy goes out the door. The portions were large and the saigon sauce was too salty like the service, be prepared to drink a gallon of water after. There is much better food in the area for the price you pay. I blame myself for walking in here, please don't make the same mistake I did.",
