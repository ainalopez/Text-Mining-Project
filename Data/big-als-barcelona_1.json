    "Great place with big, American style/ sized burgers. Even small ones come with 2 beef patties. Small selection of their own micro-brewery beers. The staff are friendly and fun. The desserts change on a regular basis. If you have some big eaters in your group, this is the place to go. The even have a winners wall for those who finish the biggest of the burgers! We were fans of the one in Sitges and were excited when we found out one was opening in Barcelona.",
