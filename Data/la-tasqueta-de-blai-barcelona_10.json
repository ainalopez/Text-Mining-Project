    "We ate here a few times during our stay in Barcelona. The staff were all very friendly, spoke enough English for us to have no trouble ordering and the food was great! Most pintxos are 1 euro or a little more if they're fancier and I loved each one I tried! When you're done they count up your sticks to give you your bill. In the evening this place gets packed so get there earlier to ensure you get a spot. This place is a must visit if you're in the area and want some tasty food on a budget!",
