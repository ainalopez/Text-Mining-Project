    "A Tu Bola is a small and very cool tapas bar on carrer de l'hospital. It's menu is very small (this is a good thing), delicious and cheap (you can eat well for 6 euro). The idea is that you choose a type of meatball (or other types of balls, like sweet potato), and you then choose how to have it served - by itself, in a pita or on a bed of mashed potato. My girlfriend and I have been here twice in the past few days and we've had the beef meatballs and the chicken balls on pita. Both fantastic! (I'd recommend the pita option). The chocolate balls for dessert are a must! The owner is very friendly and works behind bar/kitchen herself. Hopefully we will return for a third time before we leave Barcelona.",
