    "This is the best tapas place I found during my 10-day stay in Barcelona. Loved how I just stumble upon this place in the middle of the Barrio Gotico. Hip place without being pretentious and more importantly the food is amazing and the staff is great! Here are the tapas to try:- Tomato \"millefeuille\"- Fresh truffle ravioli in parmesan cream- Duck timbale- Tuna tartare- Cheese and charcuterie plattersThey also have another restaurant 5 minutes away named Sensi Tapas with similar vibe and menu.",
