    "Really really didn't like this place. I don't want to say preying on tourists but...The food is extremely meh. Absolutely nothing special.The staff is overworked and stressed.Expensive in a way that just says that the people coming here are tourists.The location of this store really just seems so out of place in the neighborhood it's in. It feels out of place.I don't know, when you go to a place where everything looks so pretty and nothing has to do with the actual community... it's rough.",
