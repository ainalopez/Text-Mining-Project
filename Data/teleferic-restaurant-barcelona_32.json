    "A very hip spot that you can even enjoy by yourself. Foie gras with caremel onion is a great combination. the octopus with potato taste great too. I like the salmon and chopped asparagus but my wife think the combination is somehow strange. We like the small protion cause we can try everything but at the same time overall price is somehow the same. I would give 5 star if the price goes down a little a bet.",
