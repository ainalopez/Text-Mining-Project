    "Average restaurant, uncommitted staff... We asked the waiter what wine he could recommend and he just replied that he didn't drink wine. Small portion sizes - we had a three course meal with ham, paella and creme brul\u00e9 and had to order tapas in addition because we still were hungry. The tapas was pretty good though.",
