    "Dropped by with a friend to eat and study.Food: My friend LOVED her veggie panini and brownie with strawberry and orange/pineapple smoothie. I also enjoyed my hummus with veggies (4.5 euros). The hummus seemed homemade, it was really delicious and had raisins thrown on top. The portion was a little small for the price, but it's a bit expected considering it's a vegan establishment.The quinoa salad, veggie burgers, etc., that we saw being served to the other tables looked delicious!!!!!!Ambiance: Very cute, quaint, and cozy. There were only three tables (2 small and 1 big). You can also sit at the counter and watch the guy make the food and drinks. Decor was old school and the music was a perfect background.Service: Standard. He was prompt and matter-of-fact.I would come back to try more of the food. But definitely not to study! Too cramped haha.",
