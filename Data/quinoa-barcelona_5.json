    "Small vegetarian restaurant, \u00a0I had to seat at the bar since tables are reserved for parties of 2 or more. The menu is also small but has different selections of salads, quiche of the day and paninis. I tried their famous veggie burger with their citrus Zumo and it was an ideal lunch meal. All for only 7.90\u20ac. Def a healthy and affordable spot with friendly staff.",
