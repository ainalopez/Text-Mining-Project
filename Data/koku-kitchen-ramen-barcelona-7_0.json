    "I loved it! The ramen (\u20ac8.80) was excellent, and largely big enough. It comes with 2 slices of pork, an egg, and plenty of veggies (including spring onions) so you don't really have to pay for extras, the basic version is already delicious! There are 5 options for broth, including 1 or 2 vegetarian(s), so everyone can find something (s)he loves. I would advise you to try as well their homemade gyosas (\u20ac4) and their homemade lemonade, served in a cute mason jar (\u20ac2.5). All in all, you'll wait way less than at Ramen Ya-Hiro, and I enjoyed my food more here.",
