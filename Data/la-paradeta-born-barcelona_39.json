    "Quite possibly the best seafood I've ever had, and you have no idea how many seafood places I've eaten at. When you get inside, it's like you're at a seafood market with all the fish and clams and oysters etc set out in front of you. You tell them how you want them cooked, and in a fairly quick manner they call your order. The food is SO GOOD. No way to even stress how incredible it is. If you go to one seafood place in Barcelona, hell, in your life, go here. Cannot recommend it more. Freshest, most amazing experience with seafood yet.",
