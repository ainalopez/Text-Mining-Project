    "I feel four stars covers this bar appropriately. Being vegan and coming to Barcelona, I had to do a bit of research to find the spots where I could eat. After finding a place that serves vegan friendly burgers + craft beer, all boxes were ticked.My girlfriend (who is a meat eater) + I had a champion burger each with a side of chipped potatoes. I chose an Austrian IPA + my girlfriend had a cider. The burger was huge in a lovely bun, a smokey flavour and filling. The potatoes were insane- super soft + very hot (straight from the oven)! Only two things really bothered us on this visit:- 1) no condiments were offered with our meal. It would have been great to add hot sauce or extra veganaise to our burgers! Particularly needed sauce for those potatoes- we ate them dry. Would've been much better with something to dip them in! 2) tiny saucer plates for the burgers + no napkins! I'm sorry, but burgers that big with no cutlery, no plate space or napkins is not good! These guys definitely need to simply provide a bigger plate, napkins, cutlery (to clean up burger spillage for reconsumption!) and tasty condiments.Other than those points, delicious! Thanks guys!",
