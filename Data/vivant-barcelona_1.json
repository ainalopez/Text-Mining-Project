    "Went to dinner on recommendation from local wine merchant at La Vinicola (a very good place to bring a bottle home)Tapas and small plates were outstanding. Best pulpo we have had in many countries. Not chewy dusted with smoky paprika. \u00a0Excellent duck with a sweet sauce that did not overwhelm. Dinner for 5 with wine and 3 desserts was 90 Euros.",
