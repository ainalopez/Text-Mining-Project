    "Not a full 5, but higher then 4.5. The only issue with me was the under fried calamari, which I guess isn't a terrible thing for me. 9:00PM Tuesday night in July:Overall this place was magnificent. From the moment my girlfriend and I got there, we could see the hordes of people waiting to be fed. There was a significant line (~25 min wait) but definitely worth it. We ordered:CalamariMonk fish (grilled)Razor clamsMusselsTwo langoustine Gamba shrimpOystersSaladBeerGarlic sauceSalad came out of a box so be warned there. However it was refreshing to have with all that seafood. The calamari goes well with tobasco and the garlic sauce. The monkfish goes well with the garlic also, but I would probably want to get it fried next time instead of grilled. The shrimp were very good, but unfortunately priced so high :/. The mussels with tomatoe sauce were very good and a definite must; same with the razor clams! The langoustine were AMAZING. Tasted like buttered lobster that melted in your mouth. Obviously it's pricey because it's a rich people food, but I would recommend 1 or 2 just to try it. Beer was decent but super cheap. They sell wine only by the bottle but they're all 9-13 euros. Overall fresh seafood with a great menu, decently priced gives a near perfection rating.",
