    "I had a wonderful Spanish dinner here! I came in with a party for the 27 euro fixed price menu, and we embarked on a wonderful culinary journey. We enjoyed:1. Champagne2. Tapas:--Bread with fresh tomatoes and garlic--Meats & cheese--Potatoes with foie gras--Shrimp--Ham and mushroom croquettes3. Red wine4. Entrees - I chose pulpo (octopus)5. Sangria6. Dessert - creme brulee7. After dinner liqueurs!The quality of the food was excellent. I stuffed myself silly, and couldn't even finish the creme brulee! I especially loved the sangria, and the servers were friendly and helpful. The chef even came out to greet us!Thank you to 336 for taking great care of my flight crew. If you want a fantastic meal at a perfectly reasonable price, this is your destination. Reservations recommended.",
