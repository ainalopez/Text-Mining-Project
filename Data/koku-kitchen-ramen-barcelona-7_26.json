    "The service \u00a0and decor \u00a0was nice. \u00a0Price was affordable but the food was kind of disappointing. \u00a0The sunomono needed more vinegar \u00a0(su means vinegar in japanese) tasted too much of sesame oil and salt. The pork in the ramen was good but the noodles texture \u00a0not traditional and tasted like it wasn't \u00a0cooked enough, the soup was lacking \u00a0umami... \u00a0dumplings tasted store \u00a0bought. \u00a0It's an interpretation of japanese ramen but not the real thing.",
