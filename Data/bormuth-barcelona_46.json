    "It has three facades thanks to its location, and this quite good advantage is respected by a nice decoration. This place is cool. Nice and low ambient music. The place doesn't make you feel tired and you don't want to leave as you eat. You just want to sit, relax and keep chatting, drinking. The menu is a bit long and I am not a big fan of long menus, however the staff is friendly and they try to help you with your selection. The dishes are definitely delicious. Loved it.",
