    "Great casual atmosphere and really good contemporary Italian food. \u00a0Busy restaurant, so make sure you make a reservation. \u00a0Asparagus salad was to die for. \u00a0Other dishes were good too - pappardelle, pork shoulder, chicken. \u00a0The ingredients were fresh and local. \u00a0Our server did not speak English, but menu was available in English and easy to navigate. \u00a0Restaurant was a block off of La Rambla Catalunya and not touristy. \u00a0Had local feel.",
