    "Crowded, a bit dicey, no plates or utencils, and $4.00 bottles of cava. My kind of joint! Cheap!I had this billed as a dive bar and that's what we got. Cheap drinks with and freakin' amazeballs \"BLT\" that soaks up the bubbles from the bottle of cava being handed out like candy. Oh yeah... did I say cheap?!Expect a crowd but a good crowd at that. You'll be bumping into people but the vibe is friendly and welcoming. Toss your trash on the ground like the locals do and you will fit right in. Oh yeah... did I say cheap?!My only regret about coming to this place is that I didn't come here sooner. I could have easily spent hours getting tipsy and eating one sandwich after another. Oh yeah... did I say cheap?!I will be back!",
