    "Although hard to find (signage is nothing more than a small red circular sticker saying its name with a glass in the middle on the window..we walked by a few times while looking for this place), it is very throwback & in a great area; the owner clearly keeps things old school..serving food and really great cava which is both super cheap & delicious; not to mention, he pours til the very brim of your little glass..thus making it even more worth your buck (euro). It would be nice if there were places to sit and some kind of warning sign when leaving the place (my friend fell down upon exiting because the step is subtle and very easy to miss...and this was after just one glass of cava!) if looking to try Cava (red &/or white), like we were, I think is this is a great very charming place near Barceloneta to check out!",
