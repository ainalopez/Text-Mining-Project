    "The bombas from la bombeta was one of my favorite meals in Spain while I lived there this past summer . Upon arrival you realize quickly this isn't a touristy trap restaurant that's wildly overpriced like most of places near the beach . This place has no wifi , no English speakers , and nothing luxurious . What it does have is great food and prices . I would recommend it to anyone . Be prepared to speak a little Spanish though",
