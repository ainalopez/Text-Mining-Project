    "A cute, fun, and dare I say hip little place to grab a jug of sangria and some pintxos. Lots of younger clientele there, but there was also a large family that stopped by - so I guess the crowd was pretty mixed. I liked the sangria - it was light with plenty of fruits, and the pintxos themselves were delicious. As someone who's used to the US where they dump cheese in everything, I was really happy that this wasn't the case here. They had mini burrito-like pintxos and shrimp on mini \"pancakes\". The little churros were amazing because they were filled with warm chocolate on the inside, and had flavored chocolate shavings were a nice treat. Would 100% recommend.",
