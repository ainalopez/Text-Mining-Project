    "Reservations ahead of time is recommended. \u00a0I have stayed at Hotel ME several times before and was unable to get a table until my last visit. The food is amazing, unique, and I suggest going with the chef's recommended tasting menu because you get to experience so much of their various fares. \u00a0I believe we had about 12 different dishes including the pre-dessert before the dessert. Each dish is presented very artfully in unique bowls and plates, and the service is top notch. \u00a0Which can be a challenge finding good, prompt service in most of the places I've eaten at throughout Europe. \u00a0Aside from the amazing food, and just when you think your palate has had enough of unique and enjoyable flavors, they deliver a leather box similar to a jewelry box. \u00a0When you open it, it holds a piece of artfully designed and incredibly tasting chocolate.Definitely a must go to if you are looking for a special fine, intimate, dining experience in Barcelona.",
