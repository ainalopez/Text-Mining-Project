    "Rude service, Some of the food was ok but half of our food never came and when we asked for it she said you didn't order that. Then she brought a dish we didn't order (lamb when we ordered beef) and we said we didn't order this and she said yes you did and walked away. Never came and asked if we liked anything, or was everything ok. She was rolling silverware and completely ignoring us. It was insanely bad all around. We are American but my husband speaks fluent Spanish and ordered everything for us. No reason to treat customers this way. Will never, ever return. Sad this establishment would have a person like this working and treating people so badly.",
