    "Reviews don't lie. Great little place tucked away in a corner near Montjuic. I was so so so happy to find it after a disappointing day. The guys working were plain adorable and it seemed like everyone in the neighborhood stopped by to say hello. There were a few people studying or working inside which made me feel welcome as a solo sitter. I had a friendly conversation with a few other guests and ate a delicious banana cake. Would love, love, love for this place to exist a few thousand miles closer....",
