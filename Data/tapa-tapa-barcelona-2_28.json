    "Tapa Tapa is a chain and this review is of my experience at the Passeig de Gracia location. The only upside of this restaurant was that they had an English translation of their menu, which should have clearly indicated it's status as a \"tourist trap.\" The food was just over-priced and greasy and the Sangria was nothing to brag about either. NON-AUTHENTIC LOCAL EXPERIENCE ALERT!",
