    "Great place to have lunch or dinner. Good food and very close to the Ramblas Catalunya. Great ambiance and you can also buy cuts of meat, breads and fruit they use on their menu. I've been traveling for three months around Europe and this food is amongst the best I've had all trip. I ordered the chicken club and as a courtesy the gave me a tuna starter. It was delicious!!Instagram @faithmariCurator @visitsacramento",
