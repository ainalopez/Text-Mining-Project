    "Definitely the place to go for seafood in Barcelona, everything was so fresh and good. \u00a0Get the razor clams if available and the cold crab! \u00a0Highly recommend the cold whole crab and the prawns. \u00a0Don't get the huge prawns with lobster like claws though, not worth it nor does it taste that great. \u00a0Skip on the soup for sure.",
