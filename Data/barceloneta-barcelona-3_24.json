    "Eat here twice in 3 days. \u00a0 Tuna tartar was excellent. \u00a0Paella was also very good. \u00a0Make a reservation as they get crowded. \u00a0They are also one of the few restaurants to open earlier in the evening. Nice outdoor balcony. \u00a0 Restaurant \u00a0was very accommodating of gluten allergy",
