    "We went to Cera 23 and they claimed they were booked even though at 7:00 PM the place was empty. They lead us to Arume, which is a few doors down claiming they have the same menu. Both locations are owned by the same people according to the waiters but we come to find out the menus are totally different. We were hungry so we decided to stay. Be ware of the switch offer and I wished I would have left and tried Cera 23 \u00a0another night this time with a reservation. Service was ok and the menu was somewhat limited. Ordered king prawns \u00a0tempura style which was covered with a soggy batter as if it was not fully cooked. Had tuna for the main which was supposed to come with a spicy sauce. All we tasted was mayonnaise.",
