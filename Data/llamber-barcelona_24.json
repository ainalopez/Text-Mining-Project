    "Our hotel recommended Llamber for lunch. \u00a0It was one of the few places open around 3 p.m. for lunch. \u00a0Llamber is located near the El Born Culture Center in Barcelona. \u00a0We had the choice of eating in the bar or in the dining room and opted for the dining room.The restaurant is decorated in a rustic hipster posh decor. \u00a0We were provided with the English menus and it was recommended that we order the lunch menu for 15.50 euro. \u00a0They had a great selection of tapas, but we decided to go with the tapas menu because it provided the best deal.For starters, we had a carrot ginger soup. \u00a0It was served with a branzino toast. \u00a0The next course was a foie gras with rice. \u00a0The foie gras was in the sauce. \u00a0The next course was the fish and chips served in a cone. \u00a0The final course was a beef ravioli. \u00a0The pasta in the ravioli was very delicate.For our dessert, we were given the option of a local cottage cheese with honey or pears poached in wine. \u00a0We opted for the pears poached in wine and it was a great finish to the meal. The lunch special comes with wine, beer, coffee, or water. \u00a0Since we drank so much the night before, we stuck to wine. \u00a0Wine on the cocktail menu was reasonably priced and there were a lot of options sold by the glass.Overall, it was a great restaurant and fun for people watching.",
