    "La Plata only serves four tapas, and of course wine served in thimble sized glasses, a pour into your mouth carafe, or bottles. \u00a0The smelt here were delightful, small, crisp, hot and lightly salted. If it's the only tapa you eat in Barcelona, order this at La Plata! I ordered the anchovy on tomato bread drizzled with olive oil that would make all of you saying \"Ew!\" right now change your mind about anchovies! The grand total for two tapas and a thimble of wine was about 6 Euros or $7 USD.",
