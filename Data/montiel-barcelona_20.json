    "Montiel is a must go-to restaurant if you are in Barcelona. The Gastronomic tasting menu with the wine pairing is fantastic. The owner, Marcos, is extremely knowledgeable and spent lots of time with us explaining the dishes and pairing. We had an extraordinary meal and a fantastic time. By far my favorite restaurant in Barcelona.",
