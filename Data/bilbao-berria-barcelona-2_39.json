    "Great spot for a bite to eat at Plaza Nova near the cathedral. They serve pinxtos style tapas which does reduce the options for a gf person as much of them are on little pieces of bread. Nevertheless there are some breadless options such as the pot of snails, skewers with potato and octopus or quail eggs and pickles.",
