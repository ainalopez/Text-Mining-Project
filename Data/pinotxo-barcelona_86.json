    "This place is so cool. It's a small restaurant in the center of a local food market, frequented by both locals and curious tourists. I hear it's a bit of an institution here in Barcelona and it's easy to see why. The food is simple, but very tasty. We had a bean stew, small croquettes, and some tiny squid...and it was legendary. Plus, the owner is a total character, joking around with us, and generally trying to be a very good ambassador for the city. Perfect experience and a must for your Barcelona to do list.",
