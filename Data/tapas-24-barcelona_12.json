    "An above average tasty tapas bar just off the bourgeois Passeig de Gr\u00e2cia that serves up the classics using high quality ingredients and provides a lovely respite from shopping with both indoor & outdoor seating. \u00a0But be forewarned, prices here are steep for the portion sizes! When you order something like Bombas (potato & meal ball) you get exactly one per order. Same for the croquettes. It quickly adds up. And the tapas I recommend the most--bikini--is the biggest offender. A supremely delicious Iberian ham & cheese toasty that you can literally eat in four bites...and will run you \u20ac9!!So overall 3.5",
