    "Yes, this place does have really good food but be careful when you receive your bill. \u00a0The optimistic side of me wants to think that it was an honest mistake that they were going to charge us 115 euros for 6 oysters but the realist in me knows that they were trying to take advantage of us. \u00a0I was ready to recommend the place to friends and family and would have easily gone back ourselves but on principle alone I will never go back or recommend this restaurant. \u00a0I hate when people try to take advantage of those that are vulnerable. \u00a0There are so many great restaurants and honest people in Barcelona that I would ask others to boycott this one so that they learn a lesson.",
