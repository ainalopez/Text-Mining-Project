    "Not sure about all the other reviews here. I came with high expectations and I leave with significantly lowered ones. I think it's important to distinguish between a \"good\" Ramen place and a tasty Ramen place. A lot of the reviews seem to be saying that this place is tasty which I can readily agree with. The Ramen was not bad. It was pretty tasty but there were plenty of things that IMHO prevent it from being a good Ramen place.First off, this wasn't even the ramen place I wanted to go to but the one I wanted to go to was closed. Too bad. So I ended up here where there was a bit of a wait. It seemed busy so I was hopeful. However, the fact that there are only, like, 2 ramen places and only a handful of japanese places in the whole city should be a bit of a red flag. I got seated at the bar so I was able to look straight into the kitchen. For the most part it looked pretty clean but I saw one of the chefs crawl out from under a table to get to the \"front\" of the kitchen and I'm pretty sure he touched the floor with his bare hands. Then he went back into the kitchen and handled some nori with those same floor touching hands. Yuck.The edemame was not particularly good. It came out covered in salt flakes which made them way to salty. Seriously, pinch of salt is all you need, what's with the flakes? The ramen was decent, and tasty like I said, but the prices were ridiculous. Why do all the extras cost so much? I wasn't on a budget so I wasn't particularly concerned but it's still pretty annoying to be paying 3 euros for 2 extra slices of chasiu. Come on now.",
