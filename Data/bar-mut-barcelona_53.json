    "Friends recommended this as the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona, so we made it our priority. \u00a0 It is a small restaurant with a great intimate but modern feel to it. \u00a0We really loved our meal here. \u00a0Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. \u00a0We ordered the razor clams which were prepared in herbed and salted virgin olive oil (must-order), the baby clams, the foie on beef which was perfectly seared and marinated, and a house special that I can try to describe but it consists of thin potato strips in egg yolk sauce with pine nuts and parsley that tastes much more delicate than it sounds. \u00a0Add two glasses of wine and it was about $120 US. \u00a0This is definitely one of my new favorites in Barcelona. \u00a0(Check the hours before you go - lunch on Sunday didn't start until 1 pm and the full dinner menu wasn't available until after 8 pm, although we were there earlier and loved our dishes anyway.)",
