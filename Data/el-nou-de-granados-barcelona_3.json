    "I had been to Nou de Granados' predecessor, Or\u00edgens, in the same location several times before. \u00a0It turns out the owners of the restaurant decided to launch a new, refreshed concept and open Nou de Granados...I arrived with my friends at Nou unknowingly on their opening night! \u00a0The staff is the same as before, but the menu is cleaner, simpler, more refined: good, delicious Mediterranean. \u00a0Along with my two friends, I enjoyed a great variety of tapas, plus two fabulous bottles of smooth rioja. \u00a0Life is good at Nou!I was surprised by how orderly, clean, refined, and focused things were for an opening night: the experience was great! \u00a0Even better, these days you can grab a seat outside on Enric Granados (it is, perhaps, one of my favorite streets in Barcelona) and enjoy your meal under the warm Mediterranean skies.Nou de Granados isn't the cheapest restaurant in town, but everything about it (service, food, ambience) is very good. \u00a0Enjoy!",
