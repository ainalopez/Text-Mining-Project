    "Horrible, not so bad service but the food was horrific, I ordered entra\u00f1as steak and it was the most chewy steak I have ever had. At first I was happy to see the portion was a lot but after chewing on that gummy streak I was very disappointed. With the steak I ordered baked potatoes which were also really bad and really greasy.What freaked me out the most that the kitchen uses a lot of microwaves which to me gave me the impression that they don't cook fresh, they did use those microwaves almost on all orders that were ring served",
