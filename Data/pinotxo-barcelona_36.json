    "LOVED this place! During my 5 day stay in Barcelona I came 3 times! Service is wonderful and the food is heavenly. Pinoxto himself was there helping around and being the sweet little old man he is! I am picky with food, but I let them make me whatever they decided and I had NO complaints! Their chickpeas are truly exceptional. Prices are not bad. At all hours this place is packed so plan to possibly wait for an available stool and if you have a purse/bag with you, DO NOT hang it on the back side of the stool as it is very common for people to snatch it (I witnessed it!).",
