    "This is Carles Gaig's more affordable offshoot, near Hospital Clinic. He has 2 other restaurants in the city, one of which has been awarded a Michelin star. Fonda Gaig focuses on traditional Catalan dishes and simple, fresh ingredients. I knew I probably couldn't score a table at Restaurant Gaig, but tried my luck showing up early (they open at 1:30pm) for lunch at Fonda Gaig. I was able to get a table! The restaurant looks pretty fancy with spotless cream furniture, dim warm lighting and red accents. There were no other foreigners in sight and more than half the room was wearing a suit! Service is uber-attentive. Like, you take a sip of your water and someone immediate comes and pours some more. They didn't give me an English menu, but helped explain the dishes that I didn't recognize. I started with the sopa de galets i mandonguilles de l'olla, which is a light broth with pasta shells and the most delicious and juicy stewed meatballs I've ever had... For my main, I had the bacalla (salt cod) grilled with olive oil and chives, served with artichokes. The dish was light, yet really flavourful. Finally, I had this cake/pastry dessert served with lots of vanilla sauce and dusted in icing sugar. It was nice and crispy, although the cake was super dense and I couldn't finish. They also charge you 2.50 euro for 'bread service'. For lunch, you can get the 3 course menu del dia for 25 euros which is really a steal when you look at the individual costs of each item.One of the best meals I had in Barcelona... Highly recommended!",
