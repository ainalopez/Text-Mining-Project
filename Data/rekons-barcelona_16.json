    "Came here for a nice light dinner looking for tapas (based off yelp), but was pleasantly surprised by the delicious empanadas (get the spicy meat one!) and potato and cheese tapas. There aren't very many tapas (most of them are combinations of meats and cheeses) but the place offers fabulous food at a decent price so that's awesome!",
