    "Stumbled into here after walking around and nothing else looked appetizing or was open late.CAVA- went well with the meal- don't really know what is good cava but I was happy with my selectionPATATAS FLAKA - fried potatoes- good with the garlic mayonnaise and paprika- very crispy- enjoyed every bite though after a while the mayonnaise because a little too muchESPARRECS VERDS A LA PLANXA - Grilled green asparagus- quite oily- cooked well; at least it wasn't too mushy- nothing notableFLAN- Home made caramel cream- nothing too special- I could probably make a better one myself\"ORELLETES\" DE LERIDA CON ANIS ESTRELLADO - Catalan crispy pancake infused with anis- not really a pancake; more of a crispy chip- Anis is actually a type of alcohol- the Anis definitely killed the overall dessert; it was just way too much- I would NEVER order this againSERVICE: our waiter was really friendly and spoke decent English. Our food came out at appropriate times. ENVIRONMENT: quite loud. Many people seem to frequent this place or maybe because it's open late. The place is well decorated with menus and mirrors all over the place. They even have food displayed at the bar area to entice your taste budsOverall, decent tapas place. I would recommend ordering the Patatas Flaka. The desserts aren't anything special so I would just save my money. I mainly liked the environment and the wide variety of alcohol that they had. The prices are reasonable. It's NOT a must visit but it'll do if you're hungry or you've never had tapas before.",
