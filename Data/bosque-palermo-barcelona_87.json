    "one of my cheapest and best meals in Barcelona.This is a great neighborhood place. \u00a0I didn't give it the fifth star because one of my dishes was terrible (but meaningless), a girl at an adjacent table interfered with my ability to enjoy my meal fully and lastly - I don't want more people going here and turning this into another tourist spot in Barcelona.I went to dinner by myself so I thought that I was going to miss the Paella since it is typically served as a \"for two\" portion. \u00a0But to my happiness - I was able to order a small appetizer portion for only 5 Euro. \u00a0Then I ordered a pork cutlet stuffed with cheese and finally my last dish was some type of steaks with churrasco. \u00a0My waitress - who may also been part of the owners family - asked me if I was hungry. \u00a0Since I had become conditioned to tapas sized portions - I assured her it would be no problem.I also decided to order a glass of the house Rioja instead of the house red. \u00a0The Rioja was 7 Euro. \u00a0But then the bottle came to the table instead - the whole bottle! \u00a0What a deal. \u00a0Then a large bowl of Paella arrived - which I scarfed down shortly. \u00a0Then a full sized plate with two pork cutlets stuffed with cheese and cooked perfectly. \u00a0I was pretty much stuffed at this point so when my steak arrived - I wasn't even sad that it was highly overcooked and not all the edible. Unfortunately there is no close metro station currently - although I have heard that they are supposed to be building one in the near future somewhere in the neighborhood.",
