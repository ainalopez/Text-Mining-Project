    "Food was amazing and such great pricing for what you get. It was the first time I had a good full sized breakfast, been missing that from the states. Marmalade and Milk have the exact same menu and I just loved Marmalade's ambiance. I am going again because there is so much on the menu I want to try. Waitstaff spoke English and was very helpful.",
