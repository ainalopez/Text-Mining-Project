    "Commercial but good way to ease into tapas scene. Prices are on the higher side but quality is good.Takes awhile to get the attention of someone to seat you. Just go past the bar and be more vocal.easy to order as everything is pictured on the table menu. We ordered the assortment of mantiditos and some tapas (potato bravado was surprisingly the best I had in my visit, peppers were great). We also enjoyed the Spanish sausage and mushroom seasonal dish- would highly reccomend.Ambiance is lacking and very touristy, but clean and well lit.",
