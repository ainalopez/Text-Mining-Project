    "Bro Grill & Bread is a relatively new restaurant in Barceloneta, open for about 3-4 months. I finally decided to try this place tonight for dinner and was not disappointed! The restaurant has a relaxing atmosphere, clean, and the staff were very friendly. The burgers and sandwiches are very reasonably priced for the portion size (5-7\u20ac). I had the grilled chicken sandwich which was great and my wife had the Bro burger which was equally good. The kitchen staff worked fast and our food came out promptly, and I didn't see anyone else waiting for food that long either. I will be going back here, definitely recommend!",
