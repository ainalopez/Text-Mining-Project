    "So i go to this place twice. Firstly the reviewer who said great selection of beers. There was five when i went the first time. And like super expensive for Barcelona. I mean 3.50 for a beer in a mason jar,[a bit 10 years ago non?]just over half a pint,so thats like around 7 euros a pint. Maybe the owner thinks he's opened in echo park. Brings me to my second/ last visit. Do you know what 'slow street food' means?. This aint it. And again,8.50 in barcelona for a burger. You know the minimum wage is 500 euro's a month here,i'm sure you'r friendly female server don't even bank that. But my main beef with this place is this. Why is the owner/chef buying all his produce from one of the cheapest supermarket chains in spain???. Yes,i'v seen you in there many times with you'r trolly stacked. Barcelona is infested with farms,and live stock and you'r serving up 8.50 burgers with garbage ingredients and even shop there with you'r Chivuos shirt on. Jeez. Stay away,do not support a business that claims to be local/street when it's anything but.",
