    "Went there on a Monday evening and got there just after it opened at 8. It was busy within thirty minutes. Friendly staff and a good selection of tapas and seafood options. The seafood paiella is quite good, and would have been enough for two of us, but we weren't sure and each got a pan-fried turbot as well. Both were delicious. Combined with the cheap wine this is a good choice for anyone in the area.",
