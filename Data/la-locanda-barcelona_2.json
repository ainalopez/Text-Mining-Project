    "This restaurant was a mixed bag. The food overall, was good. Everyone enjoyed their meals. The one item I wouldn't recommend would be the vegetable soup - kind of bland and not that big, for 8 euros. Service on the other hand was pretty iffy. Our first waiter said \"and would you like some bread to go with your meal?\" as he was leaving the table. Pretty normal, realized it probably wasn't free, but it ended up being 4.25. A little steep for an offhand comment. Much worse, after I asked the waitress which sauce she preferred on the chicken, she said \"oh definitely the lemon, it's great, and with some spinach\". That sounded great and I said \"wow, you'd do that? Thank you so much!\" obviously thinking that the spinach was additional on top of it. It came out as a side for a brutal 7.50. Just kinda skeezy...Not a bad restaurant, but if you go, beware of the waiters trying to sell you additional stuff off the menu.",
