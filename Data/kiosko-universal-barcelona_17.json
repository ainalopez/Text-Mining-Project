    "Amazing Pulpo a la Gallega.Boiled Octopus, salt, olive oil, paprika. It was amazing. So soft and tender. I thought i was eating fish. Unlike anything I had ever tasted. So simple, but surely its not easy to make it this good.Probably THE food highlight of my trip to Spain.This is a stall in the Market (Mercat de la Boqueria or Mercat de Sant Josep). Its on the edge of the market, so its not too crowded and tourist crazy. Still, its a stall, so you have to sit on stools at the counter.",
