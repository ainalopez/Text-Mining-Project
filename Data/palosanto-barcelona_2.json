    "Back alley graffiti scrawled walls. Looking for a club that wasn't open the night we were here. They don't do mixed drinks but the sangria is yum. The eggplant with honey is thinly sliced fried and gone too fast. The chicken wings came right off the bone and was herbal-ly (is that a word) seasoned - notes of tarragon and Rosemary. My pork cheek was incredibly tender sitting on a small bed of mashed potatoes and gravy - melt in your mouth.",
