    "Stopped in here TWICE because the sandwiches were so good and cheap! A college girl's dream...the first sandwich I shared. We split a chicken sandwich with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and feta. But we had to go back because we needed our own. We went back the next day and had our own that time. I had a veggie sandwich with lentils, feta, the spicy sauce, tzatziki, and the avocado sauce, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions! It was heaven on earth. The spicy sauce has a bit of a kick but it was amazing, especially on a cold day! Don't expect superb service, the restaurant is small and everything is made on the spot and it often times has a line, but the wait is worth it! I will forever be dreaming of these sandwiches.",
