    "Barcelona is one of my fav cities. I have stayed in the area several times and been to many restaurants. Almost always, you get excellent food in Barcelona. The food is OK. If I had gotten the same quality of food in NJ, I would have given it 4 stars. Compared to many other restaurants serving tapas, this one is definitely not among the top. The service is good, as in most other restaurants around here. The price is very fair too.I would definitely go back there for lunch but would look elsewhere for dinner.",
