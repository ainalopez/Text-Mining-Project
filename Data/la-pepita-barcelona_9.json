    "If I could give half stars this would be 3.5. \u00a0The atmosphere was really nice but the food lacked flavor. \u00a0We had a good conversation with some other people dining would had been in Barcelona a week and also mentioned the meal wasn't the best they'd had. \u00a0It's decent enough with good drink...Maybe we just ordered the wrong stuff: papas bravas (best thing we ordered), Argentinan steak skewer, sea bass, calamari, ice cream with popcorn (also pretty great). \u00a0 Just expected more based on the reviews!",
