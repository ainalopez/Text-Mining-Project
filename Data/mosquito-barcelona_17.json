    "We had lunch here the other day and really enjoyed it. My favorite was the veggie gau (like a goyoza but better). The cucumber dish and the rice noodles were also good, as were the veggie dumplings. \u00a0My husband got a pork bun, pork dumplings, \u00a0and a soup and enjoyed them as well. We ordered way too much food and couldn't finish it but it was very good and we both would like to go back.",
