    "This new bar is an amazing addition to Barcelona. They have 12 different beers on tap (lots of IPAs) and a bunch of different tapas and sandwiches. \u00a0The place is very cozy and the staff is really friendly. I had the Rye IPA which was delicious. As an American living abroad it is hard to find places that really know and appreciate good beers. El Tap is definitely a gem. I'm sure I'll be back. \u00a0And don't forget to check out the awesome graphics by EveryHey on the bathroom door.",
