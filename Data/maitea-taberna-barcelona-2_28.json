    "Really good. \u00a0Found it on Yelp, right around the corner from my hotel. \u00a0I'd go back in a heartbeat. \u00a0Very friendly, helpful service. \u00a0Ham croquettes were great, as were the patatas bravas. \u00a0The little cold pinxtos were good and reasonably inexpensive. \u00a0They count up the toothpicks to tally up your bill. \u00a0And the cider was very tasty, too.",
