    "Service was not good. \u00a0It wasn't busy. \u00a0I want to think the girl working behind the bar was new (dirty coffee cup, forgotten parts of our order). \u00a0The food was ok, but not particularly inspiring. \u00a0I've had better vegan fare in lots of other places that pushed the envelope more. \u00a0If I wanted a beer and to chill out, this would be the spot.",
