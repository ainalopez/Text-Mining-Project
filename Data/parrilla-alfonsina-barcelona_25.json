    "Turned up without making a reservation on valentines day, very busy but went out of her way to fit us in. \u00a0Because we had to wait \"15 mins\" the owner gave us a free hors d'oeuvre at the bar, (little deep fried cheese and onion pasties). We had the Bife Chorizo steak which was cooked to perfection (rare) as is the norm in Spain. And the sides were very good which is not always the case( the meat being the only thing that seems to matter). The house red was excellent, we had no room for dessert. Overall, I would highly recommend this small family restaurant, they went out of their way to accommodate us and made the the whole dining experience very pleasant. The cost was under 70 euros for the 2 of us.",
