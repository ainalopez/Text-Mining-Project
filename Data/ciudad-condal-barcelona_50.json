    "thoroughly enjoyed our meal here! this place is super popular and there seems to always be a line at the door, but the line moves very fast since the restaurant is huge! we were lucky enough to squeeze in at the bar though, and to see the fresh selections of canas and seafood selections up close and personal! wine and champagne is by the bottle or half bottle, which suited us just fine. we ordered two canas to start, the foie baguette, razor clams, sauteed mushrooms, manchego cheese plate, grilled whole squid and prawns and everything was sooo delish. for dessert we had more wine and fried cheese on a stick. heavenly! i would recommend skipping the cold canas (though very pretty) and ordering hot dishes.",
