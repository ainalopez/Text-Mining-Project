    "So much better than I thought it was going to be! They have a great selection of sushi and a lot of other Asian cuisine. The restaurant is spacious and gives you a lot of options. If you're not a big fan of sushi they have many options for you. The sushi was a lot better than sushi I've had previously in Barcelona. It was pretty good! During the day, the buffet is \u20ac9.50 per person and then at night it gets more pricey, \u20ac15 I think? I definitely suggest going for the lunch price. Its worth it! The dinner price is a bit much and even more if you get water. Overall, I had a great time with friends going for lunch. I really liked it! And I was stuffed!",
