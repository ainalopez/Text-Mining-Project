    "This place was just perfect. We went here based on other reviews which were great so we had high expectations. It ended up surpassing our expectations. The drinks were unique and delicious. True art of cocktail making! We had the Russian Mule and Vermuth which was so delicious. We then ordered the mushrooms that the lady recommended which did not disappoint along with a burger. We loved the food and drinks! Service was perfect. To top it off, they sent us off with a shot for our trip back. I love this place and we are planning on dropping by again before we leave Barcelona.",
