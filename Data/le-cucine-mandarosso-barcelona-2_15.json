    "I came here with my girlfriend while visiting Barcelona. We had gorged ourselves on paella and tapas up until then, so we thought it would be nice to dig deep and find a spot off the beaten path (for us, at least). The place instantly felt unique and warming, the staff very pleasant and helpful (especially considering our Spanish was merely functional). Every table had a different feel, and the lighting was pleasantly intimate.The food was amazing, leaving us very full and satisfied. The white lasagna in particular was very welcome and different, with amazing artichoke leaves to give it that little extra something. The wine list was strong, and our server's recommendation complimented the food well. Quiet, delicious, and inviting. \u00a0All-in-all, it was a great experience, one I'd recommend to anyone, visiting or living in Barcelona.",
