    "I stopped in at an off time, the unfashionable dining time of 4 pm and the restaurant had a good amount of diners. I started with the 3.50 margarita- delicious, refreshing, and affordable. For the main course I tried the chicken quesadilla with the perfect kick of pineapple. The portion was small, leaving me wanting more, but still tasty.I will be back. Festive atmosphere and nice decorations were a plus too!",
