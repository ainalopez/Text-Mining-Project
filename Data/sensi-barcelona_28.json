    "Restaurant is busy since its in a tourist spot. I ordered seafood paella, it's salty. I ordered half rat, it came with one prawn, one clam, and three pieces of squid. And you will get charge for a bread basket as well, which is I didn't order and I was served it by my second dishes. \u00a0Very disappointed.",
