    "Ate here last night. \u00a0It was a little out of the way so we walked by it at first. \u00a0We were able to get a table outside even though we didn't have a reservation. \u00a0We had a shrimp appetizer which was very tasty along with 2 tapas; foie gras and grilled vegetables. \u00a0Both were quite enjoyable. \u00a0Then came the seafood paella which was great. \u00a0We each had a couple of glasses of the house wine and finished it off with chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. \u00a0It was a great meal.",
