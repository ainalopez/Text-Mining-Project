    "The menu was falling apart and it was hard to understand. The plates were old and worn. The bread, salad, and pomodoro pasta was good, but the ravioli had a strong cheese that took away from its flavor. The salad was good and fed four people. The chicken mushroom dish was good but the potatoes were mushy not crispy.",
