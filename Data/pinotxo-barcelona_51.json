    "A must try. \u00a0The line can get long so get here early. \u00a0Being tourists, the server was very patient explaining to us their various tapas. \u00a0Efficient establishment even though they are busy. \u00a0We had baby squid, croquettas, sausages, Rioja and pasta for the kiddo. \u00a0The portions are nice and really fills you up - perfect for a quick meal stop.",
