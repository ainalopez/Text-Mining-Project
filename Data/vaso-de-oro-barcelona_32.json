    "Great beer and the best tapas, what more could you want?Well...how about an awesome staff in Captain uniforms who break into song every so often? Just another reason why Vaso de Oro is the best tapas bar in Barcelona.Like most good tapas bars make sure to push your way in and get yourself a spot at the bar anyway possible. Its all part of the adventure and it seems to make the food a bit more satisfying after all the jockeying. This is a very long bar with multiple entrances. When walking by once I saw someone literally fall out the door since the space is so narrow between the bar and the door. They rolled past the sidewalk almost into the street. Make sure to get an anchored spot at the bar!Once you make it in order their beer, only two options, light or dark, so this should be an easy selection. \u00a0Their wine is also good, although most drank beer and it seemed more appropriate with all the servers dressed in boat captain outfits. Next you must get a steak, sounds weird for a tapas bar but it is amazingly simple and so good. \u00a0It is quickly seared with quality olive oil, some onions, salt and little pepper. Yummmm...Perfection...Oh wait, and don't forget to top it off with some Foie Gras! Making it somehow better than perfect!If still hungry try their fried chorizo. \u00a0Salty and big with flavor, they are perfect with the beer. The croquettes are also a solid choice. You really can't go wrong with much on the menu.All you need to know is, with so little time on our vacation, with food being one of top priorities, we went there TWICE. Don't miss it!",
