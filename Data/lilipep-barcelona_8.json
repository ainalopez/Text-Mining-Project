    "We stumbled upon this cafe as we were meandering through La Ribera, and were immediately drawn in by the atmosphere. This place had everything I was looking for - interesting art up on the walls, comfy couches to while hours away, books to read (if I could read Spanish or Catalan books, that is).Unfortunately, their kitchen isn't open between 6 and 8 pm, but we were still able to snack on some deadly hot chocolate (so worth the potential artery clogging), wine, olives and cake. Service was friendly and reasonably quick. Would definitely want to come back here to grab tapas - although the menu isn't extensive. Really close to Picasso Museum, Palau Dalmases, and a whole bunch of cool leather goods and art/souvenir shops.",
