    "The food here is to die for...I purchased their salmon sandwich with all toppings. The only problem with this place is their speed. My friends and I were third in line behind two other small groups, and it took 45 minutes for us to order, and an additional 10-15 minutes to receive our orders. The lines are an issue, as there is no designated order and pickup areas; this makes crowd flow very intrusive. It's a good thing that their food is amazing.",
