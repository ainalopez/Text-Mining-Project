    "Seriously and hands down the best meal I had in Barcelona... ever, actually, lets not restrict this to a country or city... THE BEST meal I have had whilst dining out in recent memory.We simply asked the waitress to chose from the tapas menu for us, we were 3 and willing to try anything/everything... which is pretty much what we did, I'd recommend it as a strategy.By the end of the meal we had had everything, it was all excellent, from the sea urchin (a bit odd and sweet but worth trying) to the shrimp they didn't put a foot wrong.At the end, with 3 grown men happily sated and having drunk our fill, the bill was less than 170 euro, brilliant value and definitely worth seeking out of you are in the city.",
