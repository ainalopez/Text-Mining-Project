    "Great chocolate vegan donuts and veggie burgers. Fries are yummy, too!Absolutely love this little vegan cafe! Definitely one of my favorites while traveling in Barcelona. The only thing that would make it better would be if they can open earlier for breakfast. They have a good variety of vegan desserts, croquettes, burgers, sandwiches and snacks.",
