    "I have been abroad for a couple of weeks now and am feeling a little homesick because of the food. My wife found this small little joint that has the best burgers in Barcelona. I didn't get a chance to take a picture of the menu but every burger is named after an artist except for \" the Bronx\". Proper burger with bacon, pickle, egg ( I know, wth?) and all the fixings. The waiter is very helpful and they do speak English. If I'm ever in town again I'll definitely hit this place again. Bravo B Burger Barcelona. Btw, tried to go back today - CLOSED SUNDAY! Dang!",
