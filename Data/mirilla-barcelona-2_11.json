    "Well, what a divine combination of civilized and bohemian. \u00a0Understated awesome. I can't think of the last time I experienced a restaurant/bar with this kind of authentic DIY authenticity and talent that hasn't been \"discovered.\"Languages spoken by the owners include English, Spanish, French, and probably more. \u00a0Everyone was beautifully multi-lingual.Mirilla is owned by hard working young women (earning their dreams with blood sweat and tears) \u00a0who happen to cook up some of the best food I've had in Barcelona (or anywhere) mix a perfect Mojito as well. \u00a0The (mid-priced) food is right up there with anything my (sensitive, experienced) palate has known. \u00a0Foodies will understand how good it is, and so will everyone else who doesn't put on airs but likes eating and drinking.Not sure how to describe the cuisine. \u00a0Spanish fusion? \u00a0Not the average tapas, but definitely strongly Spanish. \u00a0All the ingredients are very fresh and flavorful. \u00a0The veggies taste farm fresh. \u00a0(Sliced/layered winter squash, tomato, basil, goat-cheese backed stack!) \u00a0Some vegetarian dishes. \u00a0I had several seafood dishes that were beyond perfect in freshness, preparation, texture... Well chosen wines by the glass or bottle. \u00a0Mojitos with strong mint, good rum, and raw sugar. \u00a0The service is good, never slow like other places where you may have suffered in Barcelona. \u00a0I mean, don't look for fast food here, but you can expect to be taken care of attentively. \u00a0It is a small place and the owners are often serving you-- they are motivated and thoughtful hosts.The customers are mostly local \"in the know\" types at this point I think. \u00a0Diverse crowd. Couples, individuals, locals, travelers, various nationalities, languages. \u00a0Gay, straight, a very modern cross-section of friendly, lively, non-tacky people. \u00a0Younger, older... all with worldly yet unpretentious good taste. \u00a0What they have in common is they seem to be unusually attractive, interesting, and full of life. \u00a0In short: like Barcelona, just the right combination of grit and pollish. \u00a0I am in love with this place! Be good to them and enjoy yourself.",
