    "While walking in Gothic Quarter we came across Sensi and decided to give it a shot for dinner.Without any reservations we had to wait about 15 minutes but the waitress was fantastic she made sure we had a spot as soon as possible.The ambiance was cozy and cute. Service was simply amazing and not to forget the food was simply amazing. This was the best tapas we had during our stay in Barcelona. Not to forget they did have some good vegetarian options.Highly recommend to those traveling to Barcelona.",
