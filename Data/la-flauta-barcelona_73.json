    "RUN, don't walk, AWAY from la flauta...what a floppa! At 9pm we waited 30 minutes for a table (mostly tourists apparently) and experienced the most frantic, hurried dining experience with just mediocre tapas. In general, \u00a0we felt like we were being moved through a conveyer belt of service. The waiters could care less...and even smiled when my favorite pulpo dish was out of stock (at 9pm when most diners are just getting started?!) Another waiter also sighed when he brought a tapa and there wasn't room on our table to set it...really? Much better offerings in Barcelona, take your money elsewhere.",
