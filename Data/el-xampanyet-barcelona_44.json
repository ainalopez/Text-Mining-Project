    "If you are in Barcelona, do yourself a favor and come here, multiple times.El Xampanyet was the highlight of our dining experience in Barcelona.The house cava is amazing. Even better was the service. The gentleman behind the bar refilled my wine glass before I could swallow my last sip of wine. He refused to gather our plates until every morsel of cheese had been eaten. He even took us behind the bar to be included in our much obliged \"selfie\".We visited El Xampanyet twice during our 4 day stay. Both times the place was slammed, but we managed to squeeze into the bar area and munch on tapas, including chorizo, cheese, and salami. This place had the best vibes and envronment and is obviously favored by many. I even purchased one of the botas hanging outside as a souvenir. I cannot recommend this place enough. I will be coming back...",
