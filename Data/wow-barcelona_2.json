    "Searched on Yelp! for a reviewed Tapas place in the vicinity and plotted towards Wow. \u00a0It was easy to find and walked right in.Being Spain, it was rather early in the evening for dinner (8pm), but the place was open with a few other folks dining and drinking as well.Ordered up a couple beers and perused the Tapas list. \u00a0Wow has menus in English.We ordered up a few items: \u00a0Manchego cheese, Hot roasted peppers; calamari and chicken nuggets.The Manchego was served thinly sliced, drizzled in olive oil with cracked peppercorns. \u00a0Delicious of course.The calamari was okay. \u00a0Not bad. \u00a0Not outstanding. \u00a0Same with the chicken fingers. \u00a0They were good with the exceptional Thai spiced, sweet sauce served on the side.The highlight was the Hot Roasted Peppers (see picture). \u00a0The were not hot as in spicy, but rather, served hot. \u00a0They are slightly smaller than a Jalapeno, roasted, in a light olive oil, and sprinkled with sea salt. \u00a0Their flavor was full...sort of like a poblano. \u00a0One plate was not enough...so two were soundly consumed.The atmosphere of Wow! was great. \u00a0Wooden floors, dark tones throughout, brought alive by modern creative lighting, good piped in music and very friendly staff.Would recommend.",
