    "WOW! We decided to go there based on great reviews found on trip advisor. It was an excellent choice. Service was great, prices were very reasonable and the food was excellent! My husband and I have travelled extensively over the years (including Italy) and I must say that this was the best spaghetti carbonara ever! My husband had the raviolis and they were exquisite. The recommended red wine (No Zero) was perfect. The variety of breads served with the meal was also a delight. Thinking about going back tomorrow for lunch. A must if you are looking for a very good Italian restaurant in Barcelona.",
