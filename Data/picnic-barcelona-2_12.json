    "I can sum up my experience in one word: disappointed. The food was clever but my partner's hamburger came with cold onion rings (deep fried food should never be served cold). I would rate the food the best part of the experience and the atmosphere the worst. I suggest a reservation and a party larger then 2. If you don't fill up a four top you will not have the benefit of a table. We were there as the restaurant opened and were seated at what can be described as a side board, literally a board 22cm wide, how ever this was an upgrade from the couple served on the other side of the window in the window ledge. I just found the environment non-conducive to enjoying a meal.",
