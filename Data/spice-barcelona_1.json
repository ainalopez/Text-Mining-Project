    "Excellent small yet cosy cafe with my favourite carrot cake! Coffee was excellent too and they had chai tea latte for those who like their tea spiced up with cinnamon! The cappuccino and carrot cake cost a little less than 7\u20ac. The cheesecake looks just as delish but we couldn't eat any more!! It's easy to find, barely a 5-minute walk from the Poble Sec subway station and a nice part of that neighbourhood. I think the raving reviews are pretty reliable as I would definitely recommend stopping by for a sweet treat!",
