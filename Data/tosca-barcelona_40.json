    "My husband and I ate here for dinner tonight. We ordered potato wedges with curry and onion mayonnaise, chorizo, sweet potato feta spring rolls, cava sangria, empanadas, and pan con tomate. The potato wedges and sauce were amazing. The chorizo was middle of the road and the rest of the dishes were solid. For dessert, I ordered the apple-apricot crumble and cafe con leche both were very good. My husband had a mojito and the carrot cake. The carrot cake was more of a mediocre muffin with cream cheese (not frosting, actual cream cheese). He ate part of it before giving up. His mojito was mostly mint leaves with a spritz of alcohol. The service was good. Overall 3.5 rounded up to 4.",
