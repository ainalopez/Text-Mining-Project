    "If you are looking for american food then this is the place. Sonora place is run like an american sports bar. Beware, the meals are insanely huge. Starter sizes should fit the normally hungry people. We had starters and main course and it is still painful. Food is readonably good. Prices are extremely fair for what is delivered. A bottle of tasty Chardonnay was 6,50EUR and yes they have a large sortiment of beers.",
