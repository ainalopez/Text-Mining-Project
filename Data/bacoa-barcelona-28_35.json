    "A friend who has lived in Spain for the past 15 years, and who visits Barcelona regularly, took me here for lunch this past week (July 15th, 2014) and I was very content overall. The small boutique 'fast-food' restaurant specializes in burgers, and their menu offers something for everyone. It seems Kiosko is just one of 3 burger joints run under the name 'Bacoa', the other two called 'Bacoa Universitat' and 'Little Bacoa'. I must admit it was a bit difficult to decide between the amazing array of burgers offered, but I settled on the 'Australian'/'Ozzy' burger which came with bacon, grilled pickled beets, cheddar cheese & 'homemade' bbq sauce. It was exquisite, and quite filling, along with the side order of patatas bravas. Along with the drink (a fanta lim\u00f3n), my order came out to 13.90 euros, which though obviously more expensive than your average fast-food meal was quite worth it. One thing to note is the wait time, which is mostly due to the long line at the counter when you walk in. I've heard that this line often stretches out the door, so I was happy to find it occupied by only about 10 people when I arrived. This provided the perfect amount of time for my friend and I to decide what we wanted, and by the time we got to the cash register the employeed quickly took our orders and gave us number placards to sit with so the wait staff could bring us the burgers when they were ready (about 5-7 minutes later). I would also note that this restaurant does take-out, as we observed an employee entering the store and loading up a mini-van with paper bags full of burgers and fries. Altogether a great option in the oversaturated touristic part of one of the world's most visited cities.",
