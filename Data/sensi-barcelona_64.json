    "One of the best meals of my life! We started with patatas bravas and the shrimp ceviche. The ceviche was the best I've ever had. It has banana and apple in it and it's out of this world! Now let's start on the patatas bravas, wow! Delicious!!! Like gourmet potatoe fries with the most delicious sauce. Moving on to our salad with little crostini toasts with Brie and mushroom saut\u00e9e, it was tasty and unique. Next up was our seafood paella and the truffle ravioli. It was our first paella and did not disappoint. The ravioli was good but not my favorite. Sangria was delicious and fruity, very refreshing! This meal was incredible and would highly recommend this restaurant!",
