    "We came too early and they weren't serving tapas yet. So we ate their breakfast menu. We asked to look at their taps menu and it was quite similar to the breakfast menu... So we were glad we weren't missing out.We ordered the bikini and calamari sandwich. They serve two calamari sandwiches per order. It was THE BEST sandwich ever..... Calamari with aioli sauce!!! Yummmmmmm!!! Note that I don't think it was on their usual tapas menu, so we are really glad we got it!The bikini sandwich is I'm pretty sure the same as on their tapas menu. It's a dairy small sandwich of melted mozzarella, Iberian ham, and truffles. It was also very good.We also ordered a peach juice that was fresh squeezed with a hint of mint. Delicious, though a little too tart!",
