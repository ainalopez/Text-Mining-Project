    "For tapas, this place was average. It's in a touristy area with a lot of footfall but that's no excuse.They have a wide selection here and some are much better than others.The warm ones were generally good, the cold ones tasted like that they may have been out a little too long.It's not the speediest place but it's laid back and not bad overall.",
