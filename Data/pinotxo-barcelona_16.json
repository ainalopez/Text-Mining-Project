    "Good but way overpriced. \u00a0I feel like our server steered our ordering by showing us the most expensive seafood as our options. \u00a0Small clams for 12.5 euro and 5 smallish gambas for 17 euro. \u00a0Food was prepared well but not worth the hype or price - seems a bit tourist trappy. Bread was also not the freshest.",
