    "Visiting Barcelona for the first time and they treated us terribly!!!! If you are visiting this beautiful city and not a local stay away! Especially the male bartender with grayish Facial hair! He had an attitude the whole time, never came to check in with us, and rushed us in ordering. I love the people here and these folks were just plain rude and unwelcoming!! I'd never recommend this place to any friends traveling here!",
