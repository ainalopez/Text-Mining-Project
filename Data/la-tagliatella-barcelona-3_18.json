    "Good Italian if you want a break from the Spanish fare. Pasta was suitably al dente and pizza thin crust. \u00a0We tried the 7 cheese which was tasty. Also did pesto pasta and shrimp garlic and oil. \u00a0All very good choices. Best of all you can match the sauce with choice of pasta type, penne, \u00a0etc. \u00a0Service was friendly and efficient.",
