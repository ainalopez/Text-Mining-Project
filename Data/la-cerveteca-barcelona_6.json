    "I like this little beer bar in Barri Gotic. Every time I go, there are a few new beers I haven't seen before, so there is always something different to try. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the ambience of the place is nice. The prices are a little better than some of the other beer bars in Barcelona, as well, so you get good value for money here.",
