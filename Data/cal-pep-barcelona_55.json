    "It's a small place. There will be a wait (~40 min for us). And it will be worth it.This is THE best tapas you will get in Barcelona. The owner seems like a character out of \"Triplets of Belleville\" in the best way. Every single thing we ate was the best we had in our 2-week stay in the city. There was one dish we didn't enjoy (personal taste) and they immediately switched it out for another dish at no charge. The head chef then personally came out to ask us if we enjoyed everything.All the recommendations speak the truth, this will be the best tapas meal you will get in Barcelona.",
