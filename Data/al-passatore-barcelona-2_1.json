    "This one goes for \"Al Passatore Santalo, Barcelona\". Rude, violent chef came out insulting me because I was eating a salad in my pizza box!!! Very threatening attitude, service was terrible but I can now understand why, they are probably scared of this guy, people like this should not have a job, it must be difficult to work under this pressure, I feel sorry for the staff at this particular restaurant.",
