    "Best meal I have ever eaten. Attention is paid to every detail of your visit from when you walk in and see that there is only seating for 24, throughout the meal with every dish being explained, to the end when your taxi is automatically called. The food was outstanding, the highest quality possible, with an amazing flavor combinations. Definitely for a special night out as it will cost about \u20ac100 per person but a must do in Barcelona.",
