    "loved woki....went there twice while in barcelona last few days.....delicious bread, salads, pastries...the carrot cake was delicious...and somewhat settle...rather than on your face...the staff very friendly and helpful...delicious juices...coffee was the only disappointment...maybe because i'm used to new zealand baristas and coffees....it felt a tad bit light and nothing to write home about..highly recommended.mehran (of chicago).",
