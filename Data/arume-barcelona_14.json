    "This is an excellent restaurant, best to book as is very popular for good reason. Hipster decor inc a skeleton at the bottom of a well! Not an extensive menu, but then they clearly concentrate on doing what they do really well! And there is something for everyone inc veggies and they clearly label for allergies , doing smaller portions for kids. Their house signature cocktail the Blackberry mojito is 'banging'! This restaurant is not far from Rambla but you will need directions or sat navy to find as its down a narrow side road ! But definitely worth finding! Will definitely be back when we come back to this lovely city!",
