    "After seven days in Spain and no craft beer in sight I was not looking forward to another seven days on vacation without my tasty beers. Sure there is San Miguel, Estrella, and Heineken beer, but nothing worthy of my love for a hoppy IPAso listen, I love craft beer, I love Oregon beer, but I do not love going seven days with out craft beer -it weakens my soul-can you sense my sadness?So after a few failed attempts at finding a place for craft beer in my first seven days abroad, I had begun to lose hope... however once in Barcelona we found the one and only Cat Bar - establishment of fine craft beer, IPA's, Porters and delicious frothy goodness! The chalk board selection has 12 (rotating?) to choose from, and the usual suspects.. great selection of vegan food, free wi-fi and hipster music.I don't think I'll plan another trip abroad without knowing the beer situation before hand, but Car Bar you saved the day and my sanity!",
