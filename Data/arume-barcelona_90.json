    "We came here after trying to go to Cera 23 based on the yelp reviews. We were directed here when Cera 23 was too busy to take us. The manager at Cera 23 actually walked us over to the restaurant which is 1 block over. I was thinking he might be leading us on, cause he said it was the \"brother restaurant\" with the same owner.It seemed like they just opened Arume because they were a little disorganized. I was worried because some of my guests looked unhappy. It looked like we were the 2nd customer that day, they didn't look busy at all.We placed our order and waited, and waited...After a little while, suddenly the place was filling up. The server came and apologized, they had to redo our appetizers because they messed it up. Uh oh, not good.Well, when the appies came, pleasant surprise, they were really yummy. I had some organic egg dish was really very good, we had something like tempura prawns (gambas) they were really good, crispy and hot!. Other than having to wait for the courses to start and watching the poor server run up and down stairs and start to get flab sweat, I have to say the food was very good and the sangria very refreshing.Our main courses were excellent as well, we had a filet, i had fish, both very well done.Too bad we aren't still in Barcelona, we have to wait to come back to eat here again.",
