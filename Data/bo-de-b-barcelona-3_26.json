    "3.80\u20ac for a Chicken Bocadillo, loaded with toppings.I was overly excited to come here when I read the reviews! On a Sunday, they open at 13:00. \u00a0However, even though I was there a bit before opening, waiting with others to make sure we were one of the first to be served, the place did not even open until 13:20. \u00a0I get it though; small businesses sometimes like to operate on their own time.I took a seat inside and noticed something immediately... The TOGO line was diminishing drastically than the people who were sitting in the restaurant. \u00a0I was surprised because you would think you would want to get the people sitting down out as fast as possible, but this was not the case. \u00a0Now the real details you want to know about: The Sandwich- The chicken was bland, and the toppings were fresh. \u00a0The sauces were delicious, however I wish the sandwich was drenched a little bit more with them to make the chicken taste better. \u00a0Overall, a cheap place to get a good filling. \u00a0However my suggestion is to opt for the beef, and to maybe get a dish instead of a sandwich!",
