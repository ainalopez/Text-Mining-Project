    "Our hotel sent us here and we were very happy that they did. This was by far the most memorable (and reasonably priced!) meal that we had in Barcelona.... a city filled with great food!The restaurant is definitely geared to all types of travelers, which is made apparent by a menu that is written in about 7-10 languages. Don't let this deceive you- the quality of the food is A+Try the Rich Man's Paella... it was amazing!Wine and Cava only 2 to 3 Euro made it a very cheap, delicous date!I will happily come here again on my next stop in Barcelona. Hasta la vista, 7 Portes!",
