    "perhaps my favorite dining experience on my one week european holiday. i walked in on a sunday night without a reservation, but they were gracious enough to seat me without a long wait. i recommend making a reservation to assure yourself a seat. initially, I had gone just to get some paella and wine but when I saw the chefs menu, I knew I had to take the dive. my only reservation was that the paella was not on the tasting menu, but they were kind enough to sub out the suckling pig making the decision easy. i truly enjoyed the prawn, tuna tataki, duck ravioli, and lobster linguini. the chef created dishes that were delicate, subtle, and perhaps even genius. these courses outshined even the paella i was so looking forward to. the wines they recommended were perfect, which they introduced by region and what made the wine special. I didn't elect the wine pairing, but they steered me into the right glasses of wine for my meal. now I've always been a red wine guy, but Barcelona/Catalonia really opened me up to a whole new world of white wines. so reasonable in price, delicious, and airy. service was stellar and the wait staff knew the menu and wines inside out. they weren't pushy at all and possessed a soft hospitality that would put any diner at ease. communicating in english is no problem here. as other reviewers say, this restaurant is michelin star worthy so go and enjoy the extraordinary food and service.",
