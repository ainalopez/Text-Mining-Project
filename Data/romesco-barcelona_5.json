    "Awesome tiny hole in the wall restaurant off La Rambla. \u00a0Amazing fresh seafood (get the seared prawns!). \u00a0Get there early to avoid waiting, and get ready to rub elbows with lots of locals, it's pretty small inside. \u00a0We ended up just sitting at the bar, but watching the chefs at work was well worth it. \u00a0Definitely try the sangria, it was the best I had in Spain (and it's pretty strong!). \u00a0The desserts were impressive as well, so order a couple and share. \u00a0We discovered this place our last night in Barcelona, but if we'd found it earlier we probably would have gone back more than once - it's that good!",
