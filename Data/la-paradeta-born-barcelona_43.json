    "I made it annoyingly clear I wanted seafood while visiting Barcelona and so my friends brought me here. Suffice to say, my seafood craving was (almost too) appeased. After waiting in line for almost an hour, we finally inched our way inside and felt the pressure of ordering. With all that fresh seafood in front of you, it's hard to decide exactly what you want. Thankfully, I was with someone who had been there many times before so relinquished the duty of ordering to him. Before I knew it, we were sitting down with a bottle of chilled white wine, waiting for our food to be prepared. After the first dish of shrimp and oysters arrived, what proceeded can only be described as a parade of some of the best seafood of my life. The mussels in red sauce (which I proceeded to soak the bread in) was amazing, the razor clams and grilled octopus perfect and to end it all, grilled lobster. I am in awe we finished that much food (and an extra bottle of wine) between four of us but we did and all left full and very happy. As others have said, keep in mind that is cash only. Besides that, don't let the line scare you because it is well worth the wait. Definitely a no-frills place I would come back to time and time again.",
