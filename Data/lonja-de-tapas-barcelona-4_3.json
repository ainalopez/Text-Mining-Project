    "What a random find this place was! My original intention was going to this other restaurant in the Gothic area, but the menu was entirely Catalynan and a bar setting, and it just wasn't right for a lunch setting with my family. \u00a0We veered off and found this gem. \u00a0What drew our attention to this place was their lunch special: 3 courses + drink for 9.95 Euros only if you inside but we had no problem with that. \u00a0I ordered the calamari, beef filet, and chocolate/marscapone dessert and of course a white wine. \u00a0I really enjoyed each dish, and it was quite a good serving size! I was leery that they may have downsized each dish because of the special lunch deal, but I was so full afterwards. \u00a0My favorite dish was the beef filet as it was cooked perfectly and it just broke apart with great seasoning and flavors. \u00a0It was spot on. \u00a0I also really enjoyed the dessert. \u00a0I don't often eat things with marscapone but glad that I got to have some on this trip!Definitely coming back for this lunch special!",
