    "This place is beyond over rated! Service is very spotty. Hard to get anything. The old gentleman is super friendly but can't remember any of our orders. I was still waiting for my coffee after we finished all the food. It just never came even after we told him at least 3 times. The food is not nearly as good as the yelpers said. Chickpeas were not bad, but nothing special. Clams are ok, basically steamed in olive oil with salt. The anchovies were disgusting! Soooo fishy! Tasted like raw anchovies soaked in olive oil. How in the world did they get such high reviews from everyone? There's much better food out there guys!",
