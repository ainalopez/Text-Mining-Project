    "Needed a place to eat in barceloneta..... Wasn't sold on anything we read about. Luckily there was a guy who lives in the neighborhood and recommended we walk to the circle and see what our options were. We really wanted tapas and sangria. We looked at the menu and saw that they had a lobster paella and my oh my...was it amazing..... It was three of us...we got a pitcher of sangria....three apps(cod salad, salad with goat cheese, and fried squid rings), and a lobster paella for two and the rabbit...check came up to 101.10 Euros....not bad....yesterday we ate at a place we thought was good but this restaurant was by far the best food we've had thus far. Can't wait to see what's in store for tomorrow",
