    "A happening place. Fun and lively. Considering its proximity to La Rambla, an amazing find. Tapas 8.5 out of 10. Service is deliberately abrupt. \u00a0It's a tapas joint classed up. Make friends with your waiter, show some respect, and you'll have a wonderful time. About 60% tourists, but few dorks in shorts.",
