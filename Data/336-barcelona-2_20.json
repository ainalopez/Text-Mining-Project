    "This is an awesome hidden gem just a few blocks from the shops at Passage de Gracia. \u00a0We didn't make reservation but didn't have to wait for a table. \u00a0the ambience was contemporary chic. \u00a0We sat at a table overlooking the kitchen and the dishes coming out had us salivating!!!! The food was soooo great and the pricing soooo reasonable. \u00a0 We were a party of 2 and both ordered the tapas pre-fixe menu for only 19 euros each. \u00a0They gave you a glass of cava PLUS a whole pitcher of sangria with this menu. First course was a big salad. \u00a0Second course was a sizable portion of assorted cured meat with bread. \u00a0It was a great selection of Spanish ham. \u00a0Next was a well prepared and refreshing roasted red pepper dish with little cubes of ham. \u00a0My fave dish of the menu was the blood sausage with chorizo and fried green pepper. \u00a0The blood sausage was mixed with sticky rice and complemented the spicy chorizo perfectly. \u00a0The green peppers were tasty. \u00a0Then came an egg casserole which served with slices of potatoes pan-grilled in duck foie and two over-easy eggs. \u00a0It tasted so much better than it sounded on paper. \u00a0The last meat dish was the grilled prawns which were fresh and flavorful. \u00a0The finale of a creme bulee style cream rounded out this big meal. \u00a0I normally opted for seafood dishes at Barcelona but this menu widened my view of Catalan crusine. \u00a0You won't regret coming here!!!",
