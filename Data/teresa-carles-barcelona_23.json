    "I went to this restaurant since it seems to have a beautiful number of positive references, however the dinning experience I actually get is quite poor. First the host was working with a poor efficiently, we had to wait more than 5 mins to get our table when the restaurant is barely busy; then we were sat in a corner that's hardly to be noticed, so until our second hosts who was friendly and nice took us over we were served with a harsh attitude and ignorance. The food is, I would say creative, but not taste friendly. The cocktail salad is nothing but mixed vegs with simple thousand-islands source -- which is charged for 12 euros, could the chief be anymore lazy? Main dish are pastas and one eggplant dish, pasta is properly fresh and nice ; but the eggplant with goat cheese is crazily oily and lack of flavor.",
