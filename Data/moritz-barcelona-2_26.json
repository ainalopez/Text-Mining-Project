    "I bookmarked moritz on my way to Barcelona bcause of the great writings but while we were waiting all that time with awful awful service I started to question if I had been at the same place as all u guys who write awsome things about this pkace. We had to wait 45 min for a table(on a monday! And i must say that I don't mind the wait when the food and service is great!) When we finally got that we had to wait for the waiter another 20 minutes, who was rude and very unfriendly. The food was nothing we expected or read about on Yelp or here on tripadvisor. I ordered the small shellfishplate, which cost \u20ac25 but no bread or any sauces came along. And didn't taste very much either, well the octupus was actually disgusting so i had to leave it. It took one hour before we had the four dishes that we ordered. When we finally recieved our bill after asking twice about it, we couldn't wait to get out of this place. Afterwards we were happy just eating Maybe we had the worst waiter and the lousiest chef, but this experience obviously tells that you can not count on getting good food and good service anytime. And for me, thats enough argument not to choose a place.",
