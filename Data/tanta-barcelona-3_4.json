    "I recommend this place. You will have a great time. It's beautiful, most of the food is good and the service is wonderful. We just happen to have a poor experience as we ordered a wok dish (should have known better) in a Peruvian restaurant. Guess they have an Asian influence. It was absolutely terrible. Inedible actually. We left it almost untouched as it was basically like eating pure salt. The other thing is they don't serve tap water, only bottled, which bugs be as its environmentally unfriendly.",
