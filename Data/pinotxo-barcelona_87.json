    "This, and Quimet & Quimet were the best meals that we had in Barcelona. Pinotxo is a small stall where you may have to wait for an open table or seat at the bar; wait, it is worth it. The braised rabbit ribs (I did not know those had enough meat on them!) are outstanding, as are the chickpeas dish. First rate tapas and service. If you do not know what you want want, ask for recommendations and they will not steer you wrong. It is a little pricy, and is well worth it. Beer selection is weak, but the cava is good. Pinotxo and Quimet & Quimet are places you must visit if in Barcelona.",
