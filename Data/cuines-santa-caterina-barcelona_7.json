    "This place is not one but many restaurants all-in-one. When entering you'll notice there are several kitchens surrounding the central area where the table are. When presented with the menu, the customer will be probably confused by the mixture of culinary styles -ranging from Thai to Italian-. Regional food is also present and, like in all dishes prepared there, they boast of using only local-grown food (notice the restaurant is located beside a food market). If you landed in Barcelona recently, don't stick with the paella yet and try some Catalan cuisine, that's a good place to start discovering it.",
