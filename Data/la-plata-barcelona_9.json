    "There's a reason this place has been open for 70 years!I had trouble finding this place initially, but I'm glad I didn't give up! I ordered one of everything and it was fantastic! The waiter was so nice and friendly, explaining everything in English! I loved all of it but had to order another sausage even though I was full because I didn't know when I was going to be able to come again! The portions are good for their price!!!Please come! It's simplicity at it's best but he flavors do not lack whatsoever!P.S. place is very small so look out for tables!",
