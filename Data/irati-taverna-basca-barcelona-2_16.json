    "This easy-to-find restaurant serves great pintxos, but also is happy to seat guests for an excellent early (for Spain) dinner. \u00a0The food, service and wine list cannot be beat, and the prices are reasonable. \u00a0We went there twice the week we were in Barcelona, and once more two weeks later on our way to the airport. \u00a0The waiters are very happy to explain each dish, and are understandably proud of them. \u00a0Everything we tried was superb. \u00a0If I lived in Barcelona I would eat at Irati every week, plus a night or two of pintxos there. \u00a0Its that good.",
