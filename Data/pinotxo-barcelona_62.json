    "A really popular tapas bar in La Bouqueria (largest? open market in Barcelona). Originally found this after searching through a blogger's foodie posts. You'll find people waiting to grab a seat at their little counter.The wait isn't too long as long as you only have a few people. I think they have 6-8 seats max. It's tinny. Just pick whatever looks good to you (food is out on display). =) Though, I would have to recommend the sea bass with balsamic reduction if they still serve that. They'll start you off with some warm bread... always order with a glass of red wine. =)People speak English here.. so that's quite nice especially if you don't speak Catalonian. =)",
