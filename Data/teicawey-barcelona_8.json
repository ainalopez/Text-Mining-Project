    "Not the worst burrito I've ever had but certainly not good. \u00a0We had the Supercarne y uno de al pastor. \u00a0The meat was dry and flavorless, the beans were flavorless, (not sure if there were any) the guacamole was not fresh, the lettuce tasted off and it was the wrong kind of lettuce. \u00a0There was no real sauce on the burrito, no pico de gallo, nada. \u00a0There was really nothing good about this burrito. \u00a0The only tasty thing they had was a housemade chipotle sauce. \u00a0I would not recommend their burritos.",
