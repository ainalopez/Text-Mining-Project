    "This spot requires planning. \u00a0We had multiple reasons why we wanted to make it a stop in Barcelona and once seats were secured (we tried in vain one night and had to check back the next day.) \u00a0Asking for cava, a bottle was delivered so be sure to specify (while we did drink it, the mid-day buzz and food coma weren't expected Cal Pep plans!)Our server pretty much ordered for us and I do recommend it but I'd suggest starting with 2 plates per person. \u00a0I think we had 8 tapas when all was said and done...a bit overboard. \u00a0My favorite was the marinated mushroom caps and padrone peppers. \u00a0Salt and olive oil, what can be better?",
