    "5 craft beers on tap and a wall of bottled beers from all over. On tap, 2.5 euros for a small, 4(ish) euros for a full 500ml pint. Free tastes. Good tapas, a few tables outside, big back room. Saw a sign that said growlers but could not figure out if they actually do growler fills. A tiny perfect little slice of craft beer heaven, right near our apartment. Almost didn't want to make a listing so we can keep it to ourselves!",
