    "After being a bit jet lagged and a late nap we were limited by options based on what was open late. It was a very fortunate surprise for us, as this place ended up being one of our favorite parts of Barcelona. Our waitress was fun and helpful, and when we asked her opinion on items she made great suggestions. I was curious what to get for the last tapas order and she said she would have the chef surprise us, which did not disappoint.We had the goat cheese and tomato jam with toast, amazing! We also enjoyed the squid and veal meatballs with a lovingly crafted tomato sauce, king prawns with a pink sauce, and a lemon marinated salmon dish. All were great, and we enjoyed some delicious local wine and cocktails. We felt like we ended up friends with the chef and the whole staff by the time we were done and there was a great welcoming feeling surrounding the whole place, where you can tell everything from the food to the staff was filled with love and passion for what they were doing. Total five star place!",
