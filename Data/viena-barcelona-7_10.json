    "The thing I like most about Barcelona is if you get out and explore you find the best things. This morning instead of eating at my hotel, I ventured out and walked and walked till I was standing in front of Viena. It has an old timey look so I Yelped it and decided to eat here. To my delight, I ate the best egg sandwich I have ever eaten!",
