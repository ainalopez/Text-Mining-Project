    "Came across this place with my girlfriend while walking to the restaurant we had a reservation at for our anniversary. The ambiance was really nice, the food great for a surprisingly low price, and we really loved the waitress' enthusiasm in explaining about traditional Catalan meals. Definitely recommend to go here if in Barcelona.",
