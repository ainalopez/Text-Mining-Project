    "Having lived for many years in Portland, Oregon, brunch is the only way to do breakfast on a weekend. \u00a0I love living in Barcelona but I really miss brunch. \u00a0Thank goodness I found Milk, which really \"gets\" American-style brunch. \u00a0And like any good brunch spot in Portland, there is a long line for a table here too!My friend & I shared three dishes: blueberry pancakes, the Mexican-style omelette, and the goat cheese salad. \u00a0The plates were quite large and tasty. \u00a0My few complaints were that the mexican omelette was a little off the mark, since the hard Spanish spicy chorizo is just not the same as crumbly Mexican chorizo, and the fried potatoes were seasoned well but a bit too mushy.Now if only they served bottomless drip coffee, I might not notice that I'm in Europe! \u00a0But alas, drip coffee is unknown here in Spain. \u00a0That's ok, I can't complain about a tasty espresso drink.",
