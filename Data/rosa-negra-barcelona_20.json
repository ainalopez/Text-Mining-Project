    "Rosa Negra was really easy to find from the Quinonoas Metro Station (It's literally down the street). I ordered the taco variety plate (9.5 eur), mojito (3.5 eur). As a table, we ordered the guacamole y nachos. The guacamole was super fresh and delicious. It was a super generous portion, we actually had a good amount of guac leftover.Mojito wasn't too well mixed but it was a good balance of rum and mixer. Lots of mint leaves- super yummy! I tried some of my friend's frozen Margarita, which basically tasted like frozen lemonade. So delicious!The taco variety plate was okay. The chicken was a bit bland. The steak was a bit dry. \u00a0I really enjoyed the pork (I think it was pork?) with no toppings. I believe there was another pork taco with caramelized onions on top, which was good but not as delicious as the normal pork taco. Overall, I would recommend the taco variety plate if you're interested in diversity but I would personally get the three taco plate with seasoned pork!",
