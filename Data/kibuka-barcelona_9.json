    "Pretty average. It's fairly good, but not like the best sushi ever. The people weren't really that nice, and when I asked a waiter about a food item that I had never heard of again she looked at me like I was stupid. The restaurant is super crowded too, so not great if you're looking for quiet. I wish I had liked my sushi more, and this restaurant is beautifully situated, but it's sort of expensive and really loud. The interior isn't that nice either, I mean not bad though, maybe I just didn't choose a good sushi choice. I think there must be better sushi in BCN.",
