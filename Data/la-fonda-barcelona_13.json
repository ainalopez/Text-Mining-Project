    "Absolutely terrible. Not only is the quality of the food awful and this place full of tourists but they stole 20 euro from our table. Our check was 54 euro and we needed change so we gave them 80\u20ac and they gave us nothing back. We told them we needed our change and they denied the entire situation and were extremely rude.
