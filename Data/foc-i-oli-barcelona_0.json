    "Foc i Oli is a super tiny place. \u00a0There are ten seats. \u00a0Ten. \u00a0You will sit at a counter. \u00a0There is no privacy.That's normally the kind of place I'd hate, but Foc i Oli makes some incredible burgers.I had the Chivito (thin slices of beef steak, ham, bacon, mayo, salad dressing, gouda, red pepper and caramelized onion on brioche bread.) \u00a0For 9.80 \u20ac, it was a taste sensation. \u00a0I loved it. \u00a0Although not technically a burger, it basically tasted like one.We arrived near closing time, but the guys here were super-accommodating. \u00a0Most locals seemed to grab their burgers to go.They do serve beer (I believe they have just one tap) and have some spirits on the wall, so I guess they can whip up a few mixed drinks.Whether you get a burger to go or squeeze your way into a seat, Foc i Oli is an awesome addition to your Barcelona checklist.",
