    "I would have considered Etapes a 5 star establishment based on service alone; luckily the food was also incredible.First, the service. \u00a0Communication with the staff via email was efficient and they were able to accommodate our party of 8 without issue. \u00a0One guest and I arrived early and decided to chat and wait for our party outside -- a server noticed us and offered to bring us drinks and turn on the terrace heater while we waited. \u00a0Later, one of the children in our group wanted orange fanta while the other wanted just plain orange juice; our server went away to fetch drinks and then informed us they do not carry orange juice, but she asked a bus boy to run down the street and buy some for us. \u00a0That was a really nice touch, in particular for one of the children.The tasting menu was simply fantastic, and well worth the price. \u00a0I'll echo other reviews and say it felt like a steal. \u00a0Fresh scallops, tasty salmon crudo, and tender cochinillo were great highlights, but the wine stole the show: a lovely 2009 Syrah from the owner's cellar complemented the meal nicely.Will definitely return on my next trip to Barcelona.",
