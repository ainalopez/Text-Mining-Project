    "This place doesn't deserve less than 5 stars-- and the salad is as amazing as everyone says, and more. Ridiculously delicious. So were the empanadas. You just cannot beat the combo! Again, it lives up to the hype. Great value for amazing casual food. The only thing that sucked for us is that we were there somewhat late (10pm, not super late for Barcelona) and they were out of many of their empanada options, so we had them bring whatever they had. Didn't disappoint though.We ordered a ham, cheese & potato casserole on top of the combo and it almost made us take a nap on the spot, it was so simple and soooo good. Came straight out of the oven, piping hot, potatoes perfectly cooked and seasoned, and that HAM, for gods sake. THAT HAM!!!We initially tried ordering more food but service gave us a heads up that it was going to be a ton of food, and she was right. Even though I would have loved to try whatever else it was that I wanted to, by the time we were halfway done with the casserole, we were feeling stuffed to the brim. But we couldn't let that ham go to waste so we ended up picking at the rest until it was like half a crumb of potato left and we left the restaurant in good pain.We reminisced about Rekons for the next three days (and still going). Go here for a meal, trust me.",
