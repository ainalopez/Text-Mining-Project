    "Each dish we had was better than the last. The paella here is unparalleled. The best we had throughout the entire city. Seafood so fresh it was still moving in their display. 3pm on a Friday allows for joyous company at the end of the work week. Singles, couples, groups of folks laughing and enjoying their meals. Service was friendly and relaxed, chefs their guests with \"welcome home\" and a handshake. I would highly recommend this place! Class and great food.",
