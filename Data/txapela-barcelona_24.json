    "Steps away from the wretched food at Qu Qu was Txpela and at the bare minimum it was a step in the right direction. Basically you pay a few euros for a two bit sandwich or piece of bread with different stuff on it. 99% of the food is already made and sitting in a glass case to view. Somehow I think that they think this is a good marketing strategy, to me it's disgusting that they just let everything sit out all day. They also have a picture menu for point and click access. yelp.com/biz_photos/UctY\u2026Mini Club Sandwich - Not bad but not that great. I wish it had been served hot.yelp.com/biz_photos/UctY\u2026Unidentifiable Stuff on Bread - Pretty sure it was a combination of seafood, mush, and some other stuff. But without getting into too fine of details, this one was again just okay.yelp.com/biz_photos/UctY\u2026Foie on Toast and Octopus on Stick - This was the least bad thing we had that night. The layer of foie was razor thin but it tasted good. The octopus was nice and tender and had some flavor. yelp.com/biz_photos/UctY\u2026Sliders - One was just a burger and the other I think was heart or some other offal. Regardless, both were dry, tough, chewy, bland, etc. Bleh.yelp.com/biz_photos/UctY\u2026Overall, better than the prior meal but still a far cry from anything I'd call \"good.\" Never again!",
