    "When we walked up to the store front I was a bit worried. \u00a0There's graffiti all over the windows and the walls inside. We we greated warmly, sat and offered drinks, \u00a0we were the first lunch guests.The back area of the restaurant is quaint. \u00a0Our server had no issue with answering our questions about the menu, and made recommendations. We both had the \"pepitas\" several house specialties. I had tuna with avocado and radish, my boyfriend had the special sausage. \u00a0Both were incredible. \u00a0We also ordered the potatoes with fried egg that may sound simple but was amazing! Loved this little place, \u00a0definitely recommend!",
