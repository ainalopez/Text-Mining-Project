    "Every city has a legendary dining spot, where both locals and tourists flock. Philadelphia has Pats Steaks, New York Katz Deli. Barcelona is no different with Viena Cafe. Situated on the busy Las Ramblas, Mark Bittman of the NYTimes said it was the best sandwich he ever had. Maybe its offered all over the city, and maybe its slightly more expensive in the tourist district, but the Jamon Flauta here is a culinary experience.",
