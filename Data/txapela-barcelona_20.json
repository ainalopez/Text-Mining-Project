    "Txapela is perfectly average...like going to a Ruby Tuesday in the states. Decent food and no flair, which is fine by me.I tried to take my son to a real tapas place a bit further down the street...I could tell he wasn't wild about the idea. So, I felt like I was flaking out by going to txapela. However, the German pilsner was cold, I could check my lame version of the Spanish language at the door, and could point to exactly what we wanted on the menu...cool. For kids, they have mini hot dogs, fried chicken, and calamari tapas, making it easy on the parents a bit.Txapela is a comfortable way to ease into the tapas scene in Barcelona, just be sure to move on.",
