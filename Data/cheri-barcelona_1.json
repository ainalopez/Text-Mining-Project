    "I was first intrigued by the romantic an intimate interior of this venue, as I was strolling through town. The monocrome checked floor, mirorred wine shelves on the walls, antique furniture and rustic chandeliers made this place feel like I had stepped into a ballroom a century ago. The friendly service and wine selection was impeccable. The best and solid readin for this five star rating is the food. Our Belgian style mussels in spicy tomati and wine sauce were a great apertizer with just the perfect about of spices and salt. The japanese style tuna fillets with miso dressing was amazing. After buying a bottle of wine I deckded to stuff myself with a third round of their food-gasmic lemon shorbet. It was the best part. This dining experience certainly offers the best of Barcelona with a wide range of seafood and meat dishes. Worth visiting if you want a true piece of 'culture' during your trip.",
