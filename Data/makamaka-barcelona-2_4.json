    "Makamaka is all hype, no good food. \u00a0I will say I enjoy seeing the wooden forks, knives and spoons that you can write on and tack on to the wall for generations to come! \u00a0We are from San Francisco so we wrote on a spoon and are hoping that it stays there for many years! \u00a0I asked for a chicken sandwich while my guy had the Makamaka burger. \u00a0He was thrilled with his burger, but my sandwich was a chicken THIGH. \u00a0Gross!! I asked the waitress who was nice, but stressed, if they had chicken breast. She didn't understand me. She brought over the manager guy who spoke better English and he said to her \"she doesn't want this (and pointed to her thigh), she wants this (and pointed to her boob!). \u00a0Very funny story and this WOULD NOT go over in the US very well, but I thought it was funny. \u00a0She said oh, we don't have that like it didn't bother her at all what he did/said. \u00a0Funny!! I sent the sandwich back and ate nothing because I don't eat beef or pork and they only had chicken thighs. \u00a0My guy finished his burger and we scrammed. \u00a0I found a good place down the street with food that I could eat. \u00a0Boisterous crowd there though and a fun atmosphere, but this is the epitome of \"Meh, I've experienced better\".",
