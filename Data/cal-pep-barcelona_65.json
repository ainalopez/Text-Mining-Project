    "Perfect way to end our trip to Barcelona. We waited for more than an hour and it was well worth it. The waiter was terrific and we loved all his suggestions (potatoes least fav)! The razorback clams were amazing - my only complaint was I didn't have room for calamari and it looked great. Lots of fun.",
