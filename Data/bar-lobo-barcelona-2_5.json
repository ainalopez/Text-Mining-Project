    "Was searching for a place to eat a late breakfast and stumbled across this nice little place located on a small pla\u00e7a. I was going to give it 4 stars, but the staff wasn't that smiling and inviting, actually the waiter seemed a bit annoyed about us being there. The food was good though and the restaurant was very nice and cosy with funny lamps and cheerful chairs. Had the egg florentine and the Spanish omelette.",
