    "Amazing spot. They don't speak English so you know it's mainly local customers. The food was amazing, they have some real authentic tapas dishes. Just go with the flow I'll not tell you what I had, ask what is good if you aren't sure, be patient with the language barrier the food is worth it. It was humorous ordering to be honest. really great older staff, in a lovely little restaurant which is posted as being the oldest in the port area, which is 1753. \u00a0We were recommended this place by a local",
