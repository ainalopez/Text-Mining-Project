    "I really LOVE this restaurant. I was born in Madrid and I'm currently living in Beijing... so every time I go back to Spain to visit my family and friends. I always go to Gopal every time I happen to go to Barcelona. In Beijing is kind of difficult to find vegetarian restaurants... imagine vegan! The only thing that I don't like about their burguers is the bread. Too much bread and I'm never able to finish the whole thing...",
