    "Solid meal and a Michelin star restaurant. Overall a very fairly priced tasting menu. The food was of a good quality and presented well. The flavors were quite straightforward and although we enjoyed, not somewhere I would go twice. Seems the restaurant wasn't full Wednesday when we went, we dined from 8:30-11:30 and only about 5 tables came in for dinner.",
