    "This place is crazy, yummy fast food Catalan style with Cava of course. Unfortunately there is nearly no way to avoid making a mess of yourself and others when crowded, and it gets REALLY crowded, this is standing room only glasses are poured to overflow (i think the tender is a bit of a sadist watching and laughing as everone freely spills amd drips on each other and everywhere) I felt the need to wear a rain slicker or rubber while there, certainly don't wear a white shirt like I did! Really fun and tasty but you were forewarned. :)",
