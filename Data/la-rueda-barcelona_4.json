    "The first thing you notice before entering the restaurant is the big charcoal grill with lots of big pieces of juicy meat on top... Of course you can have an idea on how flavoursome the meat is with charcoal :0 The restaurant has a very relaxed atmosphere, very well priced (around 25 - 30 \u20ac per head with wine and dessert, portions are big) and the \u00a0meat always cooked at perfection. This is the place for meat lovers without doubt. You can also find a very extensive selection of wines for all the budgets (they also have a page with wine on offers, with nice bottles for less then 10\u20ac). Highly recommended to try: chuleton (20\u20ac for 600 grams, it melts in the mouth) and at the end of your meal the typical Uruguayan cake (it is called chaj\u00e0) with meringue, peaches and dulce de leche...woooooooow it is absolutely delicious.",
