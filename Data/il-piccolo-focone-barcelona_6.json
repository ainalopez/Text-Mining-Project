    "This place simply has the best gluten free (homemade!!!) pizza I've ever tasted. When ate it, I was terrified that they had given me the wrong pizza, and had to ask to be sure it was gluten free. So good.The owner and all the staff were wonderful. Although his english was bad, the owner was very inviting, and it was sad to leave him. On my short 4 day holiday to Spain I went here twice.",
