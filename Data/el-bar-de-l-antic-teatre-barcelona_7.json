    "A few colleagues brought me here for a beer in December, so it was a little cold, but we had a great time nonetheless. What struck me the most was how unassuming the place is. Tucked away in the middle of a narrow alley, I would have walked by the place time and time again not knowing that it was a bar or restaurant when in actuality it's a massive outdoor sanctuary with plenty of tables and lots of trees. I can only imagine how great this place is during the summer time. Highly recommended for a relaxing afternoon or evening of laid back chilling with friends!",
