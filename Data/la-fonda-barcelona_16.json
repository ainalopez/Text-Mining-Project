    "Loved this busy, little place. \u00a0There was a short line outside the door waiting to get in! \u00a0We met a small group of lovely older ladies that told us to definitely eat at La Fonda. We were out shopping for souvenirs on that street.Prices are moderate. Its typical European seating (close quarters for Americans) but it was lovely. The food was awesome. We had paella. It was a good stop! \u00a0no regrets. :)",
