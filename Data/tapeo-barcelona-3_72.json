    "Can I give them six stars? Tapeo is the BEST tapas I have ever had. The oxtail was rich and perfect. The pulpo a la gallega was amazing. The stuffed squid was otherworldly. The sangria... well, I normally don't drink, but when I do I prefer Tapeo sangria. Stop reading and go eat here- if you're in Barcelona, that is. Even if you're not in Barcelona, this place is worth the trip.",
