    "Left a lot to be desired. We were drawn in by the nice atmosphere and decor but left disappointed. The appetizers were bland and lacking a certain something. Fried potatoes were basic with a mayonnaise sauce. Artichoke hearts were grilled and seasoned with only olive oil. The chicken was undercooked. The servers were very friendly and decor was nice but food was not good unfortunately.",
