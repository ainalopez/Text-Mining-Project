    "This was one of the best restaurants that I have ever eaten that. If you factor in how affordable it was, especially for the quality of the food, it may be the best restaurant I've ever eaten at overall. The food was amazingly fresh and every single dish delighted. I don't generally speak in hyperbole, and I honestly mean everything that I'm saying (typing) right now. I highly recommend it. I was there in August of 2012, with a group of guys for a bachelor party, and every single one of them thought that the meal was at least very good (some agreed that it was terrific). Whenever I have a chance to return to Barcelona I will absolutely go back to this restaurant.",
