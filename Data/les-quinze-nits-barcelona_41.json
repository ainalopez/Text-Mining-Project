    "Honestly, I don't wanna give any star but the lowest is one, unfortunately. My guidebook introduces this restaurant but I didn't attention it until I saw the long line in front of it. So I went there the next nite for dinner. We could get a table quickly and I saw the ppl in it but all of them were not Spanish. Well....but I didn't care about it at that time because the price was pretty cheap and I was really expected to have Spanish food with cheap price. When I saw my dish, I really was disappointed on it. The taste was ok but plate was just simple and nothing. And the service was horrible. My friend asked him to bring ketchup and he said ok. But we couldn't get it until we went out. Also you must ask them a bill as soon as you finished order. Coz it takes 1hour to bring it to you.",
