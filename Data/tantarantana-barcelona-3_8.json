    "So there we were, probably the only two girls in all of Barcelona named Sharon sitting at a table at Tantarantana's front terrace. \u00a0On probably the hottest day of the summer, this shady spot was pleasant, and relatively quiet... the perfect place for a mid-day bite. \u00a0Now the restaurant is a narrow strip extending the length of the block, with an upstairs dining area, and patio seating in both the front and the back. \u00a0The atmosphere inside was charming - but way too hot on this day in question. \u00a0We both got the mini hamburguesas - which are nothing like \"sliders\" for you american readers. \u00a0an order of this appetizer/small plate is 2 strips of \"pan de coca\", and 4 mini burgers set atop a bed of grilled onions (2 burgers on each strip of \"coca\"). \u00a0 Dotted with dollops of tapenade and mayo - this dish was quite savory. \u00a0I really liked that toasted \"pan de coca\". \u00a0prices seemed fair on the rest of the menu - with most items between 8 & 12 euros. \u00a0They had tapas, salads & egg dishes among others - i didn't really read the menu though.",
