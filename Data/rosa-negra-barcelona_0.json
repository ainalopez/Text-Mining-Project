    "Really good spot for a couple drinks and tacos. They are by far the best tacos I've had in Europe and one of there salsas is actually spicy (like real Mexican spicy, not European spicy). Of course they are not the street tacos one would find in Mexico or California but they are extremely well made for a restaurant. You can't go wrong with a normal margarita, the strawberry one was a bit too sweet for my taste but to each their own. The mojitos were also a little too sweet but they seem to be a popular drunk amongst the locals. This place was filled with locals from the area and a couple tourist who strayed. The service was fast, efficient and very helpful when ordering drinks and food. Must try if you're in the area!",
