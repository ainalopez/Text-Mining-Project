    "Seems very touristy, but is actually quite good. The baked goat cheese and honey salad is excellent. I also had rare tuna over pur\u00e9ed pumpkin - also very good. The dessert was amazing - I forget what it was called, but it had nougat ice cream and chocolate sauce - it was like a deconstructed snicker bar! I recommend this place - I was alone and enjoyed the people watching and friendly-ish wait staff. They have menus in multiple languages. There was a big line waiting for a table through the whole meal.",
