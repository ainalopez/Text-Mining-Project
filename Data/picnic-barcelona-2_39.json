    "Picnic has been on my list since I got to BCN because it's got a good write-up in the Analog Guides I like so much, and all I can say is that I'm bummed I waited so long to go! I grabbed a great, leisurely lunch here last week before heading to the airport and was absolutely enamored. \u00a0Off of the prix-fixe I had the fried green tomatoes, salmon with basmati rice, a glass of white wine and then split the zucchini chocolate cake and hazelnut ice creams with my friend Maya and was delighted. \u00a0The fried green tomatoes were an absolute dream and the fact that all of this was twelve euros each was the icing on the cake! \u00a0We sat outside and enjoyed the sunshine but the inside is super charming too. \u00a0I can't wait to come back and sample what else they have to offer!",
