    "Husband and I were walking around after checking in to Hotel Claris and this place is only a block away. It is New Years Day so a lot of restaurants are closed. This one happened to be open so we walked in and it was PACKED! We were seated almost immediately after looking around for a seat. The menu was very colorful and had pictures. All you had to do was point to which number you wanted and they would bring out small tapas for you. They also have menus in French, English and other languages but you do have to ask. I didn't need to ask as the concept was simple but the table next to us were French and struggling. Each tapas select ranged from 1,75-1,95 euros. The food was decent, the left side of the menu was all hot food and the right side were cold dishes. We had 2 coffees with milk2 bottles of waterand about 12 tapas.Our bill was 30euros. Pretty decent.",
