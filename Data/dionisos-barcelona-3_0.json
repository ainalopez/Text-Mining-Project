    "Great great great Greek restaurant!The interior is beautiful, with creative olive oil lining some of the bright blue walls, and newspaper articles and paintings/photographs lining other parts. I got a really simple dish, a rice stuffed pepper, and it was impressively good. I cannot even tell you how good it was. The rice was really great tasting.The restaurant is in a great area of Gr\u00e0cia, near everything including the metro station.",
