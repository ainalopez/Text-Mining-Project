    "Fantastic, excellent, exquisite, classy restaurant. What else can I say. Me and my friend bumped into this classy restaurant surrounded by trees. You wouldnt notice there is a restaurant because only a baner with the name of \"La Balsa\" was placed at the pole. We speak no Spanish but they do have an english menu. Service was ok but couldnt expect much from Spaniards. The food is exquisite and delicious. Very pricey though. But worth the price.",
