    "Mi esposo es barril sin fondo, meaning that he can eat and eat and will not get full but he was deliciously satisfied here. The food was AMAZING. Love the homey vibe and under 20euros for a complete meal with dessert. Delicious! We are coming again before we leave Barcelona! Favorite place by far!",
