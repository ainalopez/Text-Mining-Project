    "This place was very nice. It has 2 menus - traditional and surprise tasting menus. We opted for the surprise menu as many of the other patrons did as well. The food was amazing and the portions quite large for a tasting. For a little extra they pair the food with wine which really adds to the experience.The dining area only seats about 24. I guess they could fit 30, or so, if necessary. It was a nice size to get the right amount of attention from the staff.We were really pleased with the whole experience, and would love to go back.",
