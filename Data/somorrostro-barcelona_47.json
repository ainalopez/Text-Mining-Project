    "This place was a great find during our Trip to barcelona (8/13). The menu is all fresh food from local farms or fisherman.Since the menu changes daily I won't go into detail of what I had but we did the $35 menu which is an appetizer, entree and dessert and we also grabbed a bottle of white wine. All of it was delicious.The staff is also very friendly and helpful in choosing items or wine if you don't know what will pair well.",
