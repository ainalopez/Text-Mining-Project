    "Bar Celta is where I would eat 2-3 times a week if I lived in Barcelona. This is crazy - I don't even eat seafood! It's small and authentic with an eclectic local crowd. I loved the red wine and the small plates- the cheese, the patatas bravas - with extra bravas and hold the aioli, and always 2 orders of the pimientos del padron. \u00a0 I am not one for the eggy tortilla thing but my husband enjoyed it. I love this place for a simple easy meal without a lot of fuss.",
