    "During our very long trip from Italy to France then Spain. \u00a0I admit this was one of my favorite meals. There is no menu but a man comes over to discuss your likes and dislikes. My daughter has worked for Coqueta so was very familiar with some of their dishes. \u00a0We had spinach salad , \u00a0egg carpacio, octopus \u00a0(sauce was amazing), filet with foie gras. Everything was fresh and service was attentive. Thank you.",
