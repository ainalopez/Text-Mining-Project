    "The hand-drawn ramen is a great dish! I was pleasantly surprised by this Chinese restaurant. I stumbled upon this place when I was extremely craving Chinese food. I wasn't expecting too much from it because after all I'm in Barcelona. Can't say much about other dishes, but the hand-drawn noodles proved to be more than authentic! With the beef broth, minced meat, and some veggies, the noodle soup was priced at 3.50 euros! It might be too small of a portion for people with good appetite though. Avoid the Xiao Long Bao if you're looking for the real thing. It's more like a pan-fried bun instead.",
