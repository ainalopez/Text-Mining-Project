    "I'm a big fan of their gin and tonic (like other yelpers). \u00a0Is it the way they prepare it, the ingredients, or the presentation? \u00a0Regardless, the goblet / glass is huge. \u00a0It's not your typical gin and tonic at some SF or Vegas club where they give you a small glass.Do you like fois gras? \u00a0They make an excellent fois gras here. \u00a0So good I had to order 2 for myself. \u00a0Look at my photo since pictures are louder than words. \u00a0There's other tapas I tried but the fois gras was the most memorable. \u00a0I suggest you try the fois gras and 3 random ones since your preferences will be different.One last thing. \u00a0The digestive they give at the end. \u00a0I'd go for the coffee version. \u00a0The herb one tasted more like medicine whereas the coffee one just taste like coffee.",
