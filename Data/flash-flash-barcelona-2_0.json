    "What an incredible meal! And it's so nice to NOT be hovered over while eating. The staff allows you to enjoy your meal time and doesn't wait for a the tip.. as we learned, they don't expect a tip, but my sister being from NYC and myself from California.. tipping is second nature.. be trips end, we learned not to leave them.. how extremely hard that was. I guess they think it to be rude.. who knows. Since it being winter, it was so hot and steamy inside, for me.. my sister was completely content. The salad, tortilla, wine, peppers, well everything was perfect! Absolutely loved it. And such a wonderful menu for the vegetarians in you. If you are unable to read Spanish, they have menus in English, just ask, they are all to happy to assist. Would love to visit their swanky restaurant once again! The bathroom was super clean and just as swanky!",
