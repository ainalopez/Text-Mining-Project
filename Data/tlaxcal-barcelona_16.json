    "I came here for dinner, and it was such pure perfection that I came here for my next meal and ordered the same exact thing. I got the pescado tacos, and they were the best tacos I've ever had. (We're from LA, so we know our tacos!) Ever. For dinner we also got a bottle of white wine which was extremely reasonable in price and yummy. Highly recommend.",
