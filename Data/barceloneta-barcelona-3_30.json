    "We came here on a Monday night and it could have been a weekend night the atmosphere was electric. The restaurant was very busy but there was still an intimatcy about it. We had amazing prawns to start, cooked in a light batter they were simply devine. For mains we had sole and lobster both were fabulous cooked in garlic butter with some lemon and fried potatoes. To top off this amazing meal we finished with what can only be described as the wettest, creamiest, boozeyest (yes that's a word) tiramasu ever. Totes awesome all washed down with a wonderful cava. Definitely come here you won't regret it.",
