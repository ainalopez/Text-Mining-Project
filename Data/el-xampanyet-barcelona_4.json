    "Happened to walk by just as they were opening, as we were on our way to find a new tapas place to go to after learning that Cal Pep was closed for the holidays. \u00a0There was already a line of about six people out the door just before they opened, which is always a good sign. \u00a0I had recognized the name from a list of best tapas, and I am so glad we came here. \u00a0We got a seat at a table, and the restaurant filled up within 20 minutes. \u00a0People were standing in corners waiting for a table as we were getting our first course. \u00a0They do not have an English menu but are happy to explain the menu. \u00a0What we got:Anchovies Octopus in a green oil based sauceTuna belly with what seemed like white asparagus but not sureJamon IbericoThe food comes with a side of the ubiquitous bread that's spread with tomato and garlic, which they refill as needed.Everything was absolutely delicious! \u00a0Loved the busy atmosphere and dining with locals and tourists alike.",
