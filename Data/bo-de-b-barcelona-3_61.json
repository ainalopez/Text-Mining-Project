    "Honestly the sandwiches are great if you don't mind dealing with an hour long line and horribly rude workers. The sanitary conditions are so questionable and only about 8 people total can fit at their tiny tables. Also be prepared to get yelled at for not doing something right (asking for a fork, standing inside in line, etc.) Specify if your order is to eat in or take away or else you will also get yelled at for sitting at the tables. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!",
