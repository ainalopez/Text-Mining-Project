    "Nice restaurant in a Plaza. \u00a0If you are going for dinner, be sure to be there at 7pm, because there will be a line for the wait. \u00a0It's worth the experience!! We were seated in the second floor which had a nice view into the Plaza.Tried out the Black Rice with Cuttlefish & Pasta that were very good!! \u00a0We also tried a rice with octupus black ink. \u00a0Service is impeccable, ambience and decoration is very chic!",
