    "Ate here our first night in Barcelona. Wonderfully surprised by the exceptional meal.We ordered several tapas and a bottle of tempranillo.You can get good potatoes bravas anywhere in Barcelona and these did not disappoint. They had this white bean dish with poached egg... Runny yoke all over the place... Yum!Octopus... Perhaps the best I've ever eaten. Not sure if it was pre poached/pressure cooked and then grilled... But whatever they did, it was fantastic. Served over some mashed potatoes and beautifully presented on a black slate platter.Buratta salad... A-OK. Wife super happy!We have great food in San Francisco... But you can't find this quality food (with wine) at this price in SF. I love this restaurant and I love this city.",
