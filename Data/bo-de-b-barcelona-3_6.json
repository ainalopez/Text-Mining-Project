    "Stopped to grab a sandwich here due to the long line and cheap prices. Unfortunately, it's definitely not a fast-moving line! Even when I got to the front, it took quite a while to be acknowledged because they were still working on all the other orders. They do stuff quite a bit into the sandwiches, making them quite atypical with options like corn, lentils, olives, etc and it's all quite fresh. A tasty sandwich but not an amazing one and not necessarily worth a really long wait if you've got other things to do. A girl in line told me that it was mentioned in her guidebook so seems like backpackers like it.",
