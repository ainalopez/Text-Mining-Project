    "Great vegan restaurant with a lot of variety of veggie burgers. The quiona with algae is very tasty. The Dahl pattie is a little bland but still tasty. Burgers can come with buns or with a salad instead. They often have specials which include little potato fries (like hashbrowns) and a drink.Their display case shows all their veggie burgers and also baked goods. Their chocolate donuts are tasty. The chocolate coating is very yummy and the donut I quit soft. A must try for all you vegan donut lovers.They also serve a variet of beverage from kombucha, juices and water to espresso! Great little spot with seating for about 8. The spot by the entrance is the best spot as there is an open window where you can feel the cool breeze and watch the people walking by.",
