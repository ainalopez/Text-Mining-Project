    "First, I went by myself at around 15:00 and the place was pretty empty. \u00a0Tried to sit at a table but was told I had to sit at the bar (even though only two tables were being used). \u00a0Usually I would just leave at that point but since all the reviews were so great I figured I'd stick it out once.Had the oxtail, octopus and calamari. \u00a0The main reason I went to this place were the reviews and pictures of the calamari, I love stuffed calamari. \u00a0However what the reviews don't mention is that the \"stuffing\" is just a kind of sweet paste. \u00a0Not really my thing. \u00a0Oxtail was nice and tender as mentioned but also on the sweet side. \u00a0Octopus was ok.The service was not very good, no one offered to help me with the menu (I only speak English) so I had to use my translation app as best as I could. \u00a0 Plus starting out with being told to sit at the bar isn't going to help the whole \"experience\".Basically another miss brought to you by Yelp.",
