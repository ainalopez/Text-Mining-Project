    "Epic surprise! Amazing fresh and tasty food for under 5 euros! Mostly anyways! Amazing!!!!!Came here on my morning walks. Saw the place and I just had to try it. They have buffet and ala carte. They take your order and put it down the chute? It was fun watching the little tiny elevator like thing came back up with food. Like a lot of food. I was very sick from all the cold weather, soup was a much needed. And this place had it. A very tasty amazing hand pulled noodles. Beef hand pulled noodles~ superb! Everything is superb from the noodles to the chunky beefs. Fried dumplings~ I wasn't expecting the dumplings to be fried. But they were quite tasty!Fried rice~ a mountain or two of them for one order. No joke!! And every single table in the restaurant orders it. It is pretty wok~y, smoky and good. Kind of had that perfect charred, burnt little fluffy eggs, steamy mountain thing going on. Now you know that's going to be good!I've also had this beef dish. It was beef and onions? I liked it. Best part about this place is definitely the prices. They can't be beat in Barcelona!! I thought I was going to get only half portions for such low prices. But nope!! The service is prompt. Not much English but you are in Barcelona!! The only thing was my tea! I wanted some traditional pot of hot tea. What I got was a mug of hot water with a tea bag. It wasn't cheap!! But that was also part of lost in translation I feel! Overall, so much good food for less than 20 euros!!! And It's only a 15 mins walk from las ramblas! Try it out!",
