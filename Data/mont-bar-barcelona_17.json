    "I was on a business trip with a colleague. We asked the concierge at the W for a recommendation of a place locals would go to. She recommended Mont Bar. This was probably one of the best food experiences I have had - definitely the best in Barcelona! The place, according to the staff, has been open for about a year.  I can't say enough about how great this pace was. The service was world class - and \u00a0as many may know, service in Europe tends to be more laid back than the US. Complimentary bread and olive was presented to us and with help from the staff, we ordered the jamon (of course), grilled prawns, piglet tartine, mint lamb and best of all the smoked tuna belly confit - can you say heavenly? Even the sweet tomato bread that accompanied the jamon was to die for. With a bottle of Chardonnay Cava and finished with an assortment of Spanish cheese this was the perfect meal. The staff was wonderful, friendly and never let our glass go half empty. Even when we finished our bottle they gave us a round of complimentary cava. What appeared to vs the owner or manager told us how he wakes up every morning at 4am to go to the markets and get his fresh ingredients - and indeed the quality came right through every bite. I hope Mont Bar stays around for a very long time as I hope to eat there every time I visit Barcelona.",
