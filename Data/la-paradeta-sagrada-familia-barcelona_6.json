    "My favorite restaurant in Barcelona. You go in, pick your seafood victims displayed by the cashier, tell them how you want it cooked, pay, find a table and wait for your number to be called. Brilliant. Razor clams - Best grilled razor clams I have ever had in my entire life. It wasn't overcooked, it was fresh as hell and just so damn good. Clams - They ask you if you want it with tomato sauce or grilled, pick the tomato sauce, you won't be disappointed.Calamari - This was the only thing we had fried and we were so glad we had it this way. Batter was light, fragrant and on point - nothing that upsets the stomach, great!Baby octopus - These little suckers are divine when grilled and eaten with a splash of lemon juice.Cuttlefish - Again, got these bad boys grilled and it was super fresh with lemon juice.Giant prawns - Wow! These were the size of half of my face, no joke - super juicy. Service was friendly and bathrooms were clean. When I visit Barcelona again, this place will be on the list for sure.",
