    "This Argentinian-Italian restaurant had surprisingly great food for the low price point of its full meal (we both had the empanada/pasta/dessert/drink option for less than \u20ac10 each). \u00a0The pumpkin ravioli were especially tasty and nicely al dente. \u00a0The service was very friendly. \u00a0You order at the front, and they bring the food to you.Recommend!",
