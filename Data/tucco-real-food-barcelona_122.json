    "We were searching for a central restaurant, that wasn't overpriced, while on our travels, and never imagined that we'd find such a homely, welcoming restaurant tucked away in the tourist district of Barcelona. This place is full of heart, the service was excellent and the food, delicious! We both ordered the ravioli which was just as good as Nonna's! Coming from two Italian girls, that means a lot!The owners even offered tips for our stay and made the time to stop for a chat. We'll definitely be back!",
