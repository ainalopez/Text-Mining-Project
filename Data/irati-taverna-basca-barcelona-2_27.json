    "This place was just ok in comparison to the other tapas places. There were a few items I did like though, the cheesecake tapas, the cheese and crab, and the jamon with mushrooms. The sardine one was overly salty, and wasn't so excited about some other things we had (goat cheese which I usually love was just ok).",
