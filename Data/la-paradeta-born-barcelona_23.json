    "What an excellent, delicious, fresh and affordable experience. I recommend this whole-heartedly to any tourist looking for a fresh, amazing seafood meal for a good price. Here, things work a little different: You stand at the front counter, and just point to all the different food you want. It's possible to specify how much as well. We ordered: one massive stuffed crab, tons of razor clams, about 12 gambas, a big bowl of steamed mussels in tomato sauce, some fried squiggly things (very good), and a salad (why?). Two beers as well.The price is all by weight. We had so much food that I thought I was actually going to burst, and it was \u20ac20 each. Incredible. They're open for lunch or for dinner, and the food is some of the freshest in Barcelona. It goes right from the ocean into the restaurant. Just amazing. Go hungry!!",
