    "Starters were very good. Scallops cooked perfectly \u00a0and chorizo tacos were great. Yum!Bit of a mix up with mains resulting in one of us eating at a different time to the other, hence the 4 stars. Food was amazing. The duck rice dish is very tasty and the red tuna was seared perfectly. Top tip: get the hazlenut cookie with violet icecream and marscaponie for desert - it is AMAZING!!!",
