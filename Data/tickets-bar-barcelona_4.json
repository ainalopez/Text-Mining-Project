    "I wish I could give this place 10 stars!! Hands down the best meal I've had on the trip or ever actually.. it's ranked as top 42 best restaurant int he world! It was such an amazing experience and I think everyone should be able to have this experience. You'll need to make reservations 2 months in advance. We ordered almost everything on the menu.. well actually they picked for us but we probably ate the whole menu. The place is themed like a circus which was really cute. Every dish was just amazing and made you go \"woah\" each time something touched your tongue. Food:-Olives: Changed my life for olives forever! The best-Basil air waffles: wow-Crunchy Pizza: so good and loved the cheese-Nordic Landscape: So cool and yummy-Octopus: The best one i've had in Spain! Must order-Chicen and air: Very interesting and very good-Manchego cheese on mini airbag: best cheese ever-Tuna hand roll: they come out and make it in front for you-2 different oysters: Both were awesome! $6 each wish I could of eaten it all-Shrimps: actually could of done without it but still greatFor dessert.. ask if you could go to the secret dessert bar! It was so fun and felt so cool that we got taken to the back for it. When you first got seated it looked what just a flower in front of us but behold we were able to slurp the middle jello it was good! At this point we were pretty full but of course wanted to try all the desserts! It was all amazing too. Basically had a 7 course dessert tasting... overall our bill was about $200 for two people. I can't stop thinking about this place..",
