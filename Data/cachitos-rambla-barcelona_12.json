    "It was nothing impressive unfortunately. The interior was \"old-school\" but it was not ugly by any standards :).The food on the other hand was a bit surprising. Having eaten seafood paella in france we expected it to have clams, prawns etc but in reality it had about 4 small prawns in it and the rest of it was sausage pieces (in a paella??).Had the chicken and cheese croquettes as well. Chicken ones were good but cheese ones were made with mozzarella which is not my personal preference. But for some people it will be delicious!We also had maccaroni with parmegiani and iberian meat. The whole thing was just a stand of boiled maccaroni, little cheese on top and boiled small pieces of meat.For drinks had Cava Sangria which was very nice.Overall i would not recomment going here for paellas if you want to have the spanish experience. If that is your preference then grab a taxi and go yo Barcelonetta - they have a bunch of good restaurants/pubs offering paellas.",
