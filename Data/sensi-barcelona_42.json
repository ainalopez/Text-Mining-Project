    "Beware of Tourist Trap...everything is good except food. Food: 1Sangria: 4Ambiance: 5Service: 4This is coming from San Franciscan standards which might be a little bit picky, but I am pretty objective about the freshness and preparation of the food. The octopus I had was mush, clearly frozen multiple times. Their house dish of duck is extremely bland. I ordered 5 things including their octopus, duck, casserole, imberico ham, and paella. I'll reserve judgement on paella because my taste might be different from authentic, but everything else was pretty terrible. The ham was cheap and not aged properly, it had no aroma. Nice place to sit and talk, but don't come for the food!!",
