    "Yaya, which means grandmother, is a great place for a relaxed meal, with excellent food and of course, a pitcher or two of their fine sangria, mixed up from scratch with either a red or white cava (a local proseco style sparkling wine) - the duck confit was amazing and worth trying, as well as the fish soup - and the beans with a pigs ear sausage - price was also good and service was as warm and friendly as one would expect in the Catalan region of Spain - I would happily go back again!",
