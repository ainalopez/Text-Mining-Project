    "It's hard to review classics, as Can Paixano/La Champa\u00f1eria definitely is...What you see is what you get here: really delicious, really cheap bocadillos, tapas, and--most importantly--cava! \u00a0I'm a fan of the ros\u00e9, myself, and it goes down like candy. \u00a0Be prepared to bump and push and shout and demand at this bar. \u00a0It's always packed and the staff is, if anything, a bit rude. \u00a0But it's worth it.I'd give this place five stars if, I guess, it were a little less popular! \u00a0Sometimes I wish it were just a little more low-key, a little more of a diamond in the *rough*, not a shining star in tourist guidebooks (as I suspect it now is).All that said, I love la Champa\u00f1eria, and when I'm okay with being packed into a tiny, grimy, less-than-friendly place, I make the trip...the champagne, food, and \"real\" atmosphere are all a package deal, and--despite the crowds--it's totally worth it!",
