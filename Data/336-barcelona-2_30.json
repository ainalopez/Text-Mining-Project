    "I've eaten at some nice places. \u00a0Eleven Madison, Le Cirque, Nobu, Gary Danko, Breslin, NoMa, and Sushi Yasuda to name a few. \u00a0I can assure you this place is at least worth two michelin stars, definitely more than 1! \u00a0At 25\u20ac for 3 courses it's a bargain as it includes a liter of sangria and a glass of cava for two. \u00a0Frankly I was blown away. \u00a0While the chef described the cuisine as \"comfort food,\" our iberico con asparagus, razor clams, black sea bass and beef stew were full of flavor and life! \u00a0Bottom line, don't miss this stop in Barcelona and come early in your trip as you may want to return before you leave the city.",
