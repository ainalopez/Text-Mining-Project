    "Food was delicious. Servers were extremely helpful and spoke both English and Spanish very well. We shared the croquettes, nachos, and the Surf and Turf. The croquettes were delicious and there were 6 different kinds on one plate. The nachos were great, the vegan sour cream was perfection. The surf and turf, albeit a bit small, was delicious. So great to find amazing Vegan food in the heart of Las Ramblas just off the street.",
