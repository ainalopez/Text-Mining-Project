    "Best meal we had in Spain hands down!There is a wait but it went by pretty fast (20mins) and we went on a Thursday night, it's completely worth it don't let it deter you.When you get in there is a huge array of fresh fish and seafood sitting on ice. Surprisingly it didn't smell! We had a lobster, giant prawns, mussels in marinara, and calamari. You pick it, they weigh it and you move on to buy beer and wine and sit down and wait for them to call your order. Took only about 15 mins to get our food. You have to find your own place to sit which wasn't a problem the night we were there. Food: The mussels came first and the marinara was delicious. So fresh, plump and not gritty! Loved it. Second was the calamari, honestly it was perfectly cooked, soft and tender squid, easily the best I've ever had. It came in a simple olive oil garlic and herb sauce, soo good. The prawns came with the same dressing and were awesome. Lastly was the lobster, it was a bit expensive but so delicious. Looking back we probably would've just got more of the other seafood just because of the price/quantity ratio the lobster. They also give you some bread for dipping and a salad. I realize it may be hard to understand how this could be so good, \u00a0but the fresh food, simple preparation and no frills atmosphere really did it for us. It was great to have a break from all the tapas/bread/fried food. And in Barcelona you're going to find that you have to pay a lot just to eat something different, but at this place that wasn't the case. We got a hugee portion of seafood with wine for about 50 E, totally worth it!Would I return? Yes!",
