    "Great pizza, dont get me wrong. ( really)But service was so bad, and server so rude, that im never coming here again. Although I have to admit it is a very good pizza. Sad the waiter ruined my experience. Actually paid for my Pizza and was so annoyed at the waiter not setting my expectations right that i left !!! ( you know how it is in spain, they say 5 minutes it takes 15, but u usually smile because of their charm and fun positive spirited people) . But this guy was different.Anyways great pizza, just annoyed. Never Again## please note this is the gracia store i visited.",
