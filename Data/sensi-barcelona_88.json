    "Wow!I had never tried tapas before I walked into Sensi but my girlfriend was determined that I would try some. I thought I might as well try it somewhere with a good reputation so I don't get a bad view of tapas and my word did we pick a good place.The Duck Timbale was truly amazing, it actually reminds me of a local Scottish dish called stovies. It's a mix of potato and duck with a very light cheese topping, so much so you can't really taste any cheese. I actually returned two nights later mostly to eat this dish again.Then we have some of the other dishes which were also very good. The Iberic shaved ham was good, not the best I've had but still good. The \"Padr\u00f3n\" peppers were also very good but once again not the best. The classic filet of beef was great and I'd certainly order again, although the potatoes were a little harder than I'd like. The suckling pig was fantastic. The seasonal dish that night was swordfish which was, again, fantastic.Then there is the service. The staff are super fast and were really nice. When we returned a few nights later they remembered us and even remembered what we had ordered which made us feel very welcome.The only downside was we asked for tomato pressed bread and it never arrived on the first night but that is merely a smudge on a masterpiece. I'm thousands of miles away as I write this and I'm craving some of the duck.",
