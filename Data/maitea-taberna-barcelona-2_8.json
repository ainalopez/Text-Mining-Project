    "It's easy to walk by this unassuming place and miss it, but definitely it's a great option if you want an inexpensive, delicious Pintxo experience. \u00a0The other tapas are fine but definitely where this restaurant shines is in the vast range of both hot and cold pinxtos.My advice is to grab any empty stool and bar space that you see, help yourself to a plate, and then let your eyes guide the rest of your meal. \u00a0The cases of cold pinxtos are delicious and we noticed that they get replenished / replaced pretty frequently, especially as dinner time picks up. \u00a0The waiters pass trays of hot pinxtos as well starting at around 8pm so if you get there a bit early they will let you order whatever hot pinxtos you wish.I'd recommend:- Smoked salmon with a seafood salad filling (yum)- Thinly sliced jamon (yum)- Pickled anchovy with a fresh pepper relish (really good, it sounds weird but the flavors were really bright and popped)- Bacon wrapped dates - not a pinxto but it was a very generous slice of bacon wrapped around a perfectly warm, melted dateGood but not my favorites:- Country pate with pickled veg - these were weirdly warm and tasted almost like salami- Shrimp on seafood pate - the pate was not as flavorful as I would have liked and was a bit spongyGreat sangria too! \u00a0A liter-sized pitcher was 15 euro.",
