    "If you're a vegetarian, everyone will tell you Teresa Carles is the place to go in Barcelona. \u00a0It's been around since 1979, which is amazing to me knowing how obsessed Spain is with meat. \u00a0I definitely passed by a \"Ham Heaven\" at one point on my journey. \u00a0But it's been a mainstay in Barcelona and I'm sure it'll be around for years to come! \u00a0It was bustling on an early afternoon and we barely got a table. \u00a0Definitely make a reservation!Everyone spoke English, they have English menus, and they clearly label what is vegan or what can be made vegan. \u00a0Amazing!I was in dire need of some fresh greens, so I opted for the Pumpkin and Crispy Tempeh salad. \u00a0It was delicious and a much needed break from my diet of bread and potatoes. \u00a0I loved the tempeh and the soy yogurt dressing, I just wished there was more of both! \u00a0I found my salad a little too dry and boring as I came to the end of it. \u00a0But thankfully, for the most part, it was delicious and refreshing.My husband, who is as picky as they come, loved that he had the option to make his own salad. \u00a0Their ingredients are top notch and he almost licked the bowl clean, it was so good.While waiting for our food, I enjoyed a very nice soy latte, and for dessert, I grabbed a nut milk to go. \u00a0I had the cheekily named \"Horchiata\" that tasted like horchata but was filled with chia seeds. \u00a0It kept me full for hours as we explored the city.I'd love to come back when I'm not salad-deprived and try their vegan lasagna and desserts!",
