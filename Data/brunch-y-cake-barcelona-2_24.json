    "I only had coffee here but it was really good.Barcelona seems to be enjoying a coffee renaissance a little bit like the one London had maybe 6 or 7 years ago. A lot of decent coffee shops are opening and this is one of them.Lovely atmostphere inside, super friendly service, good prices and good coffee.It's a bit off the beaten track so is mainly for locals, but if you're passing through this part of town it's definitely worth a visit.",
