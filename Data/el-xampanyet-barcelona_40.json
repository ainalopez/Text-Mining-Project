    "4 stars for the food but 3 for the crowds.Ambience: Jam packed at all hours of the day. I even tried arriving before opening but there was already a line and it was shoulder to shoulder once inside.Makes for a stressful dinner.Service: Not bad considering, but you won't have any of the servers time to discuss options. You simply have to know what you want to order which can be tricky from the Spanish-only menus.Food: Very good. You can select from some tapas dishes presented on the bar or order from the menu but it all seemed good. I had Variado (for 2) which was a portion size somewhere between an appetizer and a main like that. It had a section of shellfish (mussels, razor-back clams, squid and a few others I hadn't ever even seen before) in a vinegar/oil mix with a side of bread. It was excellent. My only beef was that I was also looking forward to some Sangria but they don't serve Sangria in this bar. Seriously?Price: On the high side even for Barca, but definitely food above the average tapas fare.If I could go back at a time when there were no crowds I'd go, but I think I'd skip it next time in town.",
