    "This is a FANTASTIC example of Catalonian cuisine. The people here were incredibly incredibly friendly, and showed so much hospitality to a newcomer.This place was recommended by some locals, it's a place where the locals go out to eat and we were one of the few English speaking people in the restaurant.It's also very old, and has great character... it's an all around fave. Definitely recommended for a real Catalonian experience.",
