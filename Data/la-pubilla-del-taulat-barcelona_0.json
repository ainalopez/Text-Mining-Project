    "This place was great. The fish was fresh and delicious and the tapas were amazing. I really liked the look of the place too, it has charm and it's authentic. The staff was very nice and helpful. Definitely taking visitors from other countries here, it's exactly what you expect from a local traditional tapas bar.",
