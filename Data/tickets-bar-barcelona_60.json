    "The meal was creative and different although I have to admit I wasn't excited by the flavours as much as anticipated. Next time I'd be specific with my menu so hopefully I'd be more satisfied in the end.Next time I would order definitely Olives, Crostini, Tuna Belly Cone and Tiramisu. I would likely order the Tuna Belly & Sea Urchin, Orange Salad, and Artichokes. But I'd be more interested in the Tapas from the Sea/Land items such as Confit Tuna Belly, Grilled Unilateral Cooking Lobster or \"High Level\" Sirloin Steak.eatlikeushi.posthaven.co\u2026",
