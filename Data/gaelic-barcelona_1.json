    "What a cute little bar on a quiet side street in the extremely touristy area of town (Gothic quarter). We were drawn into this place because of the sign touting local craft beer.... well, we are pretty much obligated to try the local beer, right? Anyway, the owner was nice and was polite about my broken Spanish skills. He let us try a couple of the beers before ordering a pint and gave us some corn nuts to snack on. The beers were very tasty, we had a red/christmas ale and a lager. I would recommend this place for a beer... especially if you want to get away from some of the overwhelming crowds.",
