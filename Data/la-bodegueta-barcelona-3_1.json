    "We came here while on vacation based on a suggestion from a Barcelona travel book. The patatas bravas were delicious here, they came with a hot sauce that had a very mild but delicious kick. The calamari was tender and flavorful. The fried archichokes were crunchy and had a very good flavor. The jamon iberico was just as delicious. The overall flavors of all dishes were good, the portions and prices were very fair.",
