    "Somehow we got lucky and visited El Xampanyet during a not-so-crowded month. \u00a0During our second visit, we listened in on the conversation that an Irish tourist was having with the owner's son about not being able even set foot in the door back during their vacation in September due to it being so packed! \u00a0I'm not a huge champagne drinker because it usually gives me headaches, but I will take acception to El Xampanyet. \u00a0Their house cava is very smooth and worth the aftermath. \u00a0I still crave their cheese stuffed pimientos, white asparagus marinated in their cava, olives, cheese, and assortment of jamon. \u00a0The waitstafff (who are all family) is super friendly and accomodating. \u00a0It's funny to hear them bicker between each other in Spanish and turn around and smile at you and give you the best service. \u00a0They are atune to the fact that their customer base is comprised of mainly foreigners...with a few locals that seem to not have jobs.",
