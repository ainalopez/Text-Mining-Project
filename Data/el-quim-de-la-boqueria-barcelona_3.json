    "So good and so fresh. This place is slammed in the weekends, so either get your vacationing self up when the market opens, or come on a weekday. It's still a crapshoot to get a seat at the bar, so just hover around someone who looks to be almost done. I had: fresh squeezed orange juice, fried eggs with tender tender tender baby squid, squid ink, chili and olive oil sauce, and fresh baguette for sopping up the leftovers. Amazing. You almost never go wrong with the specialty of the house. The DC had a more traditional fried egg and jam\u00f3n breakfast. Pretty amazing as well.",
