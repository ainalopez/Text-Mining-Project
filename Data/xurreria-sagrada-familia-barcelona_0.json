    "Great location, very close to Sagrada Familia. The Nutella-filled giant churro was incredible! If it weren't so expensive (2.50) I would have gone back to get a second. If you're near Sagrada Familia and looking for a dessert, you have to try this place! Seems to be cash only, so be prepared for that.",
