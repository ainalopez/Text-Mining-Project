    "We spent 10 days in Madrid and Barcelona. \u00a0This place was recommended by a local friend in Barcelona. \u00a0It was the best meal we had the entire trip! \u00a0Most everything we had was the best version of it from the trip.The Paella was good, but a bit small.The croquettes were great.The Sangria was very good and they had a bunch of different flavors to try.The best part of the meal was the flan at the end! \u00a0It was the best Flan I have ever had!",
