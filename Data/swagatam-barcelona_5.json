    "A really great local Indian Place! The food is good. It's usually super busy on Friday-Sundays, because it's really popular.The staff is incredibly nice and welcoming. My only real complaint to this restaurant, is that the Chicken Tikki Masala is really tomatoey. Everything else that I've been served there has been really good.I'm not sure that it is the best it could be in terms of food, but it's quite good, and deserving of 4 stars wholly.",
