    "Crowded and expensive, but pretty delicious and worth it if you're just in Barcelona on holiday. \u00a0Located in the heart of the market, it's great for people watching and taking a break from walking around. \u00a0Also, who else serves foie gras with fried eggs? \u00a0While the prices on the typical tapas dishes are higher than other places, there are some unique signature dishes that stand out.",
