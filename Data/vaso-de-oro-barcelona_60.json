    "Great bar but you do need a little patience. The middle doors open straight on to the bar. The end doors open in to the slightly more roomy corners. You will get served eventually. If you ask for Rubia you will finally receive it after it has been poured, settled, poured again and the froth levelled off the top. You have to either have seats at one of the limited tables or be at the bar to be served tapas dishes. Beer glass breakages are frequent due to the use of tall fluted glasses. Be careful where you put yours. Visit and enjoy the experience.",
