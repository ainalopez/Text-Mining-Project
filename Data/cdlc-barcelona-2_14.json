    "If you are a middle aged surban housewife that needs to let loose for an evening, then this is your place to go. If you are a young traveler like myself, \u00a0you might see my disappointment. Like most clubs on the beach, \u00a0the drinks are expensive. The layout of the place is amazing, I must say. There are beds everywhere. A nice view of the beach. \u00a0Changing lights, \u00a0and to add drama to the \u00a0palce, there is random smoke. Yet, I do not come to dance clubs to lay on beds, I come to dance. The DJ was absolutely terrible. He would go from hardcore rap, to rock and roll, \u00a0and then mix in some country. It was just awkward. The age range of the club was early 30's to late 80s. Not my type of party. \u00a0Avoid this fake hip hop club and go enjoy your night in Barcelona elsewhere.",
