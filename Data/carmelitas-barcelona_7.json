    "We came here for lunch during our trip to Barcelona. \u00a0We all ordered the prix fixe menu, I had the fish and it was ok while my sister and husband had the chicken. \u00a0Our beers were served quickly as were all of our dishes. \u00a0The desserts were good as well. \u00a0Overall the experience was enjoyable. \u00a0The service was fine too.",
