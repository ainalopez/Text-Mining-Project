    "Loved this place. Food was afforable but very good. I can't believe the price of wine in Spain! So incredibly inexpensive. Our host recommended this place to us and we wanted to go back for a second night, but it was too crowded. They give preference to their local regulars, so don't be too alarmed if you see someone come after you and get seated before you. I recommend come early or very late.",
