    "After trying Sweet Vermut at Cala del Vermut for the first time I really wanted to buy some bottles of Sweet Vermut to bring home. I emailed my great host, Joe, from the Barcelona Taste and he recommended I check out Morro Fi if I wanted to buy some bottles to bring home with me.Morro Fi is very small and sits probably no more than 8 people. We went here for both a pre-dinner and post-dinner drink. They sell Vermut in plastic jugs, which you can easily take home in your luggage. They sell bottles in glass as well. I originally came here with the purpose of buying Sweet Vermut, but to my surprise I discovered their homemade potato chips. These chips are amazing and are huge! We bought three bags of these to take home.",
