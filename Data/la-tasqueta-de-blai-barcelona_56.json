    "Great Pincho selection. \u00a0Quality food with \u20ac2 each stick. \u00a0Self serve and very convenient. \u00a0You grab a plate and pick the food you like and they count the number of stocks you have to determine the price you pay. \u00a0Because food is precooked, hot plates will no longer warm by the time you are served. \u00a0However, cold plates are very tasty and deliciously made.",
