    "We went there for our last meal in Barcelona. After reading the reviews we were expecting a restaurant that specialized in rice dishes. In reality this restaurant is a Catalan restaurant, that prides itself in the traditional foods of Catalonia, and has some rice dishes.We were looking for something more upscale, and different from the usual tapas that we had been eating during our stay in Spain, and this place delivered. The restaurant is an old fashioned restaurant, with experienced waiters that take care of your needs, and provide you with very good guidance as to what to order. The staff was friendly and very informative, and really made our experience a very memorable one.The food, was traditional, but really well done, and honestly a great change from the usual stuff we had during our stay. We had the young roasted goat and the asparagus with romesco sauce. The goat was incredibly tender and beautifully flavored, served with potatoes and roasted tomatoes, my friend, that was concerned about eating goat, ate the whole thing! The asparagus served with the romesco sauce were perfectly grilled and the sauce worked great with this dish.The surprise was the dessert. We had a delicious chocolate cake served with mandarin ice cream (following the recommendation of our server) that was out of this world, and an Xixona style ice cream that tasted like almonds are supposed to taste, it really spoiled almonds for me! The location of the restaurant is an old clock shop that was owned by Frederic Soler, an important literary figure in Barcelona, known as Serafi Pitarra. The place is covered with pictures from early Barcelona, and old clocks, it is worth a visit around the place, while you wait for your food to be ready.",
