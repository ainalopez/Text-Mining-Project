    "We dined here last night and ate tapas style. Smaller plates of octopus, potatoes, mussels and local mushroom and baby squid croquettes with ink. Each dish was delicious. We were fortunate to have Baleria as our sever and she was excellent in explaining the menu and serving the food. We expect to be in Barcelona from time to time and will dine there frequently.",
