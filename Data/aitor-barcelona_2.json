    "My wife and I stumbled upon this spot a few days ago, on the 2nd day of our honeymoon. We've been back twice and are planning to go back tonight. It's two blocks away from out hotel (Hotel Sagrada Famila on Corsega) and had become our \"last stop\". \u00a0The tapas are so much better than the normal touristy fare that you'll find at about 1000 places all around Barcelona. \u00a0The tapas range from the expected (cured ham and cheese) to the unexpected (salted fish stuffed peppers) to the I'm still not sure what that was and I kinda don't really care (I think it was fried black pudding, and it was amazing). The price per tapa is 1,40\u20ac. You grab a plate, load it up and the owned charges by how many toothpicks are on your plate. There's an all you can eat price, but we haven't done that yet. Out bill for 12 tapas, 3 glasses of wine and a bottle of water came out to about 23\u20ac. What really blows us away is the owner and how much pride he takes in running a good restaurant. He's always moving making sure the place is clean, the tapas are fresh and the drinks are flowing. When my wife left a shopping bag of new boots at our table he put them behind the bar and had them waiting once we realized that we left them. We're still in the process of exploring this town and have been finding great places to eat all around the city. But our plan until we leave is to stop here every night for that last drink and snack.",
