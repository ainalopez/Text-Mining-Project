    "This place was great! It was recommended by a Peruvian waiter we met earlier in the day. We started off with the ceviche Classico... Delicious... They use corvina and it was perfectly marinated. Then we tried a maki roll that had langostino, aguacate y pez de mantequilla. \u00a0That was pretty good as well. \u00a0The best was the dinner that we shared... It was called Chaufa Tapao... It was like a fried rice with chicken, pork, and veggies covered with scrambled egg and lobster. \u00a0That was delicious! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Barcelona!!!",
