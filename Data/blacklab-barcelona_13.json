    "Very yummy American food! We happened to be walking by and saw someone with their nachos (not on the menu because it's so new). We thought we would just start with that and a few drinks but ended up staying for dinner too! Nachos were DELICIOUS!! Our favorite of the whole night.We came during #blackhour so my boyfriend had a beer for a euro off and he had the straight up burger (with homemade ketchup and fries), juicy and delicious!I ordered the meat and veggie dumplings (under dim sum) but really are just potstickers! We shared a bottle of 13\u20ac wine, wasn't bad!Total bill was less than 40\u20ac. Very relaxed/cool vibe to the restaurant, free wifi and was pretty crowded but don't worry there is lots of seating available! It was definitely a change up from where we have been going in Europe but we enjoyed it. Waitress spoke perfect English too!",
