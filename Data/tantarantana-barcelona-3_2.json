    "It has been a few days since I returned from my trip to Barcelona and I am still daydreaming about my dinner here. This place is tucked in a small side street and the outdoor tables are in a wide courtyard/plaza shared by other restaurants, a playground, apartments. There was the occasional street performer. Quite picturesque. Ah, and the food........ Simple in its flavors and presentation. But the flavors were so fresh and bold. These were my favorite potatoes bravas and pa amb tomate I had on my trip. There was only one waiter while we were there. But we didn't mind waiting.",
