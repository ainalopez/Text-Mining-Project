    "Its the place where old people go thinking that is where the young people hang out.Food was not great and really not that amazing, especially given the area and the cuisine. One person with us tried the four layer torilla cake, \u00a0which was cold, covered in mayo and otherwise tasteless. I had a normal tortilla with choizo, onion and beans, which was ok, but nothing special.The nice thing was the service ( amazing service by typical Catalan standards). that, along with my tortilla prevented a complete failure (hence 2 stars)We will not be eating there again.",
