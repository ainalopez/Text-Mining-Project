    "Actual tapas in Barcelona for myself and my girlfriend on night 1 of our trip. \u00a0Great small bites...a well done mojito...bi-lingual staff. \u00a0When you are fighting jet lag this establishment will be kind. \u00a0Tapas won't blow you away and it is right across from the entrance from the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana so it can look filled up from the crowd in the street and maybe a small group grabbing an espresso wanders in so don't give up if the place looks slammed...I might not...depends on the time of day.",
