    "This is one of the best places I've ever tried. The food is absolutely amazing. I had a chicken sandwich and you can choose all the toppings. The price is ridiculous. Cannot expect to be that low for what I had. They have different kinds of options. From vegetarian to different kinds of meat. The place is tiny and there's always a lot of people outside waiting. It's worth the waiting. To try!",
