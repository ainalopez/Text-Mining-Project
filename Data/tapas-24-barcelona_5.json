    "Excellent way to cap off a busy day of Barcelona sightseeing, which included Montserrat. \u00a0The wait here ended up being less than 25 minutes. Still, we were herded from one side of the street to the other because \u00a0the queue grew a bit unwieldy, so Tapa 24 moved us to soothe the ire of the Restaurant next door (no wait and very little customers at that restaurant). The food was solid and presented with modern interpretations. \u00a0They have an open kitchen, so we sat, deciphered the menu, placed our orders, and watch the kitchen crew perform their magic from what I would say is a fairly small kitchen. The White Sangria was solid - not watered down but balanced. \u00a0The bikini sandwich, a small tapas, consisted of a cheese, ham, and truffle. Dainty but packed with flavor. Just enough to wet the appetite for more orders to come. Similarly the McFoie Burger was bite size goodness - smaller than a beef slider, with foie gras and foie gras ganache. \u00a0The lamb skewer was well seasoned and a nice protein that I did not see much at other restaurants in town. While there were several other dishes including a tasty beef tartare, that was perhaps seasoned too much with dijon mustard, which was a shame as there was no need to mask or distract from the quality of ingredients.The Red Mullet was a pleaser, it was the last dish of the day, the waiter recommended it, lightly battered, lightly seasoned, you can taste the juicy freshness of the fish in one bite. \u00a0This was one of the better places I dined at while in Barcelona.",
