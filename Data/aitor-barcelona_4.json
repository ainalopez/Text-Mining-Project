    "Stopped in here for lunch on our first day in Barcelona and we were pleasantly surprised! The tapas style buffet was delicious and varied, each item costs only \u20ac1.50 and has a wooden cocktail stick in it - simply keep the sticks and you will be charged accordingly! Delicious fritatta slices, warm chorizo and rich cheeses were just some of the choices available. Washed down with a delicious Estrella and it made for a very pleasant lunch!",
