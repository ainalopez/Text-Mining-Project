    "Wide variety of montaditos to offer - some with very weird combos, like brie and codfish, which somehow seemed to work. We sat at the bar and had a few beers - the servers were friendly and fun to talk to. Food was kinda greasy but the vibe of the place was nice. Their crema catalana was yummy.",
