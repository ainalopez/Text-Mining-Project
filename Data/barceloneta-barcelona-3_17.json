    "I read the reviews on Barceloneta and decided to give it a try. It was our first dinner in Barcelona and I was a little nervous as we were walking toward dinner as we passed by numerous restaurants on the sidewalk with waiters/waitresses trying to pull you in for dinner. My husband and I were thinking, oh we hope that is not our restaurant that we are going to! Luckily Barceloneta is across this busy street and is actually right on the water and is almost secluded making it a very scenic place to have dinner. Service was a little slow in the beginning, we were seated and it seemed like it took at least five minutes for any waiter to acknowledge our presence. However, once we did get the waiter's attention, we were pleasantly surprised by how quick and attentive the service was afterwards. The credit for this goes to the younger wait staff as it seems there is one main person taking orders and then other waiters take over in getting your orders to you. We were impressed by the freshness of our seafood. I ordered the salmon and monk fish carpaccio for a started and my husband ordered the iberico jamon. The jamon was delicious! Also each table gets an order of freshly made toasted tomato bread which is amazing. We asked for another order because our table loved it so much. My husband ordered the seabass tarter which was delicious and I ordered the octopus. My parents ordered the cod fish and tuna steak which were both excellent. Plus the detail and care they take into deboning the fish in front of you was appreciated and entertaining for us since we are used to deboning our own fish. :) All in all we had a great time here and would recommend it as a nice dinner out.",
