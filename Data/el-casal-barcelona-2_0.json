    "El Casal was a great find on a morning my friend and I were looking for a good breakfast before traveling to Madrid in the afternoon. The staff were extremely helpful and patient with our limited Spanish. The food was also very reasonably priced and was delicious. We both got a deal which included cafe, tortilla, toast, and a smoothie for 6 Euros. We were both full and felt like we'd had a home cooked meal and been treated kindly. Would highly recommend. It is very close to many other sites in the area.",
