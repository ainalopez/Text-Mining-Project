    "Came to this place based on Yelp's ratings. Did not live up to its expectations.The food tasted ok, but the ambiance and service was awful. The glass counter displaying the food at the bar made it seem like a cafeteria instead of a restaurant.To top it off, outside street vendors are allowed in the restaurant while you eat to sell you stuff, horrible.",
