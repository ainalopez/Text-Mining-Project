    "Fantastic food and fairly good service. Standout dishes were the braised oxtail with bean puree and the leeks confit with tapenade. The croquettes were also well made and fantastic. We sat at the bar and the service was efficient but could have been warmer.If you're looking for a mix of modern and traditional at reasonable prices you can't go wrong. The food is fresh, creative and most importantly, tastes good.",
