    "I used to live in Barcelona and I recently came back to visit and I still miss this place as much as ever. One of my biggest regrets from living in Spain is that for all the time I lived there, I didn't discover this place until about a month or two before I was scheduled to move home. To this day, I dream about this sandwich. In these dreams, I usually find myself back in Barcelona and end up on a quest to make it to Cafe Viena for the \"ham sandwich\". Believe the hype. There is something about the \"secret\" way they cook the bread (SO CRUNCHY on the outside, yet soft and doughy on the inside) combined with the light tomato spread, the olive oil drizzle and of course, the Jamon Iberico/Jabugo de Bellota, which is the star of the show. The \"flauta d'ib\u00e9ric d.o. jabugo\" certainly lives up to the hype and more. Don't judge a book by its cover, as this place looks so non-descript from the street, you might never know inside they definitely do have my favorite sandwich in the world.5 stars as sandwiches don't get better than this anywhere on earth.",
