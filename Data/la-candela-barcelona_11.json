    "We stopped here for lunch today and it was delicious - asparagus soup, followed by roast beef with a chimichurri sauce. Both were perfect portion sizes, not too heavy on the stomach! Rounded off the meal with a chocolate brownie and mango syrup and a beer for the great price of \u20ac12.50! There is a set menu each day with only a few choices for each course however there was a vegetarian option available. The restaurant is in a lovely setting in a picturesque square, with plenty of outdoor seating. Would definitely visit again!",
