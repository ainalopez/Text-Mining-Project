    "OMG! Anyone who loves to eat a real cheesecake, carrot cake or French quiche must to try lol the pastries at Pudding coffee shop. Honestly, the place is a gem, the food is delicious and the ambiance is outstanding. I love love love it! Staff is very friendly and even if the decor is elegant and sophisticated the prices are not. Which is more than fine by me!",
