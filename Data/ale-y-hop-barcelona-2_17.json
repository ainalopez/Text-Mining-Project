    "Fabulous little beer pub. Try the Edge (local to Barcelona) IPA/APAs. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and speak enough English to make it easy to visit. Its in the middle of the Barri Gotic but not that hard to find. \u00a0Nine taps including and a vegan menu. Llenties i Mill burger was awesome. If you're sick of Estrella and Mahon and want amazing beer and a healthy respite from jamon this is the place to find.",
