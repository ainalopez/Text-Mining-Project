    "Pla\u00e7a Reial meal of the day for two people, 20.40\u20ac , that's right. After eating delicious but expensive tapas at Ca\u00f1ete the night before, an inexpensive and filling lunch was just what the doctor ordered. We each had wine, an appetizer, entree and dessert. Pleased with the outdoor seating next to Gaudi's Lamp posts and enjoying this pleasant square. Just sit back and relax.",
