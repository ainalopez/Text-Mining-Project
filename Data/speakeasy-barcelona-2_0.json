    "Date of Visit 5/17/2011The Short Story:Great restaurant tucked into the back \"storeroom\" of the Dry Martini Bar in Barcelona. Very good menu, fresh, creative and very well executed. Service was impeccable. Atmosphere was just prefect, back room speakeasy, but not really. Fairly upscale. A bit pricey, 167 Euro for two ($210.00US), for six courses with wine, dessert, cheese plate and also with cocktails to start, but worth every cent. Highly recommended.",
