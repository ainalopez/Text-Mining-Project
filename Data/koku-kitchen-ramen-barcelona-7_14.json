    "I was a little tired of Pintxos and tapas one day so I ventured to this little gem. The line out the door is always a good sign. I was alone and the staff squeezed me into a seat without hesitation and started giving me a rundown of what to expect here. The service was great, and the Ramen \u00a0with delightful broth warmed my soul. I also enjoyed their dumplings as well which were cooked perfectly. I was impressed with the whole experience. I'll be back soon.",
