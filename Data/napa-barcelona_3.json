    "I had heard about Napa through some friends and decided to visit during my most recent stay in Barcelona. I arrived with two other friends and was very impressed with the restaurants decor. We ordered a variety of tapas and enjoyed every one of them. The ceviche and tataki salmon were my favorites while my friends preferred others. We had sangria with our food and it was the best we've had throughout our travels in Spain. Everything was reasonably priced and we were surprised at how low our bill was. The staff was very friendly and also went out of their way to suggest places to visit within Barcelona. Overall, service was excellent and the food and drinks were amazing. If you're in Barcelona, you should definitely come by and try out Napa.",
