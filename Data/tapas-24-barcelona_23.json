    "Me and my girlfriend \u00a0arrived to tapas 24 at 9 pm. We where prepared for the queue but where still surprised of the amount of people that where queuing outside of the small restaurant. After about 20 minutes of queuing we where offered a table outside (it was raining at the time). We didn't mind the rain since they had parasols so we gladly took the offer.The waiter came pretty much directly and gave us a menu. We ordered some water and 4 different tapas and the waiter, who appeared to be a bit rushed, still took time to explain the menu even though the place was packed. We ordered patatas bravas, the boneless chicken wings, lamb skewer and the bikini sandwich. Everything was a bit salty but yet delicious, especially the bikini sandwich!Overall tapas 24 serves excellent tapas and I would recommend anyone to come here as long as you are prepared to wait for a while before getting a table.",
