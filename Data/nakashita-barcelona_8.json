    "We came quite late to the restaurant but still had luck to be seated. The waiters were very friendly and it was a blast to watch the cooks prepare the sushi. There was also some live music on that day and everybody was in a great mood.They have a broad selection of sushi, japanese beer and some other drinks. The sushi was really delicious and not that expensive. Too bad that I was not hungrier, or maybe it was good for my wallet ;) The only downside is the location of the restaurant, since most nightlife does not really happen around the Arc de Triompf. It's definitely worth the metro ride though.",
