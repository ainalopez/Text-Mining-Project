    "My favorite place to get seafood-- this is a must each year. The seafood is ALWAYS fresh, as they literally have whatever was brought in that morning and when they run out, they run out. There is little seating, so you may have to wait, but there's so much to look at in the Boqueria that who cares if you wait a bit for a fantastic meal?! Almost all of the seafood is prepared on a flat top with olive oil, garlic and parsley-- no frills. You really can't go wrong here!! Yummmmm-- been coming here for years and the quality is always the best!",
