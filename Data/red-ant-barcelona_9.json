    "Totally reminds me of a hole in the wall place you might find in New York. Small but can fit a lot of people. Lovely and yummy. Be prepared that you may have to wait a bit as it is popular, but it is a hidden gem worth waiting for. The tofu bao and ramen are great vegan options (I think you might have to say no egg, double check on that). This is a great place to go with friends for dinner.",
