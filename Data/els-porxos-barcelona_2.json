    "The eatery my best friend and I wanted to go to closed earlier than advertised, therefore, we came here by chance. It's a fusion place. They spoke little English, however, made by with the few words that I knew and some pre-written cards in Spanish explaining my allergies. They were accommodating to my health concerns and made some awesome recommendations. Waiter was really nice. We had the cold veggie soup which had a unique taste on the vinegar side. We had a veggie rich platter. It was a little too rich on the oil. I felt as though I ate a plate of oil and no actual food. The meal kept me temporarily satisfied. I am not used to eating that much oil in my food. Layout is cute and homely in a traditional sense. In the washroom the lights go out every minute automatically, therefore, turning the light on 3 times was a pain in the a$$.The eatery has a wall full of celebs that have come here to eat, none of which I knew.",
