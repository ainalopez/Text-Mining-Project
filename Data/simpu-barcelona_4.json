    "Simpu is simply the best choice you can make if you want amazingly good and fresh Japanese food right in the middle of the \"Barrio Gotico\": the very center of Barcelona.It's a cozy family owned place that operates also as a take away. The owner, Tomo will be happy to prepare always right away the best sushi I've eaten so far! Oh, and the price is really affordable!",
