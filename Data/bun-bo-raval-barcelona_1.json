    "It depends on what you know about pho. I grew up in California and my mom made it. This couldn't have been further from what I know as pho. However, after 10+ days of pinxtos and tapas, I was yearning for some soup noodles and my Shin ramen ran out. Pork spring rolls had that bubbly, chewy 'imperial' skin. The filling is a bit different - more like an egg roll - with ground pork and glass noodles. The fish sauce was more sour and vinegary. Well, we are in Spain so it was good for where we were. I saw someone else's summer rolls and they looked good - shrimp and all in clear skin. Chicken pho - grilled chicken. Thick noodles that were dried and cooled, but still a tough al dente. The soup was not stewed for hours or had that wholesome chicken essence. Not my kind of pho but it was hot soup noodles. Shrug. I wouldn't get it again. I added a ton of herbs and lime, which I don't normally do. I did love the herb accompaniment. So fresh and large. Because of this, when I burped later, I did feel like I ate pho. HehehService was quick and good so no complaints! I think Vietnamese food is rare here. I see more Chinese and Japanese people and food in Barcelona, which probably would've been the safer option...",
