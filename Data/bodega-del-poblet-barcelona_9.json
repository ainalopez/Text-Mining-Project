    "It was a great experience. It turned out to be a local hang out. It has been a restaurant for 50+ years. We were a party of 18 and a bit hesitant to go in but went in we did. Order the croquetas de albacore \u00a0my kids (13, 6,4) liked them. The cold tapas (potato salad, lobster salad) were delicious. The decor was true Barcelona. It was a bit hot, no AC. But drink enough beer and you'll be fine. They have coca, wines, any drink you can find in a store. Try everything! The mushroom croquetas were great too. All around a great spot.",
