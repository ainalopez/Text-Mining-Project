    "My husband and I checked out this place one evening looking for a more traditional tapas experience. We were not disappointed. It was pretty packed when we walked in, but we were able to find a table. An older guy came to our table. We asked for a menu. No menu, but I used my extremely poor Spanish to get the tapas of the day: pan con tomate, chorizo on bread, fried sardines, and onions, tomatoes, and olives marinated in olive oil. Oh, and some white wine, which they poured from a cask. Everything was simple but delicious; the chorizo was the highlight for me. \u00a0Prices were fair. I'd recommend you stop by here.",
