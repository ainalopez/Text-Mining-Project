    "Caravelle is an attempt to replicate the great London cafes such a Caravan and Lantana. Baked eggs & flat whites all round. And it would get a 3 or 4 star if it wasn't for the service. This morning the waiter literally laughed in my face when I asked for poached eggs to be slightly well done, and blankly refused to ask the kitchen. Service in Spain is notoriously bad, but this is a new low.",
