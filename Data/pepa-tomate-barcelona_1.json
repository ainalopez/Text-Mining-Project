    "Restaurant of typical food from Barcelona, in \u00a0local neighborhood \u00a0(also some great bars here), you must know its there to go there, but now that you read this review you must go.Very typical and delicious food (must try Bulle\u00f1os), service was a bit slow and we waited 20 min to sit in the terrace but the food was totally worth it (best patatas bravas I've tried).",
