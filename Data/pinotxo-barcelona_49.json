    "Rick Steves has made Juan and his little food stand famous. And yes, Juan does love to pose for photos with his trademark thumbs up. He selected our food for us -- chickpeas and \"meat,\" which turned out to be a flavourful stew of some kind. My wife ordered white wine, and Juan just set the bottle in front of her and told her to drink what she wanted! Lots of fun!",
