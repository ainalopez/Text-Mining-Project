    "If you are in Barcelona, you must try Restaurante Montiel! Wonderful food and fantastic service. We loved Montiel so much the first time, we went back again while in Barcelona. The first time we went we were in a group of 7, and the second time it was just my boyfriend and me...both times we had a great experience. Marco is very knowledgeable and will walk you through the menu. When our group ordered drinks, he even brought out some different Whiskeys for us to try, which everyone enjoyed. Although all the food is very good here, the standout dish is the Suckling Pig - it's amazing! Order it and you will not be disappointing. As an added bonus...as nice as this place is, the prices are not outrageous. It's a little hard to find this place, but it's worth the search :)",
