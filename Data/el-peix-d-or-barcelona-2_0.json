    "Don't let the fish-counter look intimidate you; this is insanely fresh seafood. Just choose your pescado or maricosas by weight and preparation and they cook it to order. There is also a selection of ala carte sides and inexpensive wines to choose from. We had gambas planchas, fritas de pescadas and maricosas and the daily special, lobster rice. All were spectacular. This is definitely a secret known by the locals and probably the best meal we had in Barcelona.",
