    "The food is something you would call proper Spanish cuisine.Everywhere you point at the menu is something special, even the simplest tortilla. Recommended all the fresh tapas (tapas del dia)Sangria and pan con tomate are also good.Being such a tourist place, I would have menus in other languages other than the local and it would be a great idea to adopt the sharing table system as many restaurants are doing, it would speed up the line like nothing else does.",
