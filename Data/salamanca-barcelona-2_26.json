    "Great tasting and fresh seafoodAte at a lot of good restaurants in Barcelona, but this was a favorite.The beachfront tables outside were very crowded, so we decided to eat inside in the informal bar area with lots of jamons hanging overhead (there is also a more formal inside room). The server inside was excited to have us as that room was practically empty, and treated us extremely well, giving us free tapas and drinks. The freshness of the seafood, the great taste and service all combine to make this restaurant worth a bit of an upcharge from the others around it.",
