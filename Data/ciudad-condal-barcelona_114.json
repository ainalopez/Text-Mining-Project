    "Let me begin by saying that I was NOT impressed. \u00a0The ambiance was superb but I cannot say that for the food. \u00a0My wife and I came here after going to a few other Tapas places in the area throughout the week because it was given great ratings. \u00a0The place was packed on a Saturday night which is to be expected in its prime location. \u00a0We started off with a pitcher of the sangria which was tasty. \u00a0There is a secret menu with special dishes. \u00a0We tried a couple Shrimp dishes and the prawns were down right disgusting. \u00a0They tasted almost rotten. \u00a0The fried calamari was ok, but I have had better calamari from a hole in the wall bar. \u00a0Overall I was very un happy with the waiter and staff personality and quality of food. \u00a0I would suggest trying out Tapas 24 or La Pepita which are nearby, far superior in my mind",
