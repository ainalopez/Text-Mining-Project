    "If at first the energy and welcoming spirit of the head chef /(slash) bartender /(slash) host does not make you feel privileged and lucky to be witnessing the \"ja ne sais quoi\" feel of this place, just sit back relax and wait five minutes. Try to forget the queue of people waiting for a seat for a second, take in the sounds of the marketplace in the not so distant background, sounding like music in rhythm with the sizzling grill, and chopping of vegetables. Observe this passionate food master and people-person man at work. He seems to handle more than half of the clients on his own, while the remainder of the staff follow his lead and command and occasionally check up on the customers on the far side of the bar. Watching the main guy, you get a unique feeling about this place, a sort of realization that the reason the place is what it is is thanks to old man Juan himself (I say old man in the kindest, fondest interpretation).Now onto the food...it is delicious, prepared fresh in front of you. No set menu here, just a different assortment of tapas that you can choose from. If you are feeling intimidated, ask the head chef to recommend something for you and he will be happy to. He did this for us the first day and it worked out great. I recommend the chickpea tapas plate, perhaps some seafood or the tortilla espanola / potato omelette (egg, onion, potato).We went back to this place the next day. Whether you stop at Pinotxo bar while in Barcelona or not, be sure to check out La Boqueria marketplace, where this tapas bar is located. The marketplace and tapas bar were well worth it and I would love to go back again. Very fairly priced",
