    "First night in Barcelona and enjoyed really great tapas and wine. I apologize for not remembering the names of dishes \"the day after\"...but we loved the lamb skewer with hummus, the cod bites, and the chicken fritters. I loved a cold pumpkin soup with shaved ham and sweet potato chips, but my husband wasn't a fan. It may not be for everyone, but if my description appeals to you -- I recommend it highly! Great bruschetta-like tomato bread seems to come with each meal. Very pleased with a great first night!",
