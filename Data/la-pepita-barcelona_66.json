    "What should I say : great Tapas!Ecpext to pay a little bit more - this is definetly not a low cost joint - but the food is worth it. In case of the calamares I have to tuck a little point of - the sauce it too much, and actually too heavy for the dish. I would have loved it if they would simply served it on the side. :-)",
