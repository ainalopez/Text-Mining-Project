    "In Barcelona, there are more than 500 tapas bars, most probably someone will convince me that in Barcelona there are more than 1.000 tapas bar restaurants. after spending a week in Barcelona we were pleased to find a rather small tapas bar with a unique friendly service and delicious food and wine.At the la pepita we came with a group of 8 collegues from our office. we never had to wait, our glaces were refilled frequently with excellent wine. The room is cossy, with a warm and pleasant \u00a0decor.The service was really outstanding. the service was very helpful and supportive and always with a big smileall by all: outsanting and delicious tapas, outstanding atmosfeer and compared to some other restaurants in Barcelona a reasonable price/person. ( keep in mind that Wine is expensive in Barcelona)I would defenitely go back, and always recommend that people reserve in advaance!",
