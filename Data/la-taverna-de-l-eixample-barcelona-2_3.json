    "This place could be great but there's more than simply food to a restaurant. The food is good but the service is unfriendly and the atmosphere is unwelcoming overall. Also a bottle of water cost almost as much as my sandwhich. Even when we asked for tap water they said they couldn't serve us. Profit over service never works long term. Profit with service works much better.",
