    "Great place to grab a quick bite while visiting Sagrada Familia. All their foods are labeled for dairy, gluten, nuts, and other allergies. the food is pre-prepared and warmed for you, so it's very fast if you need to get to your scheduled tour. The ambiance is very comfortable, with views out the windows of the cathedral. And the price is cost effective!",
