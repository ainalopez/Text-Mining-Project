    "So Yelp isn't as popular as it is in the states but I usually start with it and then go from there. I found this place from yelp and then immediately heard a friend whom recommended me. The place is charming. It's a bit old school (in a good way) and when I was waiting for my table, an old Spanish man was sitting there dining alone. You can tell that this place is authentic simply by that.Of course we came here for the paella, and immediately we ordered to seafood paella. It's approximately 30 minutes to get to us but we did not mind because good food takes time. \u00a0While I was waiting, i ordered the grilled baby octopus which I thought was just ok. But once the paella arrived. I was a believer. Hands down the best paella I had in the history of paella. Come if you love paella. Come if you want old charm. Come. Just come.",
