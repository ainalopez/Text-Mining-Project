    "I'm pesketarian and gluten free so this place was a dream! The menu has an easy chart to follow that tells you what each plates highlights are. I was able to easily navigate GF/oily fish icons to see what I could eat. The food was a good portion. I left feeling full. The flavors were complex and mixed well together. The kale chips were delicious and the kimchee was excellent. // The interior of the place is a must see. The upstairs kitchen window is full of fresh produce. The seats are decorated with Liberty of London prints. All the decor is stone, wood, copper, brass, and it makes the space feel alive! I highly recommend this place. It's the new sister restaurant to Teresa Carles down the street.",
