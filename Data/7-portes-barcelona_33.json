    "I came to this restaurant because a friend recommended the crema catalan here; and he was correct, it was really delicious. \u00a0I had trepidation about getting dinner because reviews on this site, and others, were very split.-yes: stale bread will be put on your table and you will be charged for it-yes: the service left much to be desired, with the grumpy waiter disappearing for great lengths of time.-yes: the paella was WAY too salty. \u00a0I really did not care for it at all. \u00a0I would rate them worse, but it may just be that my American pallet isn't tuned into this dish. \u00a0That said, I've had paella in Andalusia that blew my mind.**[**post-script: I was describing this experience to fellow travelers at a bar. \u00a0Some nearby, possibly biased, Spaniards overheard me and instructed, \"No! \u00a0You should NEVER order paella in the North. \u00a0They don't know what they're doing. \u00a0Blech!\"]The other reason I don't rate this place lower is because it was filled with locals. \u00a0Haha, none of them were ordering paella. \u00a0So, if you do end up going here, I recommend bypassing the \"house dish\". \u00a0Or, just come here for dessert. \u00a0That said, I suspect this is one of those places that exists because it's a tradition for a lot of families, so it gets \"institution status\". \u00a0Honestly, aside from the questionable pintxos bar I drunkenly stumbled into one night, this was the only meal I did not enjoy my entire time in Spain.",
