    "Great place for dinner. Great upscale decor, with both interesting and beautiful artwork on the walls along with nice music. \u00a0The staff is very attentive, friendly, helpful and funny. \u00a0I ordered the spinach salad which came with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese (excellent!) The salmon with pesto came with pasta- excellent as well. \u00a0My husband ordered the cod with mashed potatoes and it was delightful as well. \u00a0He also ordered the \"spicy\" sangria which means it had vodka mixed in -a great \"personality\" drink to get your dinner started off right. \u00a0I highly recommend this place.",
