    "I am from California so I have had my fair share of Mexican food. El Changarrito opened 2 months ago and the food here is second to none. Potentially better than the food you find in California. My family and I had the nachos and ordered a second plate because they were the best we have ever had. The tacos were great as well. We tried the al pastor and the chicken tacos and I can`t say a negative word about either. I wish I would have found this gem earlier. Go there if you are like my family and I and need your mexican food fix!",
