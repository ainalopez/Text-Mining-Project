    "Nestled ever so discretely among the dark avenues of the Gothic quarter of Barcelona resides Sensi Bistro. \u00a0Although a mere 2 blocks away from Sensi restaurant, the Bistro is this small, quaint tapas restaurant lead by a man named Sebastian. \u00a0I ate here during one vacation, twice; twice because the food and service are extraordinary. The first night, a group of five decided to give it a shot, however only three made it to the bistro. \u00a0The other two were waiting for us at Sensi restaurant. \u00a0Hearing us describe in French that they need to come to us, Sebastian offered to go get them. \u00a0He's a nice guy, and one reason you should support this business. \u00a0Once we were all in, he walked us through the tapas options and helped with wine pairing. \u00a0We decided to go with a tasting menu and worked our way through many tapas. \u00a0The pork and the mussels with cream (Sebastian's Grandmother's recipe) are amazing. \u00a0Pair this with a charcuterie starter, tomato bread and a nice wine...it's a great way to spend an evening with friends.I enjoyed the ambiance, the food, the service...just everything -so much I had to go back a second night a week later. \u00a0This time, I brought a different group. \u00a0Everything exceeded my expectations once again.If you are going to Barcelona, you have got to experience Sensi Bistro. \u00a0I suggest you get there no later than 8pm, unless you make reservations.",
