    "Great ambiance and excellent food. I had a salad with my meal and my husband did not, but they brought my husband's meal at the same time as my salad, so we didn't eat our main course at the same time. \u00a0Otherwise, everything was excellent. \u00a0The \"Nebraska\" steak was delicious as well as the spinach salad. My husband had the Pork loin with bread crumbs and fried potatoes (french fries). He loved it. \u00a0The restaurant is really pretty and part of a hotel.",
