    "We are on front of ine of those trendy places. I went with some friends on a Thursday night and it was too crowded, that is not a bad sign. What is bad is that they gave us a small table and I had to sit on the corner, just in the middle of the pass. A place I had to be disturbed by everyone passing behind me to get in place. It is great that they have craft beers, I think beer gets really along with burgers, but I really \u00a0didn't like the glasses for beer, consisting in empty jam jars that make the beer drip by the rims when you tried to drink it. I have to admit that the meat was pretty good though, and the fries were exceptional. Prices were also right. I guess I will be back not in the rush hour, before 9 pm seems a good time. You can also have your sandwich on the bar of you are in a hurry or want to grab a bite alone.",
