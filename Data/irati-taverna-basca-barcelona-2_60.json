    "There is a machine somewhere that churns out the pintxos, and this place is one of them.There's nothing special here, i was at Sagardi last night and, this menu was exactly the SAME. Right down to the drinks and glasses. I felt like the universe had just switched things around a tad, but made the service slower and less interesting.It is what it is. An unimaginative bar with ordinary options.",
