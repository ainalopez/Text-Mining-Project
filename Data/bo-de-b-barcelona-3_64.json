    "I lived right next to Bo de B for three months in Barcelona, Spain - I do not think I would not have survived without it. The style of the resturant is subway meets chipolte. All fresh ingrediants vegtables, you get to pick your meat and it is cooked right on the spot. The sauces are legendary - you are going to want to get them ALL. Every person that I introduced with Bo de B is obsessed. I miss it so much! There is always a line to wait and can take up to 30 mintues but its worth it!",
