    "Food during dinner was amazing! i had a pizza, which would equivalent to a Combination pizza. I went there again the next day for lunch for the lunch specials that they had: Menu A and Menu B. The food was significantly lower in quality than their food available for dinner. The lunch special pastas lacked flavor and the risotto was not fully cooked. To be fair, it would make sense that the quality of the food from the lunch specials were lower compared to dinner due to the significant price differences. I'd like to note that the hostess/server who I think is the owner of the restaurant was very professional and nice, but it did not seem genuine at all. It's like she secretly hated my friend and I. All in all, i'd come here again...for dinner only.",
