    "One of my favorite stops in Barcelona!My last night in Spain was spent nibbling on delicious food on their pleasant little terrace. \u00a0A great bottle of wine coupled with a gourmet salad, hamburger, and fries.I only remember the hamburger to be honest. \u00a0No bun. \u00a0Just meat and cheese. \u00a0The meat had those great crispy edges...oh man.We sat on the terrace and people-watched as the sun went down in my favorite neighborhood.I would love to got back (duh) and sit at the bar next time. \u00a0Just for a different view. \u00a0And to go back to Barcelona.",
