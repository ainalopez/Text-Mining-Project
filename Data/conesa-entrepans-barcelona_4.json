    "So maybe I'm biased because I haven't had a grilled sandwich in a while (gluten free \u00a0for almost 3 years), but this sandwich made me really happy. There was a small line out the door, but it moved quickly. The menu was also available in English, which was helpful. I had a chicken sandwich (pollastre) on gluten free bread for 4.75 euro, and it's a nice sized sandwich. The menu items with gluten were clearly marked. Great value (and great way to balance out a pricy lunch) - will be back next time for a quick, cheap, and tasty meal!",
