    "I love the old charm and history this restaurant has for being one of the oldest restaurants in Barcelona. Make sure you make a reservation on line, it's easier than waiting and they seat you right away even if you're early.We went with a group of 4 and started with a bottle of Tempranillo, the baby grilled squid, anchovies, olives, and steamed mussels and clams. All fantastic and well done. Starting out on light seafood let us indulge in suckling pig and wild boar stew. You must order the suckling pig, suggested by locals that this is the dish they are known for. It was so juicy, tender, falling off the bone, with super crispy skin. The wild boar was good too, they have been making this same dish since 1786!The staff was helpful and very nice, although a bit of a language barrier, but they did the best they could to be as informative. After our dinner we finished with aperitifs, 10 year old brandy and Montserrat liqueurs. All in all was an amazing experience and great food!",
