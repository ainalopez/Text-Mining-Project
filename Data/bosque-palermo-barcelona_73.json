    "I've visited Barcelona a couple of times and have had quite a decent amount of paella. Most have been pretty standard, but this place beats all of the others by a landslide. As with many restaurants in Barcelona, they have outside seating, which is nice because the interior is a bit small. Our waitress didn't speak very much English, to my surprise. At first, she seemed cold, but she ended up being hilarious. She was making fun of all of her customers, \"Everyone only wants paella. WHY PAELLA?!\" I suppose the numerous positive Yelp ratings have attracted many other tourists to this restaurant even though there were more Spaniards dining there than tourists.Within 15 minutes, my friends and I were able to dig into seafood galore. The flavors combined created an incredibly rich and sweet heaven in our mouths. Their portions are very generous at about \u20ac10 per person, which is the cheapest I'd experienced during my multiple trips to the city. If you're in Barcelona, I beg you to try this place. You won't regret it!",
