    "We found this place in the Rick Steves guidebook. The three-course lunch special (including wine) was the main draw, and it's a great bargain. The food is fresh from the market and seems like what you might get at someone's home. The beef ribs dish was tough and veggie sides were just so-so, but you do get big plates full of fairly tasty rustic-style food for a good price. Most of the other diners seemed to be locals.",
