    "This place was right by my BCN apt and since I just had a truly memorable burger in Paris at a local Bistro, I thought about giving this place a try. \u00a0It wasn't all that. I paid $6.25 euro for a small 150g special burger which is made with special sauce (mostly mayo), fried egg and bacon. \u00a0If you've ever had a Bobby's Burger Palace. This place was similar but not nearly as good. \u00a0Skip this place unless you are really craving a burger or on a budget.",
