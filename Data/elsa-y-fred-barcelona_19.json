    "Good food. Sometimes great! Order the duck and foie gras!Great atmosphere, nicely decorated, the girls who work there know more English than I expected, and were very nice. Unlike other reviewers, I did not have to wait long for my food at all! They were timely without making you feel rushed. Some of their dishes were especially tasty! Get out of your shell and try some of the more complicated stuff near the bottom of the menu. That's where the best is. Again, really enjoyed the foie gras and duck! Very good tapas. If you're in town and want to have a bite and didn't make any plans and this is sort of last minute...go here. It may be worth calling in 2 or more hours ahead of time to reserve seating!",
