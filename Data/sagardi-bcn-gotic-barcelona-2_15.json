    "I love this little pintxo bar! In a gorgeous part of the city, we stumbled upon this place by accident and wandered inside. The concept is easy: take a plate and help yourself to any of the pintxos you see. All of them are on toothpicks. When you are done, simply show the waiter your plate, he counts up the number of toothpicks, and you pay 2.25 Euro for each toothpick on your plate. A great deal and a plate of these bad boys makes a filling light meal. There are cold items at the bar but watch for hot ones coming out of the kitchen; they are delicious. It's a lot of bread, though, as most items were served on a slice of bread.Sagardi has a nice outdoor seating area as well that overlooks a pleasant square. At night, you can enjoy the music of local musicians (and be prepared to be asked for a \"tip\" after they perform).",
