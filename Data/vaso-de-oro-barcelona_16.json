    "This restaurant was really good. I suggest this one to everyone, who visits Barcelona, Spain. My friend i , were just curious of a resto, which has good quality of food. Indeed, it had good quality, the tapas were just so delicious! :) Other than that, I\u00b4m not that quite fan of beer, but their beer was just so typically Spanish, and i did not like it that very much. The food though, was great!",
