    "A \u00a0creative yet not over pretentious Japanese cuisine. Had the lunch tasting menu - consisting of 3 dishes + half portion of sushi (which translates into 4 maki & 3 nigiri). From the moment we set foot in the restaurant it seemed to be a promising experience. The restaurant design consists of an open kitchen which can be seen from the entire restaurant space. From the first dish which was a simple miso soup, we could've guessed this is going to be a good experience. The soup was made with fresh vegetables and there was no distinguishable sign of the synthetic miso paste which most Japanese restaurants like to use. Second course was Cold s\u014dmen noodles with grilled aubergine and pork meat - nicely done served in a sauce which seems to contain vinegar, soy and might be other ingredients. \u00a0My main course was the Grilled mackerel marinated with soy sauce which was also nicely done - preserving the fishs taste and gently blending it with the sauce tastes. The sushi was decent. Other than the shrimp nigiri which was a bit tasteless, the rest was in high quality. We drank a cold sake - out of the selection of Japanese sake which the place offers, we took the cheapest one and it proved to be in high quality like the rest of the meal. My partner had the green tea ice team for desert. Again - It was accurately done, not being too sweet and having an accentuated taste. If you read thus far - go there. It's a great experience.",
