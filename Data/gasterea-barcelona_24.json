    "OH DAMN you just got LUCKY! \u00a0If you are looking at reviews for tapas and a GOOD TIME then you have found the spot. \u00a0This place is great but can be packed - be ready to stand and order over the lucky people who have scored a seat at the bar (odd at first but not intimidating). \u00a0There are shallow standing tables against the wall in this skinny but long/deep establishment. \u00a0The service is great, the atmosphere is fun (we met people from 3 different countries) and the food is great! \u00a0If you only speak/read English then get a menu it has the translations. \u00a0From the cheese to the anchovies to the peppers this place is solid. \u00a0 The next time we are in Gracia we will definitively be back at least once if not more.",
