    "I normally don't write reviews, good or bad, but have to say, this was probably the worst meal i have ever had. \u00a0I ordered the fried duck egg with plankton and it was horrendous--a green vomitous sauce, an old egg and very fishy fried plankton. \u00a0It was totally disgusting and obviously old ingredients. \u00a0Their pan con tomate was also the worst i had in Spain, mere thin crusts of stale bread. \u00a0My husband ordered the bone marrow with quail eggs and it was very expensive, flavorless and not hot. \u00a0The only good thing i can say is i lost my appetite for the entire day and probably lost a little weight as a result. \u00a0This is pretentious horrendous food and despite the other reviews, the other people there were all tourists. \u00a0Only tourists could tolerate or not know about this disgrace to good taste.",
