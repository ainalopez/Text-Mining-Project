    "Gusto is an Italian restaurant that works very hard to look Italian: waiters will say \"prego\" and the menu is in Italian. Most of the stuff is Italian, too. Upscale decoration, but busy and noisy. Not especially spacious, neither. Maybe it's because I went on a Friday night, but it was hard to get noticed by the waiters.I really enjoyed their fish and they have fire ovens for pizza. Their beef carpaccio was passable, but not especially good. Id come here if I'm around, but that'd be the only reason.",
