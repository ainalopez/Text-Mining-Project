    "This by far is one of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona!! It is a little difficult to find (aka on a side street); however, it is well worth the travel. For under $10, you can get an empanada, main course, dessert, and beverage. It was absolutely delightful. The food was way better than than the price tag (not the best), but for sure delicious. My friend ordered the vegetable lasagna (4.5/5) and brownie (4.5/5) and I ordered the carne empanada (good), spinach ravioli with pesto (dynamite), and dulce de leche (splendid) And can I comment on the staff please? For those with weak spanish skills, they can also speak excellent English and they are incredibly patient, welcoming, and attentive. Some of the best service ever! If I had more time in Barcelona, I would definitely return!",
