    "If you enjoy tapas, La Bodegueta Proven\u00e7a is a great place to sample the finest tapas Barcelona has to offer. Since my friend ordered everything, I don't exactly recall what was ordered but the white wines that we ordered were excellent. In particular, I remember this black rice dish being delicious, along with the fried calamari. You can't really go wrong with their menu as everything that I tried was tantalizing to my mouth. It was also nice that this restaurant was away from the touristy areas. Just be careful of the times that they are open as we almost missed their lunch time. This place is somewhat pricey but definitely worth the investment for a gastronomic experience in Barcelona.",
