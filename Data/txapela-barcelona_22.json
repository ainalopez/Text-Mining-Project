    "Open late, Txapela is part of a chain of Euskal Tabernas (Basque bar) serving pintxos (Basque canap\u00e9s). We stopped in for a nightcap and snack on the way back to our hotel.Like the fish in a sushi bar cold case, you can look at all the pre-made options (yelp.com/biz_photos/UctY\u2026) or order from the picture menu (yelp.com/biz_photos/UctY\u2026) They have something like 50 varieties to choose from. We ended up trying a salmon pintxo (yelp.com/biz_photos/UctY\u2026) which tasted fine. Good for a quick bite if you're walking by, but not destination worthy if you're just visting.Fun atmosphere late at night. The bar guy was very friendly.",
