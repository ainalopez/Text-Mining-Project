    "Place: lovely charming place full of authenticity and live soft musicProducts: I had a mix of cheese and cured meats of excellent quality. Service: warm and friendlyPrice: very good value for money; about 14 euros for the mix if I remember correctly Overall I had a very pleasant evening. Perfect for a relax business dinner, a romantic dinner or a small get together with friends as they have different rooms and table settings.",
