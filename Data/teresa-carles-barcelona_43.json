    "Delicious food, good portion sizes, beautiful interior, fast service, and all vegetarian! Myself and my three dinner mates were all pleased with our dinner here. \u00a0Glad we made a reservation online ahead of time as they were really busy. \u00a0Looked like a lot of locals were eating here compared to the other vegetarian restaurants we ate at during our trip.",
