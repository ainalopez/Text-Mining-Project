    "So so good!!The traditional tomato and oil on bread was some of the best I had while in Barcelona! \u00a0I enjoyed my meal of green rice with cod cheeks and the waitress let me know that this was one of her favorite meals at the restaurant but only after I had finished it. \u00a0My dining partner had the langoustines which were delicious and very fresh tasting. \u00a0We were in the mood for something light for dessert. \u00a0I had the mandarin sorbet which tasted as if they had grated some fresh rinds onto the sorbet...perfect and light. \u00a0My dining partner had the Greek yogurt which was almost looked like a marshmallow as they had slightly br\u00fbl\u00e9ed the top. \u00a0Very creamy. \u00a0Overall, I would come back here anytime I was in Barcelona as it was not too expensive but just as delicious and maybe more so than the pricier meals I've had!",
