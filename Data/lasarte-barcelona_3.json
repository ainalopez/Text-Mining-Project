    "The food kept on coming! \u00a0I wish I wrote this sooner so all the courses were fresh in my mind. \u00a0Thankfully the restaurant gives you a menu so you can play along at your table. \u00a0Went to Barcelona as part of our honeymoon and made the reservation well in advance. \u00a0Staff was so knowledgeable and attentive. \u00a0No language barrier to English at all!We both got the tasting menu and went with our waiter's recommendation on a bottle of red wine. \u00a0It paired nicely with most of the food - and if it didn't, I was so obsessed with what I was eating that I didn't notice. \u00a0Everything was beautifully presented, even the 5 different types of butter!I wish I could articulate the food better but the photos speak for themselves.Bottom line, if you're looking for an upscale dining experience with a touch of whimsy, this is the place.",
