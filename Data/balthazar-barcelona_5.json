    "A first class disaster...Where to begin? Our waiter didn't know what a gin and tonic was. Service was horrendous - like a factory assembly line, the waiter literally threw the silverware down on the table. Fried calamari was like bits of fried garbage - tasteless and gross. Tomato and mozzarella salad tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for a week. Chicken entree was dry and rubbery, had to be sent back after attempting to chew first piece. Pork entree tasted fine until cutting into the raw piece, then felt sick for rest of the night. Thankfully they took it off the bill. Honestly, the check couldn't come soon enough. Avoid this place at all costs.",
