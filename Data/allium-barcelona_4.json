    "If I can give a zero star rating, I would. \u00a0I don't know who posted the other reviews but I need to re-calibrate this yelp rating.I yelped this restaurant and decided to give it a go... I should've known better when there was only a couple of reviews.Here's my experience. \u00a0This place is down one of the main streets off of La Rambla. \u00a0When I walked in there were only 2 customers sitting a the bar. \u00a0No one else.What I ordered:1 Glass of the house red wine1 order of PaellaRed wine was nothing special.The Paella sucked. \u00a0I'll upload the picture later but about a quarter way through I asked the waiter if this was a typical paella. \u00a0He said it was typical from the Valencia region of Spain. \u00a0Regardless of where it's from, the rice in paella should be cooked. \u00a0It was very undercooked and only 5 pieces of seafood in the dish. \u00a0A couple of small shrimp and a couple of mussels. \u00a01 of the mussel was not even cooked.I left still hungry and didn't finish the dish. I left it about 3/4 full. As I left the restaurant, the staff did not even acknowledge me. \u00a0No Thank you, no goodbye.If you're a tourist, AVOID this place!!",
