    "I have been here two times for dinner and one time to get some beers. It is as good as it gets. The dumplings are delicious and I recommend to get also the duck. Prices are on the spot and the craft beer selection is also really good. A little hustle is that it gets really really crowded so expect to have a line. Decoration is also really nice and service is gentle and it looks they are having fun with what they are doing, a rara avis in Spain table service. I got to know them because this summer I attended to a craft beer festival in Poble Nou and they were in charge of one of the food trucks, the red ant. It seems that its their brand for food to go, that is close to the main restaurant. \u00a0I am a fan of Mosquito, and at least you have to try it!",
