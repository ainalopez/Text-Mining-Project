    "Hi! I have been around this area many many times and I found La Trini today (not sure how long they've been there lol). Ambiance is beautiful and gives a very sort of art/marketplace/bar feeling which is quite unique. We got a table for 2, on a Saturday night, easily and with no queue (big plus). The waiter recommended the crispy chicken with secret sauce and the calamari andalusian style for starters so we decided to take those. The menu is rather extensive so there's something for everyone! Both were really good and soft in the mouth, mild taste! Then for main, my friend ordered the burger with foie and I ordered the tempura with foie and egg. Her burger was alright, very nice taste but slightly bit overcooked, good portion and nice fries; my tempura was something else completely: DELICIOUS!! The egg and the foie fit really nicely into the dish and really beautiful presentation, perfectly cooked!! If I have to say something \"negative\" of this dish it's that the portion is rather big - slightly less tempura veg would make the dish perfectly balanced!! Price was really okay and the staff were friendly and kind so I definitely recommend coming here!! One more comment: I wish they had bigger bottles of water... Cheers!",
