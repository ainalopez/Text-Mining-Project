    "As good as it gets. \u00a0Truly exceptional meal.Walked in with no reservation, scanned a very small menu and struggled to communicate with the owner about having a vegetarian meal prepared. \u00a0She was welcoming, accommodating, and earnest in her efforts to assure me that I would be taken care of.Artsy and eclectic in decor, the design was original and surprisingly homey. \u00a0We were completely blown away by our meal. \u00a0Boyfriend went with a tasting menu and was served an exquisite sample of starters so lovely in presentation. \u00a0From a variety of octopus, melting brie, shrimp and a variety of other starters, each portion was, what he calls, \"Iron chef-like.\" \u00a0His fishbone collar was the best piece of cooked fish he has eaten (he prefers sushi) and the black and white dessert was so perfect and decadent.I enjoyed a beautiful dish of black rice with vegetables and a parmesan broth. \u00a0It was rich, nutty, perfectly cooked, and unlike anything I have ever had. \u00a0We loved everything about this meal: \u00a0the service, the food, the wine, the plating, the dessert and simply the surprise of it all-- it amazes me that their prices were so affordable. \u00a0Unforgettable meal, we are eager to return!",
