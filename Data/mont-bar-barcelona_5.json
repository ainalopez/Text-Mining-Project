    "It is a nice looking bar. Just didn't think the food was that great. We had a cheese plate, some vegetable dumplings, a small hamburger thing, smoked tuna, anchovies, some other stuff. Maybe it was an off night. I generally do not criticize service, especially where accidents happen - everybody makes mistakes. They charged us for two plates of a dish we only got one of, and they didn't bring us another dish that was on the bill. They were not rude at all when I brought it to their attention, and in fact the waiter apologized and corrected it immediately on the bill. So in my view, that is good service. Still, things were a little slow for us and they didn't seem very busy.",
