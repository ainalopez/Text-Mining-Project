    "Saw this place on a travel show just before we left USA and it happens to be very near our hotel. \u00a0I popped in by myself while the hubby was at an event, and they were most welcoming, to even a single lady. \u00a0The man at the bar was very attentive and promptly handed me a menu, took my order, provided the sandwich and the bill in a smooth pleasant manner.I had the Mark Bittman favorite sandwich and I loved it. \u00a0( the flauta pernil d'ib\u00e9ric d.o. jabugo. The flauta is a flute -- the name for a bread that we might call a small sub, or a long roll). Iberico ham is a Spanish salt cured ham. It is produced exclusively from black Iberian pigs fed on a diet of acorns. \u00a0The bread is rubbed with tomato and is crunchy, crispy goodness.The Vienna \u00a0salad was served in a plastic sealed container with a plastic fork, which was bit disconcerting. I guess this is a fast food kinda place, in a charming venue?The coffee came with complimentary cookies.I will go back and get a few for plane ride home!",
