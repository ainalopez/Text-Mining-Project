    "great neigborhood restaurant - everyone eating there knew the owners and the owners knew them. \u00a0Food was great tasting and large portions. \u00a0Best of all the bill was extremely reasonable, even with some drinks. \u00a0It's a real happening place.Almost forgot to mention this. \u00a0We showed up without a reservation and the place was packed. \u00a0we went into the restaurant to get on a waiting list, but there isn't any. \u00a0One of the locals instructed us onthe custom for getting a seat at the counter - when folks have finished eating and have paid their bill, hover and swoop in to get a seat. \u00a0It was great sitting at the counter and we struck up conversation with the locals, who were very welcoming. \u00a0Service was quick and they paid attention if you wanted another glass of wine or needed anything else.",
