    "Exceptional restaurant that is certainly top of its league~ We had to wait for our table of five, so we went to La Cava for a drink until our server came to retrieve us. \u00a0La Pepita was a hot spot! \u00a0The atmosphere was hip and relaxed at the same time. \u00a0The servers were friendly and patient as we oohaah over the unusual menu.We had the stewed beef cheek which was incredibly tender. The gambas tapa was very flavorful. \u00a0You can't go wrong with any of the pepitas either. \u00a0Just as we thought the meal couldn't get any better, the ostres...the corn icecream was an amazing surprise. Mmmm...will be back again soon.",
