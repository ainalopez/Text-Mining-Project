    "This was definitely a 5-star fine dining experience! \u00a0We passed on the tasting menu and ordered a la carte, but we got the wine pairings with each course. \u00a0Brilliant - the sommelier was excellent, especially considering that he was communicating with us in English. \u00a0I loved my crawfish \"paella\" - a nontraditional version to be sure, but by far the most flavorful rice dish we had in all of Spain. \u00a0Fish for both main courses was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and my \"Trip to Havana\" dessert - consisting of rum cake, mojito granita, and a frozen chocolate cigar that actually managed to have a delicious tobacco flavor - was out of this world. \u00a0I am generally a bit skeptical of anything in the \"molecular gastronomy\" arena, but Moo exceeded all of my expectations. \u00a0Well done.",
