    "Quite decent actually. Those who have been to Barcelona probably know that finding a good place to eat can prove rather tricky, as most places are usually fully booked or are tourist traps that serve bad food. Having stayed right next to Placa d'Espanya I went on a hunt for a nice place to have dinner, and one which would not set me back a fortune. Found Bodega Monumental, which has been around for close to a hundred years apparently. The food is very decent, nothing fancy but delicious. The menu is fairly small, a couple of Tapas, Seafood, homestyle delicacies. Wine list looks good as well, the red one I had was great (can't remember the name unfortunately) as well as the house wine. Staff looks like they came straight off the Love Boat TV show, which is fun to watch. They do serve you quickly and are friendly. Had a few Tapas here, which were all really good. From what I could see there were no complaints from other people, everyone was enjoying their time. Not too shabby at all!",
