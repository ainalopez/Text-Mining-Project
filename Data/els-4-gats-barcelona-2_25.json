    "Beautiful space, wonderful history - it's worth coming by for a coffee or glass of wine but I don't recommend staying for dinner. The food was fine (we had croquettes, pumpkin ravioli, scallops and monkfish) but the service (lack of) tainted the experience. We ordered a bottle of wine and not once were our glasses refilled. No one came by to ask how are meals were. I had to get my own bread at one point. We watched two couples leave before ordering because of the poor service. We would have liked to have dessert (we were celebrating a milestone birthday, which we told them) but by this time we just wanted to leave. Very disappointing experience.",
