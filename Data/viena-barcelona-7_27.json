    "Looks can be deceiving. Cafe Viena looks like any other tourist trap along Las Ramblas. And I'll admit I only stopped here based on Mark Bittman's 'best sandwich in the world' claim to fame. Glad I did - I only had a flaut\u00ed (a mini flauta) to tie me over until dinner. It was far tastier than the flauta I had the previous night and a great deal too - flaut\u00ed and coke: 5.45\u20ac. I think best sandwich in the world is going a bit too far, but I do think it's worth the stop if you need a little something to tie you over while walking around!",
