    "This place has the best bocadillos Ive ever had in Spain. I went twice during my 3 day visit and ordered the chicken and salmon. I preferred the chicken because they grilled the chicken in front of you so it was hot in their warm house made bread. Unbelievable sandwich experience. \u00a0Highly recommend.",
