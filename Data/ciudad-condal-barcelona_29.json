    "As a tourist, is not always embassy to know where to eat best, that's why I'm going to write my review in English... I had to come a second time before leaving Barcelona. Food is really really good, nothing fancy the place has a lovely classy feeling and decoration to it, and it's also full of locals, shoppers and business people alike. I tried a bit of everything, you can really enjoy a mix of their montaditos (small slice of baguette bread with different toppings). My favorites were montadito with piquillo pepper/tuna/anchovies (so good), also with beef tenderloin (exquisite), tapas de pulpo a a gallega (roasted octopus with pumpkin pur\u00e9e). And don't forget your jar of sangria! Service is fairly nice and I will definitely come back when in Barcelona.",
