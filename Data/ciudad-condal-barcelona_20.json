    "This place es muy delicioso!!! The line was so long, but if you keep your eye out for bar seating, you can swoop in and get a seat there instead. I love that some tapas are displayed (some may not be on the menu). There was one with sweet cheese and pineapple and I was obsessed. Honestly, everything is amazing. The mini burger...yeah, that's mini. Smallest burger I've ever seen, it was adorable. Everything is reasonably priced. We just kept ordering until we were full and we definitely over predicted the bill. Enjoy tu comida! Next time I'm visiting, I shall be back.",
