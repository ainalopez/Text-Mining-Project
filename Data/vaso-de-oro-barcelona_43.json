Luckily, we found a table in the back and ordered the following: 1) Foie Gras with Steak 2) Russian Salad3) Tuna Salad4) Chorizo5) Calamari 6) Serrano peppers Everything was great but my favorites were the foie gras with steak, russian salad and chorizo. I would recommend getting their beer as well.",
