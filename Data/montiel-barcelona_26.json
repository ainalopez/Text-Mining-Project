    "I visited Montiel after researching online and seeing its rank and positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Despite my high expectations, it managed to exceed it. When we visited, there was a football (soccer, for US and Canada) game going on so it was not very busy. But this did not affect the quality of food and service we received. The waiters were very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu they offer. The food was impeccable - especially the suckling pig! Very crispy skin and the meat is tender, juicy and flavorful. We also ordered duck and ravioli, both of which were also superb. I am typically a picky foodie but I have nothing to complain about with this restaurant. The food and service is top notch and definitely up to par to high-end fine dining.monkeyseemonkeyfeast.blo\u2026",
