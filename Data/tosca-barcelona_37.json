    "Great location for a quick bite before a show. All of the tapas are a good size for sharing. For 5 people we ordered about 8 dishes and everyone was full. The dishes are a little different from typical tapa places and seem to have a little bit of an Asian influence. It was a nice change of pace!Recommendations: Salmon with bok choy, sirloin, veggie lasagna",
