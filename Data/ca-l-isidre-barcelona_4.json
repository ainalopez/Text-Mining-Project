    "This was probably my favorite restaurant in Barcelona. The food and service were out of this world. Our waiter was an absolute charm. \u00a0They even have an original Miro! I would highly recommend this restaurant to any one in \u00a0Barcelona. \u00a0 Reservations are strongly recommended. \u00a0It is located in El Raval.",
