    "Is it fair to give a place a review five years after visiting? Maybe not, but when you're STILL thinking about that restaurant five years later, it might be worth letting people know how much you loved it!Grab a glass of rioja or a cerveza, grab a plate, and settle in to taste a wide array of unique, pretty, and delicious little pintxos. Maybe not the best option for picky eaters or those with allergies, as it can be hard to predict what, exactly, you're biting into - but this is a great stop for people who are feeling adventurous and want to try as many different flavors as they can. I hope to visit Barcelona again someday to see La Sagrada Familia completed, and you can bet this place is at the top of my \"must visit\" list!",
