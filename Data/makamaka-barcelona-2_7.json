    "This place is hopping with twenty something's. \u00a0It's a boisterous crowd, mostly seated outdoors so come when the weather is nice. \u00a0 Burger Bar best describes this place. \u00a0 Burger was good but not great. \u00a0Cooked only one way - they don't ask how you want it. \u00a0 Fries are OK. Limited beer selection. \u00a0 But overall a fun place with a good vibe.",
