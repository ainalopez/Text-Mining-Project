    "Found this place online when looking for gluten free restaurants in Barcelona. Walked 35 minutes to get there and found it closed. The owner gave some advice but then said in Spanish that we could wait. Wait for what? Well, turns out he reopened earlier for us.We asked why the owner opened a gluten free restaurant. Perhaps he was gluten free? It turns out that he has 2 daughters whom are gluten free! Also, he is from Italy where gluten free is very much more known and he wants to raise awareness in Spain.After 20 mins we got our food. I had the (gluten) pasta and it was tasty, but not amazing. It is the gluten free food which stands out though and with that said, I think Il Piccolo is quite unique, cute and interesting little Italian restaurant.",
