    "we were walking around in the eixample neighborhood, along the pg. de gracia when my stomach made a rumble signaling that it was dinnertime. \u00a0i was really craving chicken, since i hadn't had much of this protein since arriving in spain (ham, pork, and tuna were very prevalent, from what i could see). \u00a0after walking around and perusing several menus, we saw that this restaurant offered chicken! \u00a0winner, winner, chicken dinner!we ordered the following:+two racions of bread (\u20ac2,42) - yep, they charged for bread! \u00a0\u20ac1,21 per person. \u00a0this was just your typical white bread, not the catalan-style bread that i was accustomed to having at most other restaurants, but we were hungry, so we ate it!+1/2 litre of water (\u20ac2,64) - another semi-expensive bottle of cold water, but much appreciated since we'd been walking around under the hot sun all day (and i'd been drinking lukewarm-slightly cool water from my water bottle).+glass of white wine (\u20ac2,09) - hubby's glass of vino blanco, i had a sip and it was cool and crisp with tones of apple.+mixed green salad (\u20ac6,82) - typical salad with greens, carrots, and tomatoes, nothing to write home about, but the fresh veggies with light dressing were the perfect starter to our meal.+rotisserie chicken (\u20ac11,44) - yep, this was a whole chicken alright, a smaller one, but a whole chicken. \u00a0we really had to work for this, and hubby did most of the carving, handing me slices of chicken until i was full. \u00a0the chicken was very fresh and very juicy, clearly served right out of the rotisserie oven! \u00a0definitely worth the long walk, and the wait for this main! \u00a0but i'm glad that we split it since i could not have finished this on my own!we sat outside and enjoyed our dinner al fresca, although there were quite a few smokers around us....very typical for europe. \u00a0service was standard, very little english was spoken, but pointing to an item or two on the menu was all that the staff needed to get the ball rolling.aside from the smoke, we had an otherwise enjoyable late supper in a quieter part of town, which was a nice change for us. \u00a0this restaurant definitely had nice ambiance and is a good date night spot.",
