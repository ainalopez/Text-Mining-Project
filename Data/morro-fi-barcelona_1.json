    "Ok Ok, I am guilty, I love vermouth, and I think this passion is going wild. Yesterday after the tasting I looked for a really good place to make our sunday's vermouth, and I find this place after one of my yelp friends checked in. So that was my mission today, to get to this tiny cozy place before the vermouth rush hour. Mission impossible, we got there late and there was a line, but these guys took care of the line pretty quickly. w got 2 house vermouth and some chips. All together 6,60 Euros, that's a pretty competitive price. The chips were wonderful, really thick and seasoned with a vinegar and red pepper sauce. The vermouth, the king of the party was really good, not too sweet and with the right amount of bitterness that I want at the end of the taste. Going to one of this really trendy and crowded places one starts to think if the should get a bigger place, or if part of their hipe is coming because of that. I think they should keep the small place, because is the best way to keep the essence of the whole experience. I will try to be there before 1,30 pm, let's say noon and see how crowded it is.",
