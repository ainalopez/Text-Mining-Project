    "I stumbled into this place for lunch after a hot afternoon of wandering and shopping. \u00a0I was hoping for a nice glass of wine and much needed A/C, but the food was out of this world. \u00a0I had the soft egg with prosciutto, steak tartar and oyster tapas. \u00a0All were delicious. \u00a0Presentation was beautiful. \u00a0Even the bread was better than other restaurants. \u00a0I highly recommend it. \u00a0The portions are on the smaller side so if you are more than one person you may need double orders if you want more than a few bites each.",
