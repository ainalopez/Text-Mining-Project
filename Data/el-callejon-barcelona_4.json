    "Tourist trap. Friendly waitresses who were nice and attentive. The food was completely sub par:you're better off going to the bookstore, finding a Spanish cookbook and doing anything on the menu yourself- you're guaranteed it'd taste better on your first try than here.We had Th entrec\u00f4te and chicken. They tasted cheap and like they were cooked that morning and left out all day,Save your money and go anywhere else.",
