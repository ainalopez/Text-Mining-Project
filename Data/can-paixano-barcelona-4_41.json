    "Super cute sandwich place tucked away on a side street in Barcelona near the water. Apparently rose goes with ham sandwiches? I didn't know that but I wasn't complaining...We got there pretty early, 12:00 for lunch and there were definitely people in there but not nearly as crowded as some of the reviews. 2-4 euro will get you a great sandwich and another 2 euro will get you a glass of rose...which you must get if you go to this place because it's just the deal.Everything was really good- although a little fatty for my taste. My husband wasn't complaining, though. He finished any parts I didn't like. Great place, definitely will go back and recommend to friends. Go early!",
