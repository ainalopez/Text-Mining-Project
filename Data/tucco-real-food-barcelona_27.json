    "I can say that the food here is beyond amazing but that would be selling it short, I could say that it was the most food we got for the money we spent in all of Barcelona but that would also be selling it short. The man known as Juan dips in and out of conversations seamlessly while catering to all the tables in the restaurant to make sure everyone is not only ok but are happy! His food skips the digestion stage and simply hugs your soul. The Ravioli were little pockets of fluffy love pillows with yuminess. I am actually salivating while typing this. Juan uses his heritage mixing Argentian and Italian food in a unique tasty way. Thank you Juan for showing us an amazing time TWICE! I hope i can show you a food experience as amazing as you provided me one day, I will wait to see you in NEW YORK!!!Gracias Amigo!",
