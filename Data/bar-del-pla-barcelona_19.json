    "Sorry but I really don't get what the hype is all about? I walked in on a Thursday around 1pm and the place was practically empty - ok by me. I sit at the bar and get served a mediocre glass of red wine and water. I ask for suggestions on the menu, the service is not friendly, in fact they seem to hate their lives. Whatever I'm from NY I'm used to this. I ordered the pan con tomate, the fried artichokes and the chicken cannelloni (I can't eat seafood). All were totally average. Yes, the tomato bread it good, but its bread with tomato sauce - if you like pizza you're going to like this. No surprise that tourists rave about it. Also this place isn't cheap so I don't know where the rest of you were eating to compare it to, but 25 Euros for 3 tapas and a glass of wine is not that great.All I'm saying is I hope there's better food out there and I don't recommend this place. Seems like a tourist trap that everyone is falling for.",
