    "I've never seen a line for food in Europe. I see them in the US and Asia all the time but when I read that people line up for blocks/hours to eat at this ramen place, I had to try it. The gyoza was pretty good, though if you live in the US, you'll get better there. But the ramen was seriously delicious - I got the miso flavor. The broth was good but the meat and noodles were the star. And yes, people line up for this place before it even opens. I went on a Saturday night and got there at 8pm (opens at 8:30) and waited for 90 minutes for a party of 2. Don't go with a large group unless you're okay watching the smaller ones pass you by.",
