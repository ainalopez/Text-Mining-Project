    "Very classy place with amazing fusion food which is almost served tapas style but the plates are a little larger than what I've had at most other tapas bars. \u00a0The restaurant is beautiful, the staff very attentive and helpful. \u00a0We ordered a number of different plates, all completely different and all delicious. \u00a0You could wear shorts with a nice polo shirt but you'll be the only person there in shorts most likely.",
