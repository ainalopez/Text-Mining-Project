    "We wanted a proper breakfast. \u00a0Not one of those European breakfasts of rolls and crackers (that most hotels seem to offer). \u00a0This place looks like a bar, but they have umbrella tables (plus I think booths inside, though we didn't go inside). \u00a0The food was OK. Outdoor seating was nice except smoking is allowed in Spain, and folks at neighboring tables were doing it. This is a problem everywhere. \u00a0You don't realize how successful the anti-smoking campaign has been in the US until you go to Europe and it seems everywhere someone is smoking like a chimney. \u00a0It's actually obnoxious by American standards. \u00a0I guess Europeans don't get lung cancer???Anyway, reasonable prices (for Europe) and decent food. \u00a0I would come here again.",
