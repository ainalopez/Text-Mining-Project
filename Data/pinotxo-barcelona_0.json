    "Let me preface this review with stating that I am SO in LOVE with Spain. And out of all the places I ate at in Spain, I love this little stall in the Mercado de la Boqueria the best. I was only able to eat at Pinotxo once, for breakfast, on my 2nd to last day in Spain and up until now, months later and writing this review I am totally daydreaming of that delicious cronut-like pastry I had for my breakfast that morning. Xuixo (I think pronounced \"chu-cho\") are these delicious, custard/cream-filled, cronuts covered generously in sugar and are the most amazing pastries you've ever had in your life. (Trust me, I eat a lot of pastries.) I ended up having one at the stall and ordering another 2 to take back to my AirBnB place for an afternoon snack or post-tapas dessert. Order a latte with it and you're golden. Come early, I heard these little taste-of-heaven pastry run out very quickly. (Probably because of people like me that order a few to take with them... ah well. Can't blame a girl.)I wanted to eat here again, perhaps for lunch, but just couldn't make it out due to all the other places I wanted to see and eat at. But I highly recommend this place for anyone going to Barca. Go as often, for breakfast specifically, and you'll never regret it. Warning: this place is really tiny. I went into the mercado everyday to grab a snack and just because I loved open-space markets like these (it's really beautiful, bustling, and colorful) and Pinotxo was packed with people lined up waiting for their turn for seats each and every time I walked by. I wish I could say more about lunch/dinner but breakfast was the only time I was able to go. Enjoy! And thank me later :).",
