    "Strolling along La Rambla, we were getting hungry and came across Wok to Walk, and we're so glad we decided to check it out! We've spent a number of years in Singapore and have tried a number of versions of fried rice and noodles. Believe it or not, even as vegetarians, the taste has varied a lot. The one we had at Wok to Walk was one of our favorites!The basic rice/noodles come with veggies and egg, and you have the option to add meat/seafood/more veggies. We had both rice and noodles, with toppings of tofu, spinach, pineapple and mushrooms. We tried the Black pepper sauce for one, and the Hot Asian Sauce for the other. Both the sauces were very flavorful! The food was a little on the greasier side, but hey, its fried rice and fried noodles. There is also an option to replace rice/noodles with veggies. There is not a lot of place to sit - people usually take out. We were there at peak dinner time and people kept pouring in and out. We waited 5 mins and were able to grab a couple of seats at a table. Definitely recommend this place!",
