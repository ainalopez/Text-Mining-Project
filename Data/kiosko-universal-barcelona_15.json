    "Apparently, it's never too early for beer and seafood in Barcelona. I've never seen that combination of drink/meal for breakfast anywhere else..I was hoping to try El Quim, but we chanced upon this little gem of a food stand instead. Anyway, it seemed a better option than stumbling around La Boqueria in search of an unknown location. Based on the reviews, it seems that the price is a little more reasonable here - my family of four had a nice, filling breakfast for 47 euros and change - but the menu selection is just as broad as El Quim's.We had the:1) mixed seafood (razor clams, crawfish, calamari, mussels, and shrimp)2) mixed vegetables (asparagus, carrots, mushrooms, and green pepper)3) mixed mushrooms (sorry, i don't know my mushrooms)4) potato omelette (this is pretty self explanatory)The food is super fresh and prepared on the flat top in the center of the kiosk, right in front of your eyes. I think the best part of the meal is watching the chef work his magic.. that and spying on what other customers are ordering. (: The service is friendly but not overbearing, and for those of you who don't speak Spanish, there is at least one waiter who speaks English. If you are at La Boqueria, this is definitely not a place you want to miss!",
