    "Fantastic local bar. When I came in around 18:00 it was almost empty. Only a few locals and the very friendly bartender. I had some beer and some olives and sat listening to jazz and blues and rock and roll. I even helped settle a dispute over when the Doors had formed(thank you Wikipedia) around 20:00 I orders the tapas combinado, which was sliced off of the meat hanging at the end of the bar. Excellent. Then it started to fill up. Locals and touristas alike crowded in and I felt lucky to have a stool at the bar already. Rollo the bartender had been talking about his time in Texas and I was treated to some shots of Bourbon to celebrate my return home tomorrow. I had tried to come in for lunch at noon and they were as closed as can be. Glad I was persistent, I would have missed this place if not for yelp. \u00a0Best deal in town!",
