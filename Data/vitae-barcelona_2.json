    "This place is great! The service is by far the best I have ever gotten in Barcelona and I have lived here for a year. The waiters are not only kind but go well above and beyond to make customers happy. Case and point I am writing this review because of how amazing they were. Beyond the service which I have to say again was unbeatable, the Spanish dishes were not only 100% authentic but were incredibly good. I have had a great deal of torillas de patatas and pan con tomate in my life but these were by far the best. Everything is made fresh, so while you have to wait a bit longer for it to finish, its well worth the wait. Its a great place for tourist and local alike, I suggest you find the time in your schedule and try it out you certainly will not regret it.",
