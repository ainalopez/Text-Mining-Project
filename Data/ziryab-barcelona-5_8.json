    "One of the best meals I had during my week in Barcelona. The \"hanging brochette\" is an absolute MUST. it was seasoned deliciously and the sauce we got with it--Spicy Muhamarra--just heightened the already delicious taste. My friend also got the Bacon, Caramelised Leek & Goats Cheese Dip with pita to dip, which she loved. I visited with another friend from the United States and the wait staff was very friendly, some of the most friendly we experienced in BCN. Definitely recommend this to anyone visiting. It's a little difficult to find though... it's off of a street, down an alleyway. When we were there, there were red roman candles leading to the restaurant.",
