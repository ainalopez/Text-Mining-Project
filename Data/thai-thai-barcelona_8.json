    "This place is a little hole in the wall with some amazing food. \u00a0The place is small, like 10 tables but it was quiet. Service was fast and the food was delicious. I had the Mamasan chicken curry. It had just the right amount of spice to it. I also had fried tofu in a peanut sauce which was a tad bit oily but also quite yummy. I recommend this place if you are craving some good Thai food!",
