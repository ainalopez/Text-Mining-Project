    "It's very easy to miss this eatery because it's literally a hole in a wall and there's no apparent signs outside except for the massive amount of people crammed into the tight space eating sandwiches and drinking cava - only \u20ac3.80 per bottle! Standing room only so quicker turnover-- unless you can't help but keep drinking bottles of their inexpensive champagne.Came here for some fried sausages, bocadillos / sandwiches and got the chicken pimiento and the smoked salmon with Roquefort cheese because they ran out of anchovies.Nevertheless, everything tastes great and worth the time finding it and standing while eating.",
