    "Very cozy middle Eastern tapas bar that is hard to find. We would have walked right by if it hadn't been for the very chatty American hostess standing outside, waiving us in. They have an upstairs and downstairs with brick walls, candle light and a lounge area to smoke hookah.Menu options are very limited, mainly hummus type dips, bacon wrapped dates and such. The house red wine was excellent. The Lebanese red pepper dip was tasty but would have been much better warm, with the pita bread warm as well. This isn't the place to come to eat, but drinks are great and so is the service.",
