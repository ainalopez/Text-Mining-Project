    "I travel a lot for work and then I look for special places. This is absolutely not to miss! A nice place with a very warm and cheerful atmosphere. The service is very efficient and the waiters are absolutely nice. There was some minor problem with the order but the work it out immediately. The food is of very good quality. We tasted the fried calamari (fresh fish and light fries), a roasted pepper with cheese (delicious). I also sponsor the chicken wings ( miles away from the US heavy fried types).Also the path to reach is nice through small roads full of nice shops and people hanging around. I'll come back surely next time in Barcelona.",
