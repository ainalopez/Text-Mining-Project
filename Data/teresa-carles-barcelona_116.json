    "two words: vegetarian heaven!my love for meat is well documented and can never be rescinded but this place transforms even the harshest meat eaters. at no point during my meal did i crave for proteins in its traditional form. some of the things i tried are:-croquettas (i tried the mushroom, queso, green pepper)- pumpkin and crispy tempeh salad- red pesto pappardelle ( you MUST NOT MISS this)- pear and gorgonzola ravioli in walnut cream sauce ( to die for)- cheesecake with honey caramelized walnuts.i heard that the burger is also pretty epic. if you are in barcelona (you know who you lucky ones are) give this a try and see a modern interpretation of vegetarian food.",
