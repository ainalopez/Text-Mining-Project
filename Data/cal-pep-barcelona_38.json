    "This place is definitely worth a detour. Definitely a tourist hot spot, but the food is delicious and decor is authentic. The servers are warm and inviting but they are kind of pushy by trying to get you to order more food which is NOT cheap. From my observation, the wait is long if you are a party of two. Come early with an empty stomach and some moolah. See pictures. See for yourself.",
