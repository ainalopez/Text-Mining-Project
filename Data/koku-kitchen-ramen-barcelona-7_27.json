    "Koku is great! I had the vegetarian picante ramen which was seriously tasty, and my boyfriend raved about the pork in his picante ramen. The broth was absolutely delicious and the portions were very generous. Plus, service was friendly and fast, which was an additional bonus. Can't fault this place!",
