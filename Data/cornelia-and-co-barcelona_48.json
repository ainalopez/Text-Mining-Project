    "Visited this restaurant twice in one week. The mozzarella was memorable, the veal very good, and the tomato salad with tuna outstanding. Our first wine choice was not available, and the service is a bit slow. The decor is charming and inviting, creating a relaxing and unfussy dining experience.",
