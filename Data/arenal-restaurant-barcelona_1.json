    "A very good tiny beach restaurant you would miss, by just walking by. BUT, you need to stop and get the tapas and seafood platter. it's really worth it!!!Mixed tapas as starter and then choose your main course which will satisfy you even more. the view from the beach side to the oacean is just awesome.Go and check it out, but please call first - it's quite a busy spot with lots of locals people!",
