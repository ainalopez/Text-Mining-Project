    "During a week long stay in Barcelona my wife and I went to Les Quinze Nitz a couple of times. The patio overlooking the square was awesome. The food was delicious. The prices great. The people watching fantastic. And the service was also excellent. I would definitely go back to Les Quinze Nitz if we're ever back. I'll probably drink too much sangria too.",
