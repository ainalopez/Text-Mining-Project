    "We had an excellent meal here. The staff was incredibly welcoming and nice (the chef even came over to our table to be sure we enjoyed the meal he prepared for us). The atmosphere was also very romantic. We tried the swordfish carpaccio and the chef's special paella. We will most definitely be back! *tip: it's a great place to go have a meal before seeing a show at Palau de la Musica.",
