    "A nice, chill bar in the middle of the square. \u00a0Fairly cheap prices. \u00a0Trendy, hip crowd, as you might expect in this area.They offer locally brewed craft beer, which was not something that we saw frequently on our travels. \u00a0Coffee was not bad at all. \u00a0Good price for wine.Staff was friendly, and apologetic when mistakes were made. \u00a0A good place to stop in for a drink at the bar.",
