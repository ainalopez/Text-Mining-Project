    "My husband and I LOVED this restaurant. I was especially impressed with the design and decor, which is important to the enjoyment of the meal for me, must be comfortable and the atmosphere is romantic. The service was good, and the menu was very creative. We had the veggie sausage appetizer, and for the main, the Trio of mini burgers and the Black Truffle & Smoked Tofu Linguini was YUM YUM DELISH! \u00a0I was tempted to eat there twice during our 4 day trip! \u00a0Amazingly affordable as well with clean bathrooms, always a plus.",
