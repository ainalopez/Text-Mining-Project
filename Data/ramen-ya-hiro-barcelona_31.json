    "It beats the almost everywhere UDON in Barcelona on taste and price by a large amount. \u00a0The broth was very good and rich, not like what UDON offers. The noodle texture was a bit off, but still quite good. The place is very crowded. \u00a0Make sure you go there at opening time and get in early in line.",
