    "certainly one of the hidden gems in BCN. we happened upon the spot as we turned down a random side street while exploring, the sound of clanking bottles and laughter drew us in, so you can imagine we were quite surprised by what we found.super casual spot, fully packed with mostly locals, moderately priced drinks and a great spot to chill and socialize.there is plenty of seating indoors and out, wifi is also available, but what makes this place a good find is the back patio. i get so sick of the sidewalk seating and street side eating, sometimes i just want a quiet place to converse and have a beer, this place is exactly that. the back patio with a large fig tree with hanging lights makes for a perfect spot to hang out and drink. a bit tucked away and smoking is permitted outdoors so if second hand smoke isn't your thing then probably not a good spot for you. if you don't mind, give it a try, you won't feel like a tourist getting ripped off for over priced beers or cocktails.",
