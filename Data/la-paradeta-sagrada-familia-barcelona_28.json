    "This place has reasonable pricing for seafood. Very close to the church after our visit to the church in the morning we had to waited for the store to open. We were sitting on the bench nearby park but the next thing we knew is when we turned around there was a line already lining up in front of the store. The restaurant need more organization as we were on the line there were more people coming in and passed the line and wanted to skipped and rush to order. The shrimps \u00a0and clams was delicious like everyone mentioned on yelp. The squids I don't care for the salad and soup was not necessary but we didn't know till it was too late. \u00a0Overall great experience.",
