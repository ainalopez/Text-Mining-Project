    "Pluses- English speaking waiters- English menus both printed and on the board- Food was SUPER yummyOrdered- El Pulpo + Artichoke - lovely garlicky sauce, the octopus was done just right not to chewy, not too rubbery- Broken yolk with (black) truffle, mushroom and foie gras (a must-have if you like foie and truffle)- Braised beef cheek - i was too full to really enjoy this but super tender piece of meatI went by myself, I was full by the time I finished the egg dish,Cons- Happened to be filled with loud brash americans. Can we stop perpetuating the loud brash american stereotype please?- The restaurant? right across appears to be EVEN more crowded",
