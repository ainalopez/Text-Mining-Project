    "Really one of the best vegetarian restaurants my partner and I have ever been to--and we're urban Americans, who have been on the vegetarian spectrum for 15 years, and have been to a lot of them. So to find a great, incredibly cute and intimate vegetarian restaurant in Spain--the heart of cured ham?! Such a treat! My partner and I went to lunch here after seeing Gaudi's Sagrada Familia--and though it was a good twenty minute walk away, it was well worth the walk. We got there around Spanish lunch time (about 2:30/3pm) and had to wait for a table, but again, it was well worth the wait--even though I'm pregnant and was in pregnancy-hunger panic. Their juices are fantastic; their salads so fresh and with delightfully interesting ingredient combinations; and their sandwiches are very, very good. I just wish I had tried the veggie burger (a German couple sitting near us said it was outstanding). We also had a zuma (I'm forgetting the exact combo now, but it involved carrot and ginger) and a lemonade with grapefruit and lime (a bright, lovely zinger)--both of which hit the spot. And as others have mentioned: holy good goddess of vegan splendors, that carrot-coconut cake. It is really one of the best cakes--vegan or otherwise--I have ever eaten. I wanted to be alone in a room with it; I want to sing a whole musical devoted to it and its creator. I cannot believe it exists, it is that good.",
