    "First of all, the staff is incredible! Laura recommended a series of dishes to us that we're absolutely delicious. Wine selection good again, she recommended a good match for the food. We had lamb, pork cheeks, beef all of these were totally out of this world. To finish the meal, we told her to surprise us with a good dessert, she brought something called \"borracho\" which was a brownie with a little bit of rum and vanilla ice cream. When eaten all together the balance was perfect ! We are planning to go back this week.",
