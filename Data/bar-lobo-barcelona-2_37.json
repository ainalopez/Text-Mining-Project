    "This is the first place we stopped once we got to Barcelona. A little expensive but we really liked the food. They had a lunch special that included either spanish tortilla or toast with tomato and ham, a juice and coffee. This was my introduction to the amazing Spain coffee. I never drink coffee and while in Spain I was drinking 3 cups/day. Anyway, the tortilla was outstanding and totally different to what you can find in the US. Great place to grab a quick bite.",
