    "This was our first stop in Barcelona after getting in from LA, and it was a great introduction to Catalan cuisine. \u00a0It's very charming with just the right amount of service without being stuffy. \u00a0After the end of our trip and evaluating all of the fancy 1,2,3 michelin star restaurants, this was a great value and a nice and relaxing way to start our trip. \u00a0I can't remember everything that we had, except there was a fruit \"soup\" that was fantastically refreshing for end of May.",
